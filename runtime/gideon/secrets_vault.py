"""The secrets vault read model — presence, scope and consumers, never a value (EI-10).

🔴 **PRESENCE-ONLY IS STRUCTURAL HERE, NOT A REDACTION STEP.** The distinction is the whole
point of this module existing at all instead of the vault being three helpers inside a handler.

A redaction design reads the value, then filters it out on the way to the wire. That design is
one careless line from a leak — every handler holds the secret in a local, and the only thing
stopping it reaching the client is that nobody returned that local. It also leans on
``redact_credentials``, which is **not idempotent over a composed ``field: value`` line**, so a
value that reaches a formatter has already escaped the mechanism meant to catch it.

This module instead makes the value *unreachable*:

* :class:`SecretPresence` is a DIFFERENT TYPE from anything that carries a secret. It has no
  value field, no ``value`` property and no ``__getattr__``, so there is no expression over a
  ``SecretPresence`` that evaluates to a credential. A future handler that returns one whole,
  or spreads it, or logs it, cannot leak — not because it was careful, but because the object
  it holds never contained the secret.
* The only credential-store call in this module's import graph is
  :func:`~gideon.config.credentials.credential_names`, which reads key names on both
  backends without materialising a value (its ``.env`` half splits the line and keeps the left
  side). ``get_credential`` / ``load_credentials`` / ``_dotenv_credentials`` are deliberately
  **not imported here**, and ``tests/test_secrets_vault.py`` asserts that statically over this
  file's source — so the property is a rail, not a habit.

Redaction still runs downstream. It is the backstop; this is the mechanism.

**Three scopes, because their trust stories differ and the UI must not blur them.**

``global``  a credential in the store, usable by anything on this instance.
``project`` a credential in the SAME store under a namespaced key (:data:`PROJECT_KEY_PREFIX`),
            scoped by convention to one project. There is deliberately **no second store and no
            per-project index file**: namespacing the key means the keychain backend (SH-1), the
            ``.env`` 0600 floor, the union read, and — critically — the inventory's
            ``secret=True`` projection into ``portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE`` all apply to a project
            secret for free. A sidecar index would have needed every one of those re-derived, and
            the one that was missed would be the one that leaked.
``host``    a credential-shaped name present in the gateway's OWN environment that the vault does
            not hold. **The value lives in the host environment, not in the vault**, so the vault
            cannot show it, rotate it, or delete it — which is exactly why it is a first-class row
            type rather than a footnote. Rendering it identically to a vault row would tell the
            user the vault is managing something it has no control over.

The secret-name TEST for a host row is ``workspace.looks_secret`` over
``workflows.secrets.SECRET_KEY_HINTS`` — reused, not restated, for the reason that module already
gives: a second list of credential-ish fragments drifts, and the drifted copy is the one that
lets a token through.

**Consumers are DERIVED, never indexed.** ``consumers_for`` walks the workflow definitions and
triggers that actually exist and reports which of them reference ``{{secret:KEY}}``, through the
two shipped reference readers (``workflows.secrets.secret_keys_referenced`` and
``triggers.secrets.references``). A maintained ``secret → consumers`` table would be a count kept
beside a table: it can disagree with the specs in two directions at once (a stale entry pointing
at a deleted workflow, and a fresh reference nothing recorded), and neither is visible from the
table alone. Derivation cannot drift from the thing it derives from.
