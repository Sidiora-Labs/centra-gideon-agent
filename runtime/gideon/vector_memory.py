# statement about the harness, and only §2.6's compact snapshot may inject it —
# never the fact block.
# `user.approval.*` joins them (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.4 — PA-1). An approval rule
# is the harness's model of how the user wants it to BEHAVE, consulted by an exact
# prefix lookup at triage time. Injected as a fact it would read as a claim about
# the user ("archive:sender:noreply.github.com"), so it is excluded here.
# `slot.*` joins them (MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §6 — MGAV-8). A slot already injects through its
# OWN bounded block in `build_session_context`, so leaving it in the fact block would charge the
# same text to the budget twice AND miscategorise the harness-facing slots: `slot.self_notes`
# read back as a fact would assert the assistant's working notes as claims about the user.

        necessarily the number the gate compared. Two derivations would be two
        answers to "is this injected?" and the studio would eventually lie.

        Fails OPEN — every lesson reads as injected at full confidence if the
        evidence store cannot be reached. An injection filter that fails CLOSED
        would silently strip the user's own standing rules out of every prompt,
        which is far worse than an over-permissive one.
