"""``visualize(data, hint)`` — the one agency-free generative-UI primitive
(AMBIENT-SURFACES §5.3).

The two-step pattern: a reasoning agent produces *data*; this SEPARATE, no-tools
step renders it into a genui widget spec. It is "agency-free" by construction — it
resolves through :func:`one_shot_completion` on the **reasoning** use-case axis,
which builds a plain model provider (never the NativeAgentRuntime that ``chat``/
``code_tools`` return), so there are no tools to call: it can only turn data into a
widget spec, never act. Output is constrained to the registry DSL (``genui.py``'s
catalog) and validated FE-side per §5.2 (unknown/invalid lines drop, never crash).

One shared mechanism behind every producer — the ``visualize`` MCP tool, the
WORKFLOWS-V2 ``visualize`` node, cockpit summaries, tiles, digests, "chart this"
chat asks. Keeping the single ``one_shot_completion`` call here (not duplicated in
each caller) is why only THIS file appears in the degraded-contract lint map.
