"""Safe-surfaces mode — the server half of the layered surface overlay.

Lives in CORE, not under ``dashboard/``: the gateway entry point (`cli_server._gateway`) has
to latch it before anything serves a page, and core importing the HTTP surface is the upward
dependency `scripts/gate_report.py`'s import-direction gate refuses. The HTTP surface imports
DOWN into this module instead (the status handler, the index handler) — which is the inversion
that gate asks for rather than a raised violation count.

AMBIENT-SURFACES §6. The SPA resolves three surface layers: L0 core (the shipped
bundle), L1 app (app-contributed pages and genui components), L2 user/agent overlays.
Safe mode forces ``maxLayer = 0`` — pure L0 — and there are deliberately TWO ways in:

* ``#/dashboard?safe=1`` — the URL a user can be read over the phone. Owned by the SPA.
* ``--safe-surfaces`` — this module. The lever that works when the client cannot render
  its own address bar, and the one an operator can set once for the whole process.

The flag is a PROCESS latch, not config: it is a recovery decision about this run of the
gateway, and persisting it would mean a user who recovered once boots into safe mode
forever. It is also one-way within a process — a later ``set_safe_surfaces(False)``
cannot clear it, because nothing in a running gateway has the authority to decide that
the operator's recovery flag is over.

How the SPA learns it: a ``<meta>`` tag injected into ``index.html`` at serve time. NOT
a fetch — the layer ceiling has to be known before the first app module loads, and a
bootstrap request that lands after that decision would make the flag advisory. It is
also reported on ``/api/status`` so the CLI/doctor can say the gateway is in safe mode.
