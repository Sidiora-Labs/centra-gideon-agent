"""Portable zip export/import for Gideon state — the DSAR surface (§6).

Creates a zip archive of Gideon state for download via the dashboard, and
restores from uploaded zip archives. Designed to work over HTTP for remote users
(e.g. remote Linux server → local browser).

Two properties this module exists to guarantee, both now enforced by construction
rather than by a hand-maintained list:

* **`secret ∪ derived` never leaves the machine.** Every write site runs through
  :func:`_is_excluded`, which projects the inventory's ``secret=True`` *and*
  ``derived=True`` entries. Measured before this was true: the export's hardcoded
  database list carried ``memory_index.db`` — declared ``derived=True`` — so a
  "portable export" shipped a stale vector index that a restore would then pair
  with a newer store, the exact hazard `inventory.export_entries()` documents.
* **An export declares its own scope.** A per-domain export (memory / knowledge /
  work / automation / platform / config) carries only that domain's declared
  entries, and prunes every *other* domain's entries out of the tree walks — so a
  ``platform`` export cannot smuggle ``workspace/knowledge/files`` (the user's
  documents) out under cover of the ``workspace`` tree.

MANIFEST versions (:data:`SUPPORTED_MANIFEST_VERSIONS`): v1/v2 carry sizes only;
**v3 carries per-member ``bytes`` + ``sha256`` plus ``schema_version``/``machine_id``
(§2's integrity shape)**, so :func:`validate_import_zip` can detect a corrupted
archive before an import writes anything. v1/v2 zips still import — there is simply
nothing to verify them against, which is stated rather than silently assumed.

    * ``merge`` is **copy-if-missing on every path**. A failure part-way leaves the home

      home already had is ever touched, so a partial merge is a *subset* of a complete
      one and re-running it is safe and idempotent. There is no hybrid to be left in.
    * ``replace`` moves each live path into ``pre-restore-<ts>/`` **before** writing the
      incoming one (`snapshot._do_replace`), so a failure part-way leaves the displaced
      originals on disk under that directory and the summary reports its path. That
      directory is the recovery: it is removed only when it ends up empty, i.e. only
      when nothing was displaced. A replace that dies mid-way is therefore recoverable
      by hand, which is the honest guarantee — a "hybrid home" with no trace of what it
      replaced is what this ordering exists to prevent.
