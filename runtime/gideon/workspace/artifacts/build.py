"""React artifact build path — build once, serve static (PEP-9).

A ``kind='react'`` artifact's body is JSX defining a top-level ``App`` component,
authored against the ``React``/``ReactDOM`` globals (the contract
``web/src/ui/widget/widgetSrcdoc.ts`` established for the in-chat preview). That
preview transforms the JSX **in the browser** with Babel and pulls React from a
CDN — fine for a bubble, impossible for a deployed page: PEP-8's serve route
fences the document with ``default-src 'none'`` and ``connect-src 'none'``, so a
served page can load only ``'self'``. Hence this module: transform and bundle the
JSX **once, on the server**, and write plain static files into the artifact's
``webapp/`` directory for :func:`~gideon.workspace.artifacts.handlers.serve_deployed_artifact`
to hand out. No per-artifact dev server, no CDN, no runtime transform.

Three properties are load-bearing.

*The build rides the resource-limited spawn.* An artifact body is arbitrary
model- or user-authored source, and a bundler run over it is exactly the
unbounded-spawn hazard PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1 exists to bound. So the one
spawn here goes through :func:`gideon.security.sandbox.create_subprocess_limited`
with :data:`~gideon.security.sandbox.PROFILE_BUILD` — the same profile the model
sidecar's installer and the loop's worktree git steps use — and there is no
second, unwrapped path. ``tests/test_spawn_ceiling_audit.py`` censuses the site;
``tests/test_artifact_react_build.py`` proves the ceiling reaches the child by
reading the child's own ``ulimit``.

*The build never reaches the network.* The toolchain is **discovered, never
installed**: :func:`resolve_toolchain` looks for an already-present
``node_modules`` that carries ``esbuild``, ``react`` and ``react-dom``, and a
host without one gets a legible refusal instead of an ``npm install``. The argv
is core-owned and fixed (an ``esbuild --bundle`` invocation — esbuild resolves
imports on disk and has no remote fetch), the artifact contributes only *source*,
and the child environment comes from :func:`gideon.security.sandbox.build_child_env`
so it does not even inherit the operator's proxy configuration. That covers the
*build*; it does NOT by itself cover the *bundle*, and the difference was measured:
esbuild silently treats ``import x from 'https://esm.sh/lodash'`` as external and
bakes the URL into the output at rc 0 with no warning. So the build reads the
bundler's own metafile and refuses any import left outside the bundle
(:func:`external_imports`) — a deployed page must fetch nothing.

*A failure is reported, never swallowed, and never a hang.* Every failure mode
raises :class:`ArtifactBuildError`, whose message is a WHAT — WHY. Fix: FIX
sentence, and the deploy route returns that sentence in the standard
``{"error": ...}`` envelope so ``errText`` puts it in front of the user
verbatim. A build that stops making progress is killed at
:data:`BUILD_TIMEOUT_SECS` and reported as a timeout. Nothing is written into the
artifact's served files unless the bundle actually came out, so a failed build
can never leave a half-built app published.
