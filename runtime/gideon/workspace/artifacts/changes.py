"""In-process artifact change notifications (PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY §6.1 choice 2).

The gateway is the only writer of the artifact store, so mirroring artifacts into another
subsystem needs an OBSERVER, not a poller: a watched directory is polled because an editor
outside the process edits it, while an artifact only ever changes because a handler, an
MCP tool or a chat tool called :class:`~gideon.workspace.artifacts.native.NativeArtifactProvider`.
A signature-diff loop over ``<home>/artifacts`` would re-stat the whole library forever to
learn something the writing call already knew.

**The vocabulary is deliberately two words** — ``upsert`` and ``delete``. Artifacts do not
own the knowledge library's ``created``/``modified``/``deleted`` change vocabulary
(``knowledge_providers.base``): translating "this artifact now has this body" into
create-vs-modify requires knowing whether the MIRROR already exists, which is knowledge-side
state. Emitting three words from here would mean this module deciding a question it cannot
see the answer to, and a wrong guess would either duplicate a mirror row or drop an edit.

**A listener never breaks a write.** :func:`emit` swallows and logs every listener
exception: an artifact save is the user's work and a downstream indexing fault must not turn
a successful save into a 500. That is the fail-open direction, chosen because the write has
already happened by the time a listener runs — refusing after the fact is not available.
