"""SheetModel → UTF-8 CSV bytes using the standard-library dialect, and CSV text by the same rule.

**No cell is written so that a spreadsheet would evaluate it.** A CSV says nothing about what
its cells are, so a spreadsheet program opening one decides from each cell's text, and it reads a
cell whose text begins with ``=``, ``+``, ``-`` or ``@`` as a formula (some programs drop a
leading tab or carriage return first). A CSV's cells come from wherever the agent, an app or a
workflow found them: a page, a message, an imported file. So every cell is written by one rule,
applied to the text written for it:

* text that begins with ``=``, ``+``, ``-``, ``@``, a tab or a carriage return is written with a
  single quote (``'``) in front of it, which a spreadsheet shows as text and never evaluates. A
  byte-order mark before that character changes nothing, since a spreadsheet drops one that
  opens the file before it reads the first cell;
* except a number, which holds nothing a spreadsheet could compute and is written as it is: an
  optional sign, an optional currency sign, then only digits, commas and periods (at least one
  digit), an optional exponent, and an optional percent or currency sign at the end (``-20``,
  ``-1,234.56``, ``-$45.20``, ``-12.5%``, ``+1.5e3``). A cell the model holds as a number is
  written as that text, so a negative number stays a number. A cell of dashes alone (``-``, a
  table's "none") holds nothing to compute either and is written as it is too;
* every other cell is written as it is, a date among them.

A formula cell is no exception: a CSV cannot say that a cell is a formula, so its text is written
by the same rule and shows as text.

:func:`render_csv` writes a sheet's cells by the rule. :func:`render_csv_text` writes CSV text by
it, for a CSV whose text was written elsewhere: the artifact store keeps every CSV artifact's text
through it, whoever wrote that text.
