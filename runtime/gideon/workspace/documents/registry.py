"""Format → writer lookup.

Mirrors the shape of `artifacts/registry.py`: a dict keyed by name, one `register()` per
format. ``available_formats`` reports what is USABLE right now rather than what is
declared, because a tool that offers a format and then fails mid-generation is worse than
one that says up front it can't.
