""".xlsx bytes → :class:`SheetModel` + a :class:`LossReport`.

The READ half of the spreadsheet round trip. Without it a sheet could be written but
never loaded, so the editing surface had nothing to edit and no formula could survive a
lap: ``documents/writers/xlsx_writer.py`` could put ``=SUM(A1)`` in a file, and reading
it back gave the *string* ``"=SUM(A1)"`` with no way to tell it from a label.

**A formula is recognised from the FILE, not from the text.** openpyxl reports a cell's
own ``data_type``, so ``"f"`` means the file said formula and ``"s"`` means the file said
string — even when both hold text starting with ``=``. That is the whole reason the
distinction survives, and it is why this parser never inspects the leading character.

**Every parse lives beside a loss report, same contract as the docx parser.** A
spreadsheet holds a great deal this model does not (charts, pivot tables, conditional
formatting, data validation, borders, per-row heights), and the editor re-renders from
the model — so anything not represented here is gone the moment a save lands. It is
reported, never dropped silently, and located in the sheet's own terms (``Sales!C2``).
