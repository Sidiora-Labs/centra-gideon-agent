"""The onboarding-import vocabulary — scan results, items, and write outcomes.

One shape for "something another local agent tool has that Gideon could adopt"
(:class:`ImportItem`), one shape for what a scan found (:class:`ScanResult`), and one
closed four-value outcome vocabulary for what a writer did (:class:`WriteOutcome`).

Two properties are load-bearing and live here rather than in each scanner:

- **Fingerprint idempotence.** An item's identity is ``sha256(source\\0category\\0key)``
  — stable across re-scans and independent of the item's body, so re-importing an
  edited file updates nothing it already owns and never creates a second copy.
- **Secret-free payloads.** An item carries a redacted body and a secret-stripped
  structured payload. A scanner that finds a credential *counts* it
  (``ScanResult.secrets_skipped``) and drops it; the value never reaches an item, a
  note, a log line, or an error message.
