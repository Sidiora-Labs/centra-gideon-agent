"""`gideon project export|import` — one project as a manifest ZIP (S54, C9).

Distinct from `snapshot`, which is whole-home. A user handing a colleague one project has no
business shipping their memory database, and the archive's secret exclusion plus per-entity digests
are what make the narrower artifact safe to send.

Both commands REPORT what did not travel. An export that prints only "wrote 12 entities" hides the
two facts the user has to act on — what was skipped, and which credentials the far side will ask for
— and the archive itself cannot tell them, because the whole point is that the values are absent.
