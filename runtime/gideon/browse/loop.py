"""The browse loop — perceive, decide, act, verify, park (BA-3, plan §7).

BA-1 gave us perception (``extraction`` → ``compress``) and the sentinel action language
(``sentinels``); BA-2 gave us a navigation path that cannot leave the BROWSE egress policy
(:class:`~gideon.browse.cdp.GatedCdpSession`). This module is the driver that turns
those into a bounded, auditable agent loop, and it is the ONLY consumer of both.

The cycle, per plan §7::

    navigate (egress-checked)  →  extract  →  FENCE  →  decide  →  act
                                     ↑                              │
                                     └──────────────────────────────┘

Four properties are load-bearing, and each is a guard with a way to fail:

**Every page is fenced.** ``fence_untrusted`` wraps the rendered outline before it reaches
the model, once per page — not once per run. Web content is attacker-controlled: a page that
enters context unfenced is the prompt-injection this whole atom exists to bound, and a loop
that fenced only the first page would be indistinguishable from a working one until the
second page attacked it. :func:`assert_no_base64` runs on the same string, so a screenshot
that stopped being a path fails loudly here rather than silently costing a megabyte of
context.

**The loop terminates.** ``max_steps`` (default 20) is a hard ceiling, ``STUCK_REPEAT_LIMIT``
catches a model looping on one action, and the budget is re-checked BEFORE each model call —
where the call actually happens, not in a helper a caller could route around. Exhaustion is
not a failure: it PARKS, preserving the notes accumulated so far, because a browse run that
ran out of steps has usually done most of the work and throwing it away costs the user the
whole task.

**A SUBMIT is verified, not assumed.** §7.1: a form post whose outcome nobody checked is the
single most common way an autonomous browse silently does nothing (or does it twice). After
every SUBMIT the loop waits for a URL change or a content delta, re-extracts, and asks the
model to judge FORM_OK / FORM_FAILED — a second model call, deliberately, because "the page
changed" and "the submission worked" are different questions.

**Nothing here knows about a provider, a workflow or a gateway.** The loop takes a
``decide`` callable and a :class:`PageDriver`; the ActionProvider that supplies the real ones
lives in ``action_providers.browse_provider``. That is what makes the loop testable without a
browser and without a model.
