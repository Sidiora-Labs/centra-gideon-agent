"""The browse kill switch (BROWSE-AUTOMATION §(b) — the mirror's one-click stop).

One flag — ``~/.gideon/browse_kill.json`` (``{active, reason, started_at}``) — stops all
UNATTENDED browsing: a running browse loop parks within one step, and a new browse run refuses to
start. It is checked at the two seams that spend a browser — the provider before it opens one, and
the loop before each model call — for the same reason the incident switch is checked at its seams
rather than mutating a store: a gate one level away from the work is bypassed by the next caller.

**Distinct from the incident kill switch, on purpose.** ``guardrails.incident`` suspends ALL
unattended work (cron, hooks, triggers, subagents, browse); this stops ONLY browse. The mirror
panel puts a stop button one click from "that page looks wrong" without the collateral of halting
every other automation the user has running — a scalpel beside the incident switch's hammer.
Killing browse never touches interactive chat, and re-enabling it is EXPLICIT (the release call),
so a stop is never silently undone.

The shape mirrors ``guardrails.incident`` deliberately (same file/flag/mtime-mirror discipline) so
there is one way to reason about a kill switch in this codebase, not two:

* **Opt-IN, fail toward NOT killed.** A missing or unreadable file means "not killed" — the normal,
  overwhelmingly common state. Flipping browse off on a transient read error would be the wrong
  failure mode for a control whose whole job is to be deliberate.
* **In-process mirror refreshed from the file's mtime**, so a flag flipped by another process (a
  CLI, another gateway worker) is picked up without a restart.
* **Engage/release are SEL-audited**, so the evidentiary record the amendment requires — that a
  human directed the stop — exists.
