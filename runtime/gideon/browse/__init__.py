"""Autonomous browse perception layer — token-frugal STRUCTURAL page reading (BA-1).

Two standalone, pure modules that turn HTML into a compact, ref-addressable representation an
agent can act on, plus the sentinel action language it emits back:

  * ``extraction`` — walk the DOM into text (≤4000 chars) + a Links DSL + a Forms DSL, with a
    STABLE ``ElementRef`` per interactive element (survives a re-snapshot after unrelated DOM
    mutation — the load-bearing property for "CLICK <ref>" meaning the same thing next step).
  * ``compress`` — fold the extraction into a ``PageOutline`` under a token budget (<1K tokens
    for a 100K-token DOM), with the screenshot referenced by PATH, never inlined as base64.
  * ``sentinels`` — ``parse_sentinel`` turns an LLM's text (``CLICK <ref>``, ``TYPE <ref>(v)``,
    …) into typed ``Action`` objects that round-trip back to their sentinel line.

No network, no gateway, no config — the browse LOOP that drives these (CDP, egress, the
ActionProvider) lands in later BA atoms.
