"""The real CDP wire behind :class:`gideon.browse.cdp.CdpTransport` (BA-2).

``browse/cdp.py`` defines the transport as a Protocol so the gate can be asserted on the
messages it writes rather than on a return value. That Protocol had no production
implementor: every proof of "a denied host produces zero ``Page.navigate``" ran against a
recording fake, and a fake cannot show that Chrome's own ``Page.frameNavigated`` reaches
:meth:`~gideon.browse.cdp.GatedCdpSession.handle_event` at all. This module is that
implementor — one WebSocket to one already-open page target, nothing more.

**Deliberately NOT here: launching a browser.** No Chrome discovery, no ``--user-data-dir``,
no process supervision. Two reasons, both from the plan rather than from convenience:
BROWSE-AUTOMATION §5.1 gives *persistent per-site profiles* to BA-4, and §4.1 leaves open
whether the gateway shares the interactive chrome-devtools MCP's browser instead of starting
its own. Choosing either here would pre-empt an owner decision, so the caller supplies a page
target's ``webSocketDebuggerUrl`` and owns the process. Tests launch their own.

THE ONE STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT, and the reason this is not fifty lines: **the read loop must
never await the event listener.** The listener is ``GatedCdpSession.handle_event``, and its
job on a denied redirect is to *send* — ``Page.stopLoading`` then ``Page.navigate`` — on this
same socket. Awaiting the listener inline from the frame reader would mean the only task that
can resolve that send's response future is parked inside the send. The teardown would hang
until its timeout, and the guard's enforcement would silently become a no-op on a live
browser while every fake-transport test stayed green. So there are two tasks: a reader that
only routes, and a dispatcher that only calls the listener. Events stay ordered because the
dispatcher is single and takes them off one queue.

Failure posture matches the session's: a dead socket, a CDP error reply and a lost response
all raise out of :meth:`WebSocketCdpTransport.send`, and ``GatedCdpSession`` turns a raising
send into a quarantine. A hung request is capped by ``request_timeout`` rather than waiting
forever, because "the browser never answered" must not read as "the navigation was fine".
