"""The credential screen — BA-4's *credentials-never-transit-the-agent* invariant, structurally.

BROWSE-AUTOMATION §5.2 states the invariant as a promise: "the LLM never sees a password field's
value, never receives a 2FA code, never handles an OAuth token". A promise is enforced by whoever
remembers it. This module is the mechanism that makes it hold whether anyone remembers or not, and
the shape of that mechanism is the whole point of the file, so it is worth stating plainly.

**Why redaction alone cannot be the answer.** :func:`gideon.security.redact_credentials` is
SHAPE- and NAME-based: it knows `sk-ant-…`, `ghp_…` and `name = value` assignments. A human password
(`hunter2`) matches none of them, and a 2FA code (`418290`) matches nothing that is not also a
line number. So a design where the credential travels and a redactor tries to catch it fails for
exactly the inputs this invariant is about. It is also **not idempotent over a composed
`field: value` line** — a second application garbles the field name — which forbids the tempting
"redact everything on the way out" posture: composition happens many times, so the screen must
happen ONCE, at the boundary, BEFORE composition.

**So the invariant is three refusals, not a filter.**

1. **A credential field's value is never READ.** :func:`is_credential_input` decides at the single
   point where ``extraction._handle_input`` turns an ``<input>`` into a record. For a credential
   input the record carries :data:`WITHHELD` unconditionally — not the value, and not "the value if
   non-empty", because whether a password box is prefilled is itself a fact about the user's
   credential store. The value therefore does not exist anywhere in the browse process's state, so
   there is no downstream consumer to audit, no ordering to get right, and no second pass to
   garble. This is the difference between "we remembered not to log it" and "there is nothing to
   log".

2. **The agent cannot WRITE one either.** The loop refuses ``TYPE <ref>(…)`` into a credential
   field and escalates to the ``request_login`` handoff instead (see
   :mod:`gideon.browse.handoff`). That refusal is what makes the human handoff the ONLY
   authentication path rather than the polite one: a model that hallucinated a password could not
   spend it, and a caller that supplied one on the action config could not either. It also closes
   the echo: :func:`screen_action_render` replaces the value in the rendered action line, which is
   the string that reaches the stuck-detector, the next prompt's WARNINGS block, the step ledger,
   the SEL row and the parked run's user-facing sentence. Screening it at the render site is the
   "once, before composition" rule applied to the model's own output.

3. **A credential in a URL is never composed in.** The post-login redirect is where an OAuth
   ``code``/``access_token``/``id_token`` actually shows up, and a URL reaches the model through
   three separate paths (the outline's ``# <url>`` header, the fence's ``source``/``source_id``, and
   a link's rendered target) plus three user/audit paths (the park sentence, the run payload, the
   SEL ``resources`` field). :func:`screen_url` replaces the VALUE and keeps the KEY, so
   ``?code=[withheld]&country=US`` stays diagnosable — a URL redacted to nothing turns "the login
   redirect landed somewhere unexpected" into an unanswerable question.

**Deliberately value-replacing, never whole-string.** Every function here removes a value and
leaves its surroundings intact, for the reason `security.redact_url_userinfo` records: taking out
the secret must not take out the ability to read the line. And every replacement is a literal
containing characters the thing it replaces cannot contain, so re-running any of these over its own
output is a no-op — idempotence by construction, not by a guard a later session could delete.

#: sees the same word every time and learns it means "the agent never had this".
WITHHELD = "[withheld]"

#: ``<input type=…>`` values whose content is a credential by definition. Type-based first because
#: it is the one signal a site cannot get wrong without breaking its own login: a password box is
#: ``type=password`` or browsers will not mask it.
CREDENTIAL_INPUT_TYPES: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"password"})

#: ``autocomplete`` tokens that declare a credential on a field whose ``type`` is plain text. Real
#: login forms use these: a one-time-code box is almost always ``type=text
#: autocomplete=one-time-code`` (so the keyboard shows digits and the value is not masked), which
#: means a type-only rule would miss every 2FA field — the exact input the invariant names.
CREDENTIAL_AUTOCOMPLETE: frozenset[str] = frozenset(
    {"current-password", "new-password", "one-time-code"}

#: Substrings in a field's ``name``/``id`` that mean "a secret goes here". The weakest of the three
#: signals and deliberately last: it is a heuristic over author-chosen identifiers, so it is scoped
#: to tokens that have no innocent reading on a form field. ``code`` alone is NOT here — a postal
#: code, a country code and a discount code are all ``code``, and screening those would blind the
#: agent to fields it legitimately fills while protecting nothing.

#: authorization code — a single-use credential — and the cost of screening a country code in a
#: query string is that the agent reads ``?code=[withheld]`` and can still follow the link by ref.
#: ``state`` is deliberately ABSENT: it is a CSRF nonce, not a credential, and screening it would
