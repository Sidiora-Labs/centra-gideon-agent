"""The ONE guarded door an inbound channel message enters the platform through (EA-7).

``channel_trust`` shipped a complete trust store — ``guard_inbound``, pairing codes, the
unknown-sender flow, the content fence — and then shipped with **zero
production callers**. Every transport was expected to call the gate itself, at the top of
its own inbound path, by convention. Three app transports did. That is fail-OPEN in
aggregate: a transport that simply *omits* the call reaches a live agent session with no
check at all, and nothing in core notices. For a control whose entire purpose is to be
fail-CLOSED, "every implementor remembered" is not a property, it is a hope.

**What this module is.** The single function a transport hands an inbound message to —
:func:`deliver_inbound` — which applies trust and *then* routes to a session. A transport
no longer decides whether to check; it decides only whether to use the platform's inbound
door, and the door is guarded. The gate is reached through the gateway's
:class:`~gideon.gateway_services.GatewayServices` handle
(``services.deliver_channel_inbound``), which is what the transport already holds from
``start_inbound`` — so no transport ABC changed and a transport that never calls
``guard_inbound`` itself is still checked.

**It is a chokepoint, not a second copy of the policy.**
:func:`~gideon.channel_trust.guard_inbound` remains the one decision function and
this module never re-derives a verdict: it calls the gate, caches the answer per message,
and acts on it. Nothing here is a policy — including pairing redemption, which happens
inside the gate under the provider's DM policy and *not* on the way to it. This module
once redeemed a code before the gate and regardless of policy, which silently levelled
``dm_policy="owner_only"`` down to ``pairing``; see :func:`_decide`.

**Idempotent per message — the double-notification hazard.** A denied unknown sender has
side effects: :func:`~gideon.channel_trust.note_unknown_sender` raises an actionable
owner notification and writes a ``sender_denied`` SEL row. Three app transports already
call ``guard_inbound`` themselves, so while they migrate to this door a single inbound
message can be presented to the trust vocabulary twice. Two independent mechanisms make
that safe, and they are deliberately not the same mechanism:

1. **This module's admission cache** (:data:`_ADMISSION_CACHE_MAX` entries, keyed by
   provider + message identity) returns the FIRST verdict for a message and never
   re-enters the gate — so the property "one inbound message produces at most one
   notification" holds *per message*, independent of any time window.
2. **The store's renotify window**
   (:data:`~gideon.channel_trust.UNKNOWN_SENDER_RENOTIFY_SECS`, 24h) dedupes on
   persisted per-sender state and returns ``False`` *before* emitting the SEL row or
   calling ``state.notify``, so even a second call that bypasses this module entirely
   (an un-migrated transport's own ``guard_inbound``) cannot double-notify.

Mechanism 2 alone would leave the per-message property as a mere corollary of a
flood-control window — shorten the window and double-notification returns. Mechanism 1 is
what makes it a property. ``tests/test_channel_inbound_chokepoint.py`` asserts both,
including with the window monkeypatched to zero.

**Fail-closed.** A message is routed only on an explicit ``allowed`` verdict. There is no
branch that routes on an error, an unreadable store, or an unknown policy: the trust
store's own read path falls back to defaults, and the default DM policy is ``pairing`` —
absence of data means "not trusted".

**Fail-closed, not fail-quiet.** Failing closed silently made a healthy socket that
discards a message indistinguishable from a dead one. Every disposition is announced by the
gate's single reporter, :func:`~gideon.channel_trust.report_inbound_verdict`, reached
from inside :func:`~gideon.channel_trust.guard_inbound` — the one function every
verdict is now minted in, pairing redemption included. The two paths this module owns that
the gate never sees are reported here instead: an admission-cache hit (DEBUG — a redelivery
of an already-decided message is the routine dedup) and a missing dashboard state (WARNING
in :func:`_route_to_session` — an allowed message that still cannot reach a session).
