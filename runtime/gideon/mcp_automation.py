"""In-process MCP surface for the `automation_*` tools (§4 — S92).

Exposes ``_list_tools`` / ``_call_tool`` (the same shape as ``mcp_core`` / ``mcp_schedule``), so
the native ``InProcessMcpToolProvider`` and the aggregating ``mcp-core`` server both surface these
tools in chat. Without this module `triggers/tools.py` would be a tested library nothing calls —
the present-and-inert defect this whole program keeps finding, and the exact thing S83 warned
about when it deferred criterion 2 for lack of a store to write to.

The tool LOGIC lives in `triggers/tools.py` (pure functions over a `TriggerStore`, driven end to
end in tests without a model). This module is the thin adapter: schema in, store built from
`config_dir()`, `ToolResult.text` out. Keeping the two apart is what let the logic be tested
against the real store while this layer stays a translation with nothing to hide.

**Runner boundary.** `automation_run` needs the LLM turn, which this stdio-shaped surface does not
own — S90's executor + `SubagentManager.spawn` do. So an immediate run routes through the gateway's
HTTP `/run` (the shipped `schedule_trigger` pattern the plan's recon note calls out) rather than
executing here; a `dry_run` needs no turn and is answered locally.
