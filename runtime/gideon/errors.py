"""Platform-wide WHAT/WHY/FIX error envelope (PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY §2).

A failure returned into an LLM session is only useful if the model can act on it.
:class:`AgentError` carries the three facts that turn a dead-end into a
self-correction: **what** failed (with the concrete value), **why** (the
mechanism), and the exact **fix** (the next action) — plus optional
``suggestions`` (did-you-mean candidates the model can branch to). The harness
research this follows measured this shape converting failures into recovery
loops; the point is that the model reads structure, not prose.

**Distinct from the HTTP error envelope.** `AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" →
**Error envelope (HTTP)** owns the *wire* shape for API-route errors —
``{"error": {"code": "<lowercase_snake>", "message": ...}}`` — a thing a
browser/external client branches on, emitted by the one
:func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error` and registered in
:data:`gideon.http_errors.HTTP_ERROR_CODES`. ``AgentError`` is the carrier
*into an LLM session* (on ``ToolResult``/``ActionResult`` and the exceptions that
become tool-result text). The two never collide: HTTP codes are
``lowercase_snake``; agent codes are ``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE`` (asserted below). A route
handler keeps returning the wire envelope; a tool surfaces an ``AgentError``.

The registry :data:`ERROR_CODES` is **append-only** — a shipped code is a stable
surface an agent (and its saved prompts/SOPs) branch on, so it is never removed or
reworded once released (``tests/test_error_codes_append_only.py`` enforces it).
New failure paths add a code; they never repurpose one.
