"""RFC 6238 TOTP, on the standard library (REMOTE-USER-AUTH T4.2 primitives).

No `pyotp`. TOTP is an HMAC-SHA1 over a counter and a truncation — about fifteen lines of
`hmac` and `base64` — so a dependency here would buy nothing and add a supply-chain edge to
the credential path, which is the last place to want one. This is the deliberate exception
to "don't hand-roll crypto": we are not inventing a construction, we are calling
`hmac.new()` exactly as the RFC specifies, and the test vectors in RFC 6238 Appendix B pin
it. (Password hashing is the opposite case, and gets `argon2-cffi`.)

The verify accepts the adjacent time steps, because a phone whose clock is a few seconds
off is normal and a user who cannot log in because of it will simply turn 2FA off.
