"""Single-use device enrollment codes (REMOTE-USER-AUTH C3 / T4.3).

The problem this solves: you are holding a phone, off your home network, and you want it to
have a durable session. Typing a long password into a phone keyboard over a tunnel is both
unpleasant and the worst place to expose the credential — phone keyboards autocomplete, screens
are shoulder-surfable, and the password is the one secret that must not be spent casually.

So: mint a short code **locally** (`gideon auth enroll`, which requires being at the box
or already authenticated), read it off the screen, type it into the phone once. The code is
worth exactly one session and nothing else.

**Every property here exists to bound the blast radius of an 8-character string:**

* **single-use** — redeemed codes are removed before the session is minted, so a race cannot
  redeem twice;
* **short-lived** — 300s, per the plan. A code that lingers is a password with a shorter
  alphabet;
* **rate-limited by scarcity** — at most `_MAX_ACTIVE` outstanding at once, so an attacker
  cannot ask for thousands and widen the guess space;
* **hashed at rest** — the file stores a SHA-256 of the code, so reading `enroll_codes.json`
  does not yield a redeemable credential;
* **constant-time compared**, and **fail-closed** on an unreadable store.

Codes live in their own 0600 file rather than in `sessions.json`: they are not sessions, and
mixing a pre-auth artifact into the post-auth store is how one bug becomes two.
