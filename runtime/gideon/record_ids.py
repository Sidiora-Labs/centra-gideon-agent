"""The ONE resolver from an untrusted record id to a path inside its store.

**Why this module exists.** Every JSON-file store in Gideon named its records
by concatenating an id into a directory: ``_dir() / f"{record_id}.json"``. Thirty-odd
sites did it, each with its own idea of whether the id had been checked, and four were
reachable from a route parameter with no check at all. Because ``pathlib``'s ``/``
**discards the left operand when the right side is absolute**, that expression is not
a join — it is an unbounded filesystem address::

    base / "p-abc"        → /…/projects/p-abc
    base / "/tmp/zz56"    → /tmp/zz56              ← base discarded
    base / "../../../tmp" → /…/projects/../../../tmp

Measured consequences, all reproduced against live routes: ``DELETE /api/projects``
``shutil.rmtree``-ing an arbitrary directory (#455), ``GET``/``DELETE /api/tasks/{id}``
reading and unlinking any ``.json`` on the disk (#471), and the same read+unlink pair
through the learning and skill proposal stores (#459). One class, four proven doors.

**The containment lives in the store, not the route.** A check in the handler layer
would leave the MCP tools, the workflow action providers and the CLI as unguarded doors
to the same stores — the reasoning ``artifacts/native.py`` already records for its own
guard. :func:`record_path` is therefore called by the path builder every store already
has, so a new caller of that store inherits the guard instead of having to remember it.

**:class:`UnsafeRecordId` is deliberately NOT a ``ValueError``.** The stores swallow
``(OSError, ValueError, TypeError)`` — or bare ``Exception`` — around their reads and
return ``None``, which is how this class survived: a traversal attempt answered ``404``
and was indistinguishable from a missing record, so probes recorded "this store
validates its ids" when it did not (#459 documents nearly missing it for exactly this
reason). A refusal that reads as *absence* is a refusal nobody can audit. Basing the
error on ``Exception`` directly means those enumerated ``except`` clauses do not catch
it and the refusal propagates to the caller, which maps it to a ``400``. Do not
"tidy" it under ``ValueError``.

**What a safe id is.** Exactly one path segment: non-empty, within
:data:`MAX_RECORD_ID_LEN`, no path separator (either platform's), no ``.``/``..``
segment, no NUL, and not absolute. That is a deliberately *narrower* rule than
"resolves inside the root" — a resolved-containment check alone still accepts
``sub/dir/id``, which silently invents a subdirectory layout no store reads back.
Containment is then asserted anyway, as defense in depth, because the shape rule is a
statement about ids and the containment is a statement about the filesystem, and only
the second one is still true after a symlink.
