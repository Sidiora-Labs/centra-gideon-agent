"""Optional-SDK import guard (plan 34 T1.4).

Provider adapters for hosted vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic) import their SDK
*lazily* so that a bare ``pip install gideon`` stays lean — the SDKs are
demoted to the ``[openai]`` / ``[anthropic]`` extras and also ship via the
branded provider apps' manifest ``pythonDependencies``. When such an adapter is
actually constructed/used without its SDK present, the raw
``ModuleNotFoundError`` is unhelpful; ``require_sdk`` replaces it with a
``MissingSDKError`` that names the exact remedy and the doctor hint.
