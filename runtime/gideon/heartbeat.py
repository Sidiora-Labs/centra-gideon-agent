"""Heartbeat service — periodic background tasks.

Runs on a configurable interval (default 60s):
- Reads HEARTBEAT.md for pending tasks → sends to agent
- Idle-session consolidation, background compression, session reindex, auto-archive,
  due-commitment delivery — the user-facing behaviors §4.4 explicitly KEEPS here.

**Store maintenance is not here at all (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §4.4, PR2-8).** Memory FTS
reconciliation, the history and SEL prunes and skill-library aging belong to the
health-scored remediation engine, which is driven by ONE adaptive-clock trigger
(``system:self-remediation``) and not by this loop. Both the engine's driver
(``_maybe_remediate``, with its private ``_remediation_next_ts`` scheduler) and the
duplicate per-tick copies of those four passes (``_legacy_maintenance``) were DELETED with
that re-homing: one implementation of each pass, on one cadence, with no config flag
switching between two of them.
