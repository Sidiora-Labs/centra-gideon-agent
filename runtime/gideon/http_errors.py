"""The ONE wire error emitter, and the append-only registry of wire codes.

`AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" → **Error envelope (HTTP)** owns this shape:
a failed API route answers ``{"error": {"code": "<stable_snake_code>", "message":
"<human>"}}``, and ``code`` is *append-only and never reworded once shipped* — a
stable surface an agent (or a saved SOP, or a browser client) branches on.

**Why this module exists.** The declaration above shipped long before anything
could check it: thirteen module-local ``_err``/``_error``/``_bad_request``
helpers each re-derived the envelope, four of them emitted a *flat*
``{"error": "<prose>"}`` carrying no code at all, and their signatures disagreed
in argument ORDER (``_err(code, message, status)``, ``_err(message, code,
status)`` and ``_err(code, status)`` all shipped), so a copy-paste between two
handlers silently swapped the machine code and the human message. There was also
no registry of wire codes and no rail, so "append-only" was unverifiable.
:func:`json_error` is the single emitter that replaced all thirteen, and
:data:`HTTP_ERROR_CODES` is the registry the rail
(``tests/test_http_error_codes_append_only.py``) checks.

**No positional ambiguity, by construction.** ``code`` is the ONLY positional
parameter. ``message``, ``status`` and everything else are keyword-only, so the
copy-paste hazard that motivated this module cannot recur: there is no second
positional slot for a code and a message to swap between.

**Two envelopes, deliberately distinct — do not merge them.** This module owns
the *wire* envelope (``lowercase_snake`` codes; what a branching HTTP client
reads). :mod:`gideon.errors` owns :class:`~gideon.errors.AgentError`
(``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE`` codes; the carrier *into an LLM session*, on
``ToolResult``/``ActionResult``). The two vocabularies never overlap by
construction — the case of the code tells you which surface you are on — and the
rails on both registries assert that disjointness. A third, transport-independent
vocabulary (``WF_UPPER_SNAKE``, the workflows *service-result* codes) is
translated into this one by ``workflows/handlers.py``'s ``_STATUS_MAP``; it is not
a wire vocabulary and does not belong here.

**Success envelopes are out of scope.** The same convention says success bodies
imitate the neighboring handler and are *not* standardized retroactively.

# ── The append-only wire-code registry ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# code → one-line meaning. This is the peer of :data:`gideon.errors.ERROR_CODES`
# for the HTTP surface, and it obeys the same rule: APPEND a row for a new failure
# path; never delete or reword a released one (a saved SOP or a browser client may
# branch on it). ``tests/test_http_error_codes_append_only.py`` enforces that, and
# also asserts that every *literal* code passed to :func:`json_error` appears here —
# so the registry cannot quietly fall behind the emitter.
#
# The meaning doubles as the default ``message`` when a call site has no
# per-instance detail to add (the auth/device-pairing routes, which deliberately
# answer with a fixed string per code so the response cannot be used to enumerate
# users or devices).
