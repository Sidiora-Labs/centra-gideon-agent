"""Model use-case truth store — the single source of which model serves a capability.

There is ONE store: ``~/.gideon/active_models.json``. It maps a use case to
the active model reference(s), each ``"<provider_name>:<model_id>"`` where
``provider_name`` is a configured provider (config.json ``providers[]`` /
``default_registry``) or a bundled in-process provider. Every consumer — chat,
embedding, and (via the typed registries) stt/tts — reads selections from here, so
the Settings → Models picker and what the runtime resolves never disagree.

Use cases are two-grain:

* **Capabilities** (top grain) — ``chat``, ``embedding``, ``stt``, ``tts`` and the
  modality / generation kinds. A capability always has its own active model.
* **Chat sub-categories** — ``reasoning``, ``code_tools``: finer roles *within*
  chat. A user MAY pin a distinct model to one; when they don't, resolution falls
  back to the parent capability's model (:func:`parent_capability`). They are never
  their own capability — they borrow chat's pool.

Per-use-case *behavior* settings (provider-agnostic — e.g. auto-speak for tts,
language for stt) live separately in
``~/.gideon/extensions/use_case_settings/{use_case}.json``.

#   image_modality  — understands images (a.k.a. vision)
