"""Provider Bridge — resolves a use case to a live ModelProvider instance.

The model is:

1. Read the active selection for the use case from ``active_models.json``
   (Settings → Models) — a ``"<provider_name>:<model_id>"`` ref.
2. Resolve that provider from the config.json ``providers[]`` registry

3. Fall back to the first configured provider declaring the capability when no
   model is selected.

The bridge exports a single function ``create_provider_factory()`` that returns
