"""One-click 'create a profile from my current voice' migration (MULTIMODAL-IO §6).

Voice today is a flat ``provider:voice`` selection in ``active_models.json`` plus the
behavioral ``tts`` use-case settings (speed, persona). This promotes that flat
selection into a first-class :class:`~gideon.voice.profiles.VoiceProfile` of the
``design`` kind and binds it as the ``default`` surface, so the user's current voice
becomes an editable profile without changing what they hear.

Two rules are deliberate:

* **Captured from the FLAT selection, never the resolved chain.** The source is
  :func:`~gideon.tts.registry.active_tts` (the ``active_models.json`` ref) plus the
  ``tts`` behavioral settings — NOT :func:`~gideon.tts.registry.active_voice_params`,
  which would walk any existing profile binding and migrate an already-migrated profile
  back onto itself. A design kind carries no reference clip, so this never fabricates
  consent-bearing provenance.
* **Never automatic.** There is no caller on a startup/first-run path; the only trigger
  is the explicit ``POST /api/voice/migrate`` a user's click makes. The zero-profile
  fallback (§1/§6) already reproduces today's output, so nothing here runs on its own.
