"""Voice-loop helpers shared by the STT and TTS surfaces.

``duplex`` holds the pure decision functions for the hands-free (duplex) loop:
confirmation/exit gating, TTS-echo detection, and pre-speech text cleaning.
Nothing in here performs I/O or touches a model — the endpoints in
``dashboard/`` own that and call these to decide.
