#:
#: 🔴 These were known to be secret in exactly one place and unknown here (#643).
#: ``handlers/files.py`` refuses every one of them, so ``/api/file-read`` answered
#: ``400 invalid or forbidden path`` — while this function, which the terminal cwd guard,
#: the bash read/write hooks and the action denylist all consult, returned False for all
#: of them. Measured against the shipped guard: only ``~/.gideon/.env`` was blocked;
#: ``sel_hmac.key``, ``.local_secret``, ``telemetry_salt`` and ``credentials/`` were not.
#:
#: What each one costs:
#:   ``sel_hmac.key``   signs the append-only security log. With it, log rows can be forged
#:                      and the chain still verifies — the one record that cannot be repaired.
#:   ``.local_secret``  the loopback auth rail (``auth/cli.py``, ``mcp_core``, ``mcp_shared``).
#:   ``telemetry_salt`` de-anonymizes recorded telemetry.
#:
#: BASENAME rather than a path, deliberately: ``GIDEON_HOME`` is user-settable, so
#: these files are not confined to one directory and a home-relative entry cannot follow
#: them. These three names are unique to Gideon, so no realistic file elsewhere
#: legitimately carries one — unlike a suffix rule (``.key``/``.pem``), which would refuse a
#: project's own public certificate. ``files.py`` keeps that stricter suffix tier, scoped to
#: the dashboard's allowlisted roots where it belongs.
#:
#: ``session_key`` and ``sessions.json`` are deliberately NOT here — see
#: ``_SENSITIVE_GIDEON_HOME_ENTRIES``. The split is by a real property (is the name ours
#: alone?), not by which module happened to define it, which is what let the two lists

#: every user override, the governance ceiling was agent-writable, which is precisely the
#: "a bound the agent can rewrite is not a bound" the entry above exists to prevent.
#:
#: The home itself is NOT listed: it is a browsable dashboard root holding the knowledge
#: DB, apps and logs, so refusing it wholesale would break the files area. Only the
#: secret-bearing entries are refused.
#:
#: ``session_key`` and ``sessions.json`` live here rather than in
#: :data:`OWN_SECRET_BASENAMES` because they are secret by LOCATION, not by name: a user's
#: own project may reasonably hold a ``sessions.json``, and blocking that name everywhere
#: would make the agent's bash guard refuse an ordinary file. Reading OURS forges a session

# userinfo slot of a URL, matches neither — so `https://user:s3cr3t@github.com/a/b.git` survived
# every surface in this tree that "redacts" (#406): the diagnostics log stream, the SEL audit
# `resources` field, agent output, and the ConfirmationRequest preview.

# Measured before writing this:
#
#   https://user:s3cr3t@github.com/acme/repo.git    -> unchanged        LEAK
#   git clone https://alice:hunter2@git.example…    -> unchanged        LEAK

#   https://oauth2:ghp_AAAA…@github.com/a/b.git     -> redacted        …by ACCIDENT
#
# That last row is the tell: it was caught only because the password happened to be a GitHub token
# whose SHAPE one of the patterns knows. Any other provider's secret, or any human password, went
# through untouched. A positional rule is the only thing that closes the class.
#
# **A dedicated pre-pass, not another alternative in `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS`.** That regex's matches
# are replaced whole, so folding userinfo in would swallow the scheme and host too and turn a
# diagnosable "clone of github.com/acme/repo failed" into `[REDACTED: credential]`. Removing the
# secret must not remove the ability to read the log. So only the userinfo is replaced.
#
# It runs BEFORE the shape-based pass for the same reason the accident above is bad: otherwise a
# `ghp_`-shaped password and an arbitrary one redact to visibly different text.
#
# Scope of the match, deliberately narrow:
#   * anchored on `<scheme>://`, so `alice@example.com` in prose is untouched — a bare email is not
#     a credential and redacting it would make the logs worse;
#   * userinfo cannot contain `/`, `?`, `#`, `@` or whitespace, which is what keeps an `@` inside a
#     query string or a path from being mistaken for a userinfo delimiter;
#   * a bare `token@host` with no colon matches too. That is not over-reach: it is exactly how a
#     GitHub PAT is passed in a clone URL (`https://<token>@github.com/…`), so treating userinfo as
#     secret only when it has two parts would miss the most common real case.

    Any text that entered from outside the user↔agent trust boundary — a fetched web

    prompt-injection ("ignore previous instructions, now do X"). Fencing it in
    ``<untrusted_content>`` markers (paired with the system-prompt note that the span is
    never executable) neutralises that: the model still READS the content but treats it
    as quoted data. Mirrors how Gideon already fences memory values.

    Defends against a **fence-break**: content that itself contains the close marker (a
    crafted page trying to "escape" the fence and inject trailing instructions) has its
    markers neutralised before wrapping, so the fence can't be closed early. An empty /
    whitespace-only input is returned unchanged (nothing to fence).

    Also neutralises **chat-template role tokens** (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §7/R4 rule b).
    The XML fence is a convention the model is ASKED to respect; a role token is part of
    the wire format the runtime uses to mark who is speaking, so it can forge a turn

    ``fence_untrusted`` intact. Local providers are exactly where that bites: a hosted
    API rejects or escapes stray control tokens, while a local runtime applying its own
    chat template will happily honour them.

    Carries **provenance attributes** (§7/R4 rule c): ``source_type`` (the CLASS of
    origin — ``web_watch``, ``file``, ``inbox``), ``source_id`` (which one — a url, a
    path, a message id) and ``transformation_path`` (how it got here — ``poll``,
    ``digest``, ``extract``). ``source=`` is kept and unchanged, because thirteen call
    sites pass it and it is what the existing tag-parser in ``learning/hygiene.py``
    tolerates; the three new attributes are additive and optional.

    Why all three rather than one string: "a web page said this" and "THIS page said
    this, and we summarised it on the way" are different claims, and only the second
    lets a reader (or a later audit) tell whether the text a model acted on is the text
