"""The idle runtime — what actually FIRES a `kind:idle` trigger (§1.2 / §7 step 9 — WF2AUT-11).

**🔴 MEASURED BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN.** `idle` has been a fully declared kind since S87: it is
in `models.KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS['idle']` names its three fields (`scope`, `idle_secs`,
`first_idle_secs`), and `nl_kind` gives it NL phrasings, so a user can ask for "nudge me when the
session goes quiet", have it persisted, listed by `/api/triggers` and rendered on the Automations
page — and **nothing fired it**. `dispatch.py`, `executor.py` and `firepath.py` contain no mention
of it, and `idle_secs` was read only by `autonudge.py`. The clock tick could never surface one
either: `service.due_ids` skips any trigger with no `next_fire_at`, and an idle trigger has none
because its due-ness is not a schedule — it is a *predicate over session activity*.

That is the same declared-but-unpolled shape as `file` (S93), `web_watch` (S121) and
`run_completed` (S122), and it is closed the same way: a runtime that enumerates the kind, decides
due-ness from real state, and hands a fire to the shipped dispatch→executor chain.

**Why this rides the TICK rather than a fourth poll loop.** `file` and `web_watch` each got their
own gateway loop because each polls an external world (a filesystem, the network) on its own
cadence. Idle polls nothing: the input is the session manager already in memory and a per-trigger
`last_fire`/`armed_at` stamp. `loop.tick_once` already wakes at most every
`service.MAX_SLEEP_SECS` (30s), already holds the `sessions` manager, and is already the one place
that turns a decision into a dispatch. A fifth loop would only add a second thing that can be
forgotten — which is exactly the defect this module exists to close. So `tick_once` calls
`poll(...)` once per iteration, above its `if not result.fires` early return, for the same reason
the spool drain sits there: an idle session is *precisely* when an idle trigger is due, and
returning early on an empty due-set would skip it exactly then.

**🔴 HALF 2 LANDED (WF2AUT-11): `autonudge.py` is deleted and the loop tick engine rides this
runtime.** The two populations that used to coexist — user idle triggers here, loop-worker nudge
loops in autonudge's private store + timers — now live in ONE store and tick off ONE poll. The
split that remains is a ROUTING split, decided per row by one spec read (`_is_nudge`):

* **A plain idle row** (no `spec.message`) fires through the shipped wake path below —
  `wakeup.dispatch_fires` + `executor.drain` — unchanged.
* **A nudge row** (`spec.message` present) is handed to `triggers.nudge.AutoNudgeService.deliver`,
  which carries the old timer's fire body verbatim in meaning (stop-sentinel → remove;
  `max_cycles` → deactivate; delivered-only counting through this module's `record_delivery`) and
  whose `on_fire` is the gateway's loop-cycle driver, injected exactly as before. A due nudge row
  with no service to hand it to is a typed skip (`nudge_service_unavailable`), never a
  fall-through to the wake path.
* **The overlap that WOULD be possible is still refused.** A plain idle trigger scoped to a
  session some nudge loop drives is skipped with the same typed reason (`autonudge_owns_session`,
  kept verbatim for wire/test stability) — logged, never silently dropped (§7 crit 8). The fence
  is now a scan of the rows already in hand (`_nudge_owned_sessions`) rather than a probe into a
  second store, because there is no second store.

**Preserved autonudge semantics** (from the deleted `autonudge.py`'s timer body, kept verbatim
in meaning — the historical line references live in the WF2AUT-11 design note):

* **Reactive re-arm.** A fire re-arms from the fire, not from a fixed grid: `armed_at` is stamped
  to the fire instant so the next fire is `idle_secs` after *this* one settled. User activity
  re-arms too — `notify_activity` restamps `armed_at`, which is autonudge's
  `notify_user_input` cancel-and-re-arm expressed as state instead of a timer (a poll has no timer
  to cancel; moving the arm point forward is the same thing and survives a restart, which the
  timer did not).
* **Delivered-only counting.** `cycle_count` and `last_fire` advance ONLY when the dispatcher
  reports `delivered`. Autonudge's comment says why: "skipped nudges (e.g. session mid-turn)
  inflate cycle_count and prematurely trip max_cycles".
* **Mid-turn drop.** A wake for a session that is mid-turn is dropped by `wakeup.deliver`
  (`SKIPPED_RUNNING`) because that session drains its own inbox. That drop is what makes the
  delivered-only rule load-bearing rather than decorative — and because the counter does not move,
  the trigger stays armed and retries on the next tick.
* **`first_idle_secs`, one-shot, `0` = disabled.** A freshly-created idle trigger may fire after a
  shorter first wait so it starts promptly instead of sitting for the full `idle_secs`; the short
  wait applies only while `cycle_count == 0` and is spent on the first DELIVERED fire.

**State is a SIDECAR.** `config_dir()/trigger-idle/<safe-id>.json`, matching `file_poll`'s
`trigger-watch/` and the `task_leases/` convention. `armed_at`/`cycle_count` churn on every turn;
writing them onto the trigger entity would rewrite `triggers.json` constantly and race every
unrelated edit (S61d).
