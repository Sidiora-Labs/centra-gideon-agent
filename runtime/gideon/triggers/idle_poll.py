"""The idle runtime — what actually FIRES a `kind:idle` trigger (§1.2 / §7 step 9 — WF2AUT-11).

**🔴 MEASURED BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN.** `idle` has been a fully declared kind since S87: it is
in `models.KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS['idle']` names its three fields (`scope`, `idle_secs`,
`first_idle_secs`), and `nl_kind` gives it NL phrasings, so a user can ask for "nudge me when the
session goes quiet", have it persisted, listed by `/api/triggers` and rendered on the Automations
page — and **nothing fired it**. `dispatch.py`, `executor.py` and `firepath.py` contain no mention
of it, and `idle_secs` was read only by `autonudge.py`. The clock tick could never surface one
either: `service.due_ids` skips any trigger with no `next_fire_at`, and an idle trigger has none
because its due-ness is not a schedule — it is a *predicate over session activity*.

That is the same declared-but-unpolled shape as `file` (S93), `web_watch` (S121) and
`run_completed` (S122), and it is closed the same way: a runtime that enumerates the kind, decides
due-ness from real state, and hands a fire to the shipped dispatch→executor chain.

**Why this rides the TICK rather than a fourth poll loop.** `file` and `web_watch` each got their
own gateway loop because each polls an external world (a filesystem, the network) on its own
cadence. Idle polls nothing: the input is the session manager already in memory and a per-trigger
`last_fire`/`armed_at` stamp. `loop.tick_once` already wakes at most every
`service.MAX_SLEEP_SECS` (30s), already holds the `sessions` manager, and is already the one place
that turns a decision into a dispatch. A fifth loop would only add a second thing that can be
forgotten — which is exactly the defect this module exists to close. So `tick_once` calls
`poll(...)` once per iteration, above its `if not result.fires` early return, for the same reason
the spool drain sits there: an idle session is *precisely* when an idle trigger is due, and
returning early on an empty due-set would skip it exactly then.

**🔴 THIS CANNOT DOUBLE-FIRE ALONGSIDE `autonudge.py`, and the split is structural, not a
convention.** Half 2 of WF2AUT-11 (deleting `autonudge.py` so the loop tick engine rides
`kind:idle`) is blocked on LOOPS-EVOLUTION Phase 4 — there is no loop-ticker in the tree yet — so
both mechanisms are alive at once and the disjointness has to be *provable*:

* **Different stores.** An autonudge loop lives in autonudge's own `nudges` JSON store as a
  `NudgeLoop`; an idle trigger lives in `triggers.json` as a `Trigger`. Neither reads the other's
  file, so neither can enumerate the other's rows. `autonudge.AutoNudgeService` has no
  `TriggerStore` and this module has no `NudgeLoop`.
* **Different arming.** Autonudge arms an `asyncio` timer per loop from `notify_turn_complete`;
  this is a poll off the tick. Nothing bridges them.
* **And the overlap that WOULD be possible is refused.** The one way a single session could be
  nudged twice is an idle trigger whose scope names a session that also has an autonudge loop. So
  `poll` skips exactly that trigger and returns it as a SKIPPED row with a reason
  (`autonudge_owns_session`) — logged, never silently dropped (§7 crit 8). When Phase 4 lands and
  autonudge is deleted, the check finds nothing to defer to and every idle trigger fires; that is
  the migration, and it needs no flag.

**Preserved autonudge semantics** (`autonudge.py` lines 318-352, kept verbatim in meaning):

* **Reactive re-arm.** A fire re-arms from the fire, not from a fixed grid: `armed_at` is stamped
  to the fire instant so the next fire is `idle_secs` after *this* one settled. User activity
  re-arms too — `notify_activity` restamps `armed_at`, which is autonudge's
  `notify_user_input` cancel-and-re-arm expressed as state instead of a timer (a poll has no timer
  to cancel; moving the arm point forward is the same thing and survives a restart, which the
  timer did not).
* **Delivered-only counting.** `cycle_count` and `last_fire` advance ONLY when the dispatcher
  reports `delivered`. Autonudge's comment says why: "skipped nudges (e.g. session mid-turn)
  inflate cycle_count and prematurely trip max_cycles".
* **Mid-turn drop.** A wake for a session that is mid-turn is dropped by `wakeup.deliver`
  (`SKIPPED_RUNNING`) because that session drains its own inbox. That drop is what makes the
  delivered-only rule load-bearing rather than decorative — and because the counter does not move,
  the trigger stays armed and retries on the next tick.
* **`first_idle_secs`, one-shot, `0` = disabled.** A freshly-created idle trigger may fire after a
  shorter first wait so it starts promptly instead of sitting for the full `idle_secs`; the short
  wait applies only while `cycle_count == 0` and is spent on the first DELIVERED fire.

**State is a SIDECAR.** `config_dir()/trigger-idle/<safe-id>.json`, matching `file_poll`'s
`trigger-watch/` and the `task_leases/` convention. `armed_at`/`cycle_count` churn on every turn;
writing them onto the trigger entity would rewrite `triggers.json` constantly and race every
unrelated edit (S61d).
