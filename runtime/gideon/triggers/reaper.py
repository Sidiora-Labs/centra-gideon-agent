"""The trigger reaper: force-release runs that blew their deadline (§3.1 / §8 — S106).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES: the cron reaper has been INERT since S100.**
`ScheduleService._reaper_loop` sweeps `self._job_start_times`, and that dict has exactly ONE writer
in the whole codebase — `_run_job_isolated`, reachable only from `_on_timer`, i.e. only from the
legacy timer the clock cutover stopped arming. Driven directly (a service with a genuinely hung task
in `_executing` + `_running_tasks`, the reaper interval cut to 50ms, eight sweeps):

    job still in _executing : True
    task still running      : True
    sessions.reset called   : []
    reaped_jobs             : set()

Nothing was reaped, nothing could be. `start_reaper()` still returned successfully and still logged
nothing wrong, so the 30-minute deadline the plan calls "defense-in-depth over ALL trigger-fired
runs" (§ "Unattended LLM turns", risk table "hung run") was a control that was present, reviewed,
and enforcing nothing — the exact failure class this program keeps finding.

**Why a new module instead of repairing the old loop.** The state the old reaper needs
(`_job_start_times`, `_job_jitter`, `_reaped_jobs`, `_active_session_keys`) is all process-local, so
it could only ever describe runs THIS process started through the retired timer. The store-backed
fire path already keeps the same fact durably and cross-process: S97's **claim** carries
`trigger_id`, `holder`, and `claimed_at`, is written by the tick when a fire is granted, and is
released by the executor's `finally`. So "which runs are in flight, and since when" is answerable
from disk, correctly, after a restart and from any process. Reaping reads that instead.

**What reaping means here, and what it deliberately does NOT mean.** Two things bound a run:

* the CLAIM, which gates the next fire — a stuck claim wedges its trigger until the 1h self-expiry,
  so the reaper releases it and records the outcome; and
* the PROCESS, which is bounded by whoever owns it. `run-prompt`/`invoke-agent` fires are
  fire-and-forget `SubagentManager.spawn` calls, and that manager runs its own live reaper with the
  same 30min/60s/SIGKILL parameters over `_agents` (verified: `spawn` registers the entry and boot
  calls `start_reaper()` unconditionally). Killing a session from here as well would mean two
  reapers racing over one process — so this one owns the claim and lets the subagent reaper own the
  process. That is a narrower job than the cron reaper *claimed* to do, and strictly more than it
  actually did.

The sweep is therefore: read every live claim, and for each one older than its deadline, release the
claim, mark the trigger's health, and write a `timeout` ledger row so the run shows up in history as
reaped rather than as still-running-forever.
