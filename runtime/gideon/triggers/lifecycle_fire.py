"""Firing the dormant lifecycle events (AUTO §7 criterion 5 — S82).

Criterion 5 has two clauses. S67 closed the first (event-kind API parity). This is the second:
"**the 8 dormant lifecycle events actually fire**".

**Measured before writing.** `triggers.events.configurable_but_dead()` reports seven events —
`ApprovalRequest`, `ContextCompact`, `MemoryWrite`, `PostResponse`, `PreResponse`, `SessionEnd`,
`SubagentSpawn` — and a grep for each name outside its own declaration finds exactly ONE hit: the
`validation.py` allowlist. They are selectable in the hook UI, they validate, they save, and nothing
ever calls them. A user can configure one and wait forever.

(The plan says "8"; the eighth was `TaskComplete`, which S61e/S61f wired — `dormant_events()` now
returns seven. The count in the criterion predates that session.)

**The payload shape is the existing one, deliberately.** `workflows/pool.lifecycle_payload` already
established that a lifecycle fire passes `event` + a `context` string rather than inventing hook
variables, because the hook UI renders a FIXED `vars` tuple per event and a variable the UI does not
list is one no user can discover. Each builder returns that same two-key dict, and a test asserts
every builder's `event` is a name the catalog declares — so a typo becomes a red test rather than an
event nobody receives.

**An observer never fails the thing it observed.** Every fire is wrapped: a broken hook script must
not turn a successful memory write into an exception, and the write has already happened by the time
the hook runs. That is the rule `tasks/native.py` set for `TaskComplete`, applied to seven sites.

**Two of the seven fire from SYNC code** (`MemoryService.write_lesson`, `SubagentManager.spawn`)
while `ScriptHookStore.fire` is a coroutine. `fire_sync` bridges that by scheduling onto the running
loop when there is one and skipping otherwise — measured rather than assumed, see its docstring.
