"""The web_watch poll runtime — what actually FIRES a `web_watch` trigger (§7 item 8 — S121).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.** `web_watch` is a declared kind: it is in `KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS` accepts
`{url, poll_interval, extraction, novelty_key}`, `nl_kind.route()` routes any URL to it, the store
persists it, `/api/triggers` lists it (S94) and the Automations page renders it (S95). Nothing polls
it. Measured before writing a line:

    T.create(store, name="watch pypi", when="watch https://pypi.org/... for changes")
      → ok: True   "Created automation 'watch pypi' (web_watch:watch-pypi), kind web_watch."

    tick()                       → considered: none      (no `next_fire_at`; not a clock kind)
    file_poll.file_triggers()    → ['file:t']            (only `file`)

So a user could ask for exactly what the plan advertises, be told it worked, see it in the UI — and
it would never fire. Same shape as S93's file-watch gap, one kind over: present, listable, inert.

**The seen-set IS the storm guard**, in §3's own words. A page that changes on every fetch (a
timestamp, a rotating ad, a CSRF token) must not produce a fire per poll. So novelty is keyed on
EXTRACTED ITEMS, not on the raw body: a body hash would treat any byte change as news, which is the
failure mode that turns one watch into a notification every minute.

**Fetching goes through `net.fetch`** — the egress chokepoint — never `urllib`/`httpx` directly.
That applies host classification, private-IP denial, the redirect-hop re-check, the byte cap and
the timeout. A watch pointed at `http://169.254.169.254/` is an SSRF against the machine's own
metadata service, and the chokepoint is where that is already refused; re-implementing a fetch here
would bypass every one of those controls.

**A daily request budget, enforced.** §3 asks for one, and without it a `poll_interval` of 60 on a
handful of watches is a few thousand requests a day at someone else's server. The budget is counted
in the sidecar and refuses with a ledger-visible reason rather than silently skipping.

**State is a SIDECAR**, matching `file_poll`'s reasoning exactly: a seen-set is high-churn runtime
state, and writing it onto the trigger entity would rewrite `triggers.json` on every poll and race
every unrelated edit.

**What this does NOT own:** the LLM turn (the executor, injected as a runner by the gateway), item
extraction beyond the two shipped strategies, and the headless-browser escalation tier §3 mentions —
that needs a browser runtime this repo does not have, and a stub would be an inert control.
