"""The web_watch poll runtime — what actually FIRES a `web_watch` trigger (§7 item 8 — S121).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.** `web_watch` is a declared kind: it is in `KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS` accepts
`{url, poll_interval, extraction, novelty_key}`, `nl_kind.route()` routes any URL to it, the store
persists it, `/api/triggers` lists it (S94) and the Automations page renders it (S95). Nothing polls
it. Measured before writing a line:

    T.create(store, name="watch pypi", when="watch https://pypi.org/... for changes")
      → ok: True   "Created automation 'watch pypi' (web_watch:watch-pypi), kind web_watch."

    tick()                       → considered: none      (no `next_fire_at`; not a clock kind)
    file_poll.file_triggers()    → ['file:t']            (only `file`)

So a user could ask for exactly what the plan advertises, be told it worked, see it in the UI — and
it would never fire. Same shape as S93's file-watch gap, one kind over: present, listable, inert.

**The seen-set IS the storm guard**, in §3's own words. A page that changes on every fetch (a
timestamp, a rotating ad, a CSRF token) must not produce a fire per poll. So novelty is keyed on
EXTRACTED ITEMS, not on the raw body: a body hash would treat any byte change as news, which is the
failure mode that turns one watch into a notification every minute.

**Fetching goes through the egress chokepoint** — never `urllib`/`httpx` directly. The plain tier is
`net.fetch`; the opt-in headless tier is `web.render.render_url`. BOTH apply host classification,
private-IP denial and the redirect-hop re-check (`render_url` runs `net.guard.evaluate` before it
navigates, precisely because a browser does its own DNS and would otherwise bypass the pin). A watch
pointed at `http://169.254.169.254/` is an SSRF against the machine's own metadata service, and both
tiers refuse it; re-implementing a fetch here would bypass every one of those controls.

**A daily request budget, enforced.** §3 asks for one, and without it a `poll_interval` of 60 on a
handful of watches is a few thousand requests a day at someone else's server. The budget is counted
in the sidecar and refuses with a ledger-visible reason rather than silently skipping.

**State is a SIDECAR**, matching `file_poll`'s reasoning exactly: a seen-set is high-churn runtime
state, and writing it onto the trigger entity would rewrite `triggers.json` on every poll and race
every unrelated edit.

**The headless-browser escalation tier IS built** (§3). A page that answers 200 with an empty JS
shell defeats the plain fetch — `extract_items` finds nothing on a real success, the escalation
signal. When a watch opts in (`escalate_headless: true`, default OFF so existing watches are
byte-unchanged), the poll escalates to `render_url`, which drives a headless Chromium through the
SAME egress guard and returns post-JS HTML for the shared extractor. A render is far costlier than a
fetch, so escalations spend their own bounded budget (`max_headless_requests`), accounted win-or-
lose and refused with a ledger-visible reason. When Playwright is absent `render_url` reports
`unavailable` and the poll serves the plain result rather than crashing.

**Fresh items land in the knowledge store as user items** — searchable bookmarks, not memory. The
seen-set still gates "new", so only genuinely-new items are written, and the write is injectable so
tests never touch the real store.

**What this does NOT own:** the LLM turn (the executor, injected as a runner by the gateway) and
item extraction beyond the two shipped strategies.
