"""Write-back routing — a provider-served row reschedules into the store that served it (TSE-5).

TSE-4 built the read half of the ``trigger`` provider seam and stopped, deliberately, at a named
gap: a registered store's rows were LISTED but never ARMED, because the arm path PERSISTS.
``service.tick`` writes ``next_fire_at``, ``run_count`` and the health rollup back with
``store.upsert(...)``, and ``store`` there was the native one. So arming a provider's row had
exactly two possible outcomes, both bad:

* **Duplicate identity** — the reschedule lands in ``triggers.json``, so one trigger id now lives
  in two stores. Worse than untidy: the native copy then WINS every later read (see
  :meth:`RoutingTriggerStore.load`), so the team's row silently forks into a local one and the
  shared file stops describing what actually runs.
* **Fire storm** — the reschedule lands nowhere, so ``next_fire_at`` stays in the past and the row
  is due again on the very next tick, forever. Not a missed fire: an unbounded one.

This module closes both. Two pieces, and the split is the design:

1. :func:`route_upsert` / :func:`route_delete` — the WRITE decision, called from
   :class:`gideon.triggers.store.TriggerStore`'s own ``upsert``/``delete``. It lives there
   rather than at the arm sites because the arm path is not the only writer: the gateway's fire-
   outcome recorder, the failure-dedup path and the autopause path each construct their OWN
   ``TriggerStore`` and write a fired row back through it. Routing at seven arm sites would have
   left every one of those minting the duplicate id this exists to prevent. Funnelling through the
   native store's write path means there is no second spelling of "persist a trigger" to forget.
2. :class:`RoutingTriggerStore` — the READ merge, substituted for the store in ``tick`` and ``boot``
   so a provider's rows reach :func:`gideon.triggers.provider.armable` at all.

**Every routed write is verified.** The serving store is re-read and the storm-relevant field
(``next_fire_at``) compared against what was asked for. A provider whose write raised, vanished or
silently did not land is **quarantined** for the rest of the process: its rows stop being armed
(they still render, and the log says why), so a store that cannot persist a schedule costs at most
ONE extra fire instead of one per tick forever.

**Scope, stated rather than implied.** ``tick`` and ``boot`` — the clock path — merge provider rows.
The ``file``/``idle``/``web_watch``/``view`` poll loops still read the bare native store, so their
provider-served rows render without arming. That is TSE-4's position, narrowed from "every provider
row" to "provider rows of a polled kind". Their
dispatch is the gateway's, and giving them a routed row without routing that dispatch would be the
duplicate-identity write again, one layer out.
