"""`TriggerService` — the one scheduler's TICK (§3 / §3.1 — S88).

§3: "One asyncio loop — **the existing single re-armed `_arm_timer` task generalized** … The task
computes the earliest `next_fire_at` across all clock/idle triggers and sleeps until it
(capped at 30s
for external-edit pickup via mtime `_sync`), coalescing same-second firings so N triggers
replacing one
60s heartbeat don't wake the laptop N times."

**Why this is buildable now.** S83 and S86 recorded "the store and the service are one unbuilt
foundation"; S87 showed that was half wrong (the service needs the store, not the reverse) and
shipped
`triggers.json`. With the store in place every dependency this file needs is present and was
verified
importable before a line was written: `store.TriggerStore`, `firepath.evaluate` (S86's gate order),
`scheduling.{is_due,boot_recovery,coalesce_wakes,next_wake_delay,recompute_from_completion,revalidate}`,
`missed.{review_at_boot,catch_up_plan,roll_forward}`, `dispatch.drain_spool`,
`delivery.build_delivery`
and `autopause.needs_attention`.

**What this owns, and the boundary.**

It owns the DECISIONS a tick makes: what is due, what a boot recovers, how wakes coalesce,
when the next
wake is, and — for each due trigger — walking S86's fire path and recording the typed ledger
row. It is
`async` and side-effect-free apart from the store writes it is explicitly asked to make.

It does NOT own EXECUTION. §3.2 is explicit that "the scheduler never executes directly": a
fired trigger
enqueues onto the target session's inbox plus a wakeup signal, and a **WakeupDispatcher**
claims and drives
runs. That dispatcher needs the session inbox seam, which is a different subsystem. So
`tick()` returns the
list of fires that PASSED every gate, and the caller dispatches. A service that both decided
and executed
would make the two untestable together — and §3.2's whole point is that crash-safety comes from the
payload surviving in the inbox, which is only true if deciding and running are separate.

**Three properties the tick has to get right, each measured rather than assumed:**

**Persist-before-execute (§3.1).** `next_fire_at` is persisted BEFORE the fire is handed out,
so a crash
mid-fire cannot double-fire. The alternative — recompute-on-poll — re-derives the same due
time after a
crash and fires again.

**Recompute from COMPLETION, anchored to `created_at` (§3.1).** Not from the missed slot: a run that
overruns its interval would otherwise produce a fire storm catching up. And anchored to the
creation grid,
so a recompute does not silently re-phase a 9am job to "whenever the last run finished".

**Boot stagger (§3.1).** Overdue fires are pushed and deterministically staggered, so a
restart does not
fire every automation in the same second.

    with a reason — zero silent drops"*, and `tick` builds exactly that row for every
    evaluated trigger. It then returns it, and **no caller persisted it**:
    `TickResult.ledger_rows` has no consumer outside this module, so `loop.tick_once`'s own
    comment ("`tick` already persisted each next fire and wrote a ledger row") was half true
    — the next fire was persisted, the row was not.

    Measured: six ticks of a quiet-hours trigger produced six `skipped_gate` rows in memory
    and ZERO rows in the store, so the history a user reads had no record any of it
    happened. That is indistinguishable from a scheduler that never woke, which is the
    silent drop the criterion bans.

    Follows S136's `_record_blocked_fire` shape deliberately: that session established that
    a suppressed fire earns a `ScheduleRun` row keyed by trigger id, with the typed outcome
    in `trigger` and `status`. Reusing the shape means the runs feed projects these exactly
    as it already projects a blocked one, instead of needing a second reader.

    Only SUPPRESSIONS. A granted fire's row is written by `gateway._record_fire_outcome`
    once the run settles; writing one here too would double-count every success in
    `count_since` — the rate meter S152 built, which reads this very store.

    Mutates the passed `triggers` list in place as well as the store, because the caller has already
