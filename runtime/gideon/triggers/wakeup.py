"""The WakeupDispatcher — inbox + wakeup, with `wake`/`resume` drop semantics (§3.2 — S89).

§3.2: "The scheduler never executes directly. A fired trigger enqueues a typed payload onto
the target
session's inbox queue + a wakeup signal; a **WakeupDispatcher** claims and drives runs. Two
wakeup kinds
with different drop semantics: **wake** — drain inbox; skipped entirely if the session is
already running
… **resume** — a gate-answer/HITL result for a parked run; **must re-queue until the parked lock
releases** — overlap guards must never eat gate answers intended for parked runs."

S88's `tick()` returns fires and deliberately does not run them. This is what receives them.

**🔴 TWO HAZARDS MEASURED IN THE SHIPPED `enqueue`, before a line of this was written.**

1. **`enqueue` DROPS the payload for an idle session.** It returns False and appends nothing unless
   `session.semaphore.locked()` or `force=True`. Driven: an idle session's queue stayed at
   length 0. For a
   3am cron that is the normal case — the session is idle precisely because nobody is using
   the machine —
   so a naive enqueue would silently lose exactly the fires this subsystem exists to deliver. Every
   enqueue here passes `force=True`, which is what the flag was added for ("covers the startup
   race where
   a task exists but hasn't acquired the lock").
2. **`enqueue` returns False when the session does not exist at all**, which is also the
normal case for a
   trigger whose session has never been opened. So a delivery that cannot be queued is
   reported, never
   assumed: `deliver()` returns a typed result and the caller decides whether to create the
   session or
   spool the payload.

Neither is a bug in `enqueue` — it was written for mid-turn chat nudges, where "the session is
idle so
just run it" is correct. It is the wrong default for a trigger fire, and the difference is invisible
unless you drive it.

**The two wakeup kinds, and why their drop semantics differ.**

* `wake` is **droppable**. It means "there is work in the inbox"; if the session is already
  running it will
  drain the queue on its own, so a second wake is noise. That is §3.2's "natural implementation of
  `overlap: skip`".
* `resume` is **never droppable**. It carries a gate ANSWER for a parked run. Dropping one
  because the
  session looks busy would strand the run forever waiting for a reply that was thrown away —
  §3.2 calls
  this out as what makes R11 resume-targets and R13 approvals safe. So a resume that cannot be
  delivered
  is REQUEUED, and `dispatch.droppable()` is the shipped predicate that decides.

**Crash-safety falls out** (§3.2): the payload lives in the inbox, so an executor crash loses
the run, not
the request. This module never executes; it queues, signals, and reports. One code path serves every
trigger kind.
