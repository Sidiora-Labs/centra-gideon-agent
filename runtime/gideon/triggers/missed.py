"""Missed fires: review, don't lie, don't storm (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.4 — S65).

Local-first means a closed lid stops the loop. So the honest question after a restart is not "what
should have run" but "what do I tell the user about what didn't". Three answers this module makes
different, because collapsing any two of them produces a specific bad outcome:

* **Enumerate, bounded.** A machine down for a week with a minutely trigger missed 10,080 slots.
  Enumerating them all is an unusable page and a slow boot; enumerating
  none is the system lying about
  what happened. So: the newest N per trigger become reviewable rows, and everything older collapses
  into ONE summary per trigger that still says how many.
* **Review, don't auto-run.** A missed fire is a decision the user should make — "run the 3am backup
  now, at 9am" is sometimes right and sometimes exactly wrong. Run-now records `ran_late`; dismiss
  records `skipped_missed`. Both are ledger rows, because §1.3 bans
  silent drops and a dismissed card
  that left no trace is a silent drop with a UI.
* **`catch_up` fires ONCE, staggered.** launchd's RunAtLoad semantics. The storm guard is the
  once-per-trigger cap plus the same deterministic per-id stagger the
  scheduler already uses — without
  both, a laptop opening after a weekend runs every automation it owns simultaneously.

`next_fire_at` rolls forward as part of enumeration, so re-opening the
page does not re-enumerate the
same misses. Pure functions over records; the boot sequence that calls them is the service.
