"""Missed fires: review, don't lie, don't storm (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.4 — S65).

Local-first means a closed lid stops the loop. So the honest question after a restart is not "what
should have run" but "what do I tell the user about what didn't". Three answers this module makes
different, because collapsing any two of them produces a specific bad outcome:

* **Enumerate, bounded.** A machine down for a week with a minutely trigger missed 10,080 slots.
  Enumerating them all is an unusable page and a slow boot; enumerating
  none is the system lying about
  what happened. So: the newest N per trigger become reviewable rows, and everything older collapses
  into ONE summary per trigger that still says how many.
* **Review, don't auto-run.** A missed fire is a decision the user should make — "run the 3am backup
  now, at 9am" is sometimes right and sometimes exactly wrong. Run-now records `ran_late`; dismiss
  records `skipped_missed`. Both are ledger rows, because §1.3 bans
  silent drops and a dismissed card
  that left no trace is a silent drop with a UI.
* **`catch_up` fires ONCE, staggered.** launchd's RunAtLoad semantics. The storm guard is the
  once-per-trigger cap plus the same deterministic per-id stagger the
  scheduler already uses — without
  both, a laptop opening after a weekend runs every automation it owns simultaneously.

`next_fire_at` rolls forward as part of enumeration, so re-opening the
page does not re-enumerate the
same misses. Pure functions over records; the boot sequence that calls them is the service.

    `Trigger.to_dict()` emits **NONE OF THE FOUR** — measured, all four `in d` are False. So the
    guard `if interval_secs <= 0 or last_fire_at <= 0` saw `0.0` and `0.0` for every trigger on
    every machine, and `review_at_boot` returned an EMPTY review no matter how long the lid was
    shut. `catch_up_plan` failed the same way one clause further on: `missed_last_slot` was absent,
    so every trigger got `"nothing was missed"` including ones overdue by hours.

    A prose spec read by nothing is inert; a spec read with the WRONG KEYS is worse, because it
    reports a confident, wrong answer. Same shape as S130's classifier disagreeing with the gate
    names the engine walks — the logic was right and the vocabulary was not.

    Derived rather than added as four persisted fields, deliberately:

    * `interval_secs` lives in `spec` (the store's shape for an interval clock) — copying it to a
      top-level column would give one value two homes and one of them would go stale.
    * `last_fire_at` has NO persisted equivalent, and inventing one would be a second write on the
      fire path. `next_fire_at - interval_secs` is the last slot the schedule OWNS, which is exactly
      the grid anchor `enumerate_missed` walks from. `last_success_at` would be wrong: a trigger
      that failed at 03:00 still missed the 04:00 slot.
    * `missed_last_slot` is a QUESTION about the row (is the armed fire in the past?), not a state
      to persist and keep in sync.

    time and took 40 minutes."* `FireRecord` carries both stamps and `validate_record` even
    refuses a `ran_late` row without a `scheduled_for` — yet only the MANUAL missed-fire
    card (`resolve_missed`) ever wrote the value. Measured: a minutely trigger fired 40
    minutes past its slot recorded a plain `ran`, with the lateness computable on that very
    row.

    The threshold is `scheduling.LATE_THRESHOLD_SECS`, DERIVED from the scheduler's own
    designed delays rather than picked: a wake can be a poll ceiling behind, and a boot
    deliberately pushes overdue fires by the stagger base and spreads them across the
    stagger window. Labelling those as lateness would mark the substrate's own correct
    behaviour as a fault — how a signal becomes noise and then gets ignored.

    Only refines `ran`. A suppressed or failed fire keeps its own outcome: "it was late" is
    not the interesting thing about a fire that never ran, and overwriting `failed` with
    `ran_late` would lose the failure entirely.

    A missing or zero `scheduled_for` returns unchanged. With no slot to compare against
