"""`automation verify-migration` — the row-for-row diff (§7 step 2 — S91).

§7 step 2: "**Trigger store unification**: `triggers.json` + row-for-row cron migration (old
file read-only one release; `gideon automation verify-migration` diff command)." §8 names
the risk it mitigates: "Migration trust (crons are the most-loved automations) → Row-for-row
migration + read-only legacy file + verify-migration diff command".

S87 shipped the store and the migration; my own docstring there promised this command by name
and it did not exist. It is the plan's named prerequisite for the cutover, so it lands before
the cutover, not after.

**🔴 WHAT DRIVING IT AGAINST THE OWNER'S REAL STORE FOUND.** Four jobs migrate `lossless:
true` — and two of them come out **disabled**. `j-every` (a 5-minute interval) and `j-seq` (an
`agent_sequence`) were `enabled=True` in `crons.json` and land `enabled=False`.

That is NOT a bug. `migrate.convert_job` does it deliberately, and its comment is right: "A row
with notes loads DISABLED even if it was enabled, so nothing fires on a schedule the migration
could not fully interpret. The user re-enables after reading the note — the opposite default
would run a half-understood automation unattended."

But `lossless: true` alongside two silently-paused automations is a report that is technically
accurate and practically misleading. A user reading "lossless" concludes nothing needs doing;
their 5-minute automation has stopped. **That gap is precisely what this command exists to
close** — and it is why the plan put a diff command in the same breath as the migration rather
than trusting the migration's own summary.

So this module reports THREE things a `lossless` flag cannot say:

* **`paused` — rows that were live and are not.** Named individually with the note that caused
  it, because "2 need review" sends a user hunting while `j-every: legacy every has no trigger
  clock kind…` tells them what to do.
* **`missing` — rows in `crons.json` with no counterpart at all.** The one true data loss, and
  the thing a row-for-row diff exists to make impossible to miss.
* **`field_drift` — per-row field comparison.** `skip_dates` dropped fires on a holiday and
  nobody knows why; that is the quietly-losable class §1.3 keeps warning about.

Pure functions over both stores. Nothing here writes: a verify that mutated would be a
migration, and the whole point is to be safe to run before deciding.
