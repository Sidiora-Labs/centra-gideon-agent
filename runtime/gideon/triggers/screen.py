"""The pre-LLM injection screen + frozen capability set (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §4a/§7 — S69).

An unattended fire reads text nobody vetted — a webhook body, a watched file, an inbox message — and
hands it to a model that can act. Two independent controls, because either alone is insufficient:

1. **The screen** (this module's `screen()`) rejects payloads carrying injection attempts BEFORE
   any token is spent. Regex, ~0.2ms, zero cost.
2. **The frozen capability set** bounds what the run can do even if the screen misses something.
   §7's acceptance criterion is explicit that a payload "cannot cause any action outside the
   trigger's frozen capability set" — verified adversarially, not asserted.

Defence in depth is the point: a screen is a filter, not a proof, and the honest design assumes it
will be evaded.

**Measured before writing.** `vector_memory._INJECTION_PATTERNS` (14 patterns) is the only screen in
the repo, and it is private to memory writes. Probed against the plan's six OWASP groups it caught
**5 of 18** adversarial payloads — 0 of 3 on token smuggling, jailbreak, and indirect injection —
while tripping on **2 of 3 ordinary sentences** ("summarize the system prompt design doc", "act as
if the deploy already happened"). So it is wrong in BOTH directions, and reusing it would have
shipped a control that blocks real work and misses real attacks.

Both failure directions matter here and they are not symmetric:

* A **miss** admits an attack, and the capability fence is what stops it becoming an action.
* A **false positive** on ordinary text silently kills a legitimate automation. That is why the
  patterns below require an imperative/second-person frame rather than matching bare topic words:
  `system\\s*prompt` alone flags anyone who mentions the phrase.

Normalization runs FIRST, because the smuggling group exists to defeat naive matching: zero-width
characters, homoglyph digits, and base64 all carry `ignore all previous instructions` past a literal
regex. Pure functions; the caller decides what to do with a verdict.

    Distinct from `freeze_capabilities` below, which NORMALIZES a block the author supplied. This
    one DERIVES the block from the action the trigger already carries, so a writer can freeze the
    right set without asking the user to restate a choice they made by picking the action.

    Decision 7: "Every non-manual trigger carries a `capabilities` block frozen at save time …
    write-capable actions require explicit opt-in." Authoring a trigger IS the opt-in — the user
    chose that action — so this records the choice rather than asking twice. The badge on the
    Automations row is what makes it visible afterwards, and `provider_is_read_only` is what decides
    whether the row needs one.

    🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS (S116). Measured: NO writer set `capabilities` — not `tools.create`, not the
    app-cron reconciler, not the digest reconciler, not the CLI, not the API. And every one of them
    creates a WRITE-CAPABLE action (`invoke-agent`, `run-prompt`, `notification-digest`), so wiring
    the fence without freezing at save would refuse 100% of real automations on their next fire.

    Read-only actions get an EMPTY block deliberately: the fence permits them without one, and
    writing `{"providers": ["notify"]}` would imply an opt-in the user never had to make — which
    matters the day someone edits that trigger's action to something write-capable and the stale
    block silently grants it.

    Existing rows are never rewritten here. A trigger authored before this shipped keeps an empty
    block and refuses on its next fire, which is visible and fixable — the direction that cannot
    silently lose the property. `automation doctor` reports it (S116) and re-saving the trigger
    freezes it correctly.
