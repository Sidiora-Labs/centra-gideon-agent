"""Dispatch: inbox + wakeup, and the event-bus delivery contract
(AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.2/§3.3 — S64).

The scheduler never executes directly. A fired trigger enqueues a typed
payload plus a wakeup signal;
a dispatcher claims and drives it. Crash-safety falls out of that shape — the payload survives an
executor crash because it is in the queue, not in a coroutine.

**The bug this session fixes, reproduced before it was written.** `event_triggers._schedule_fire`
records the fire and then does `asyncio.get_running_loop()`; with no loop
(a sync CLI memory write) it
`return`s. Measured on a real store: `fire_count` becomes 1 and **the action is dropped with nothing
anywhere recording that it did not run**. That is the silent drop §1.3
bans, in shipped code. The spool
here is the fix: a sync-context fire is written to disk and drained on the next tick.

The delivery rules, each with the failure it prevents:

* **Peek-then-deliver-then-ack**, never atomic read-and-mark. An event acked before its handler
  finished is an event lost to a crash mid-handling.
* **The cursor advances only on CONSUMED events.** A transient failure (provider down, key absent)
  HOLDS the drain with a bounded retry; a permanent one (payload
  malformed) advances and logs. Without
  the distinction you get either event loss or a poison pill that stalls the queue forever.
* **Payload-hash dedup window.** A webhook retried by its sender and an fs event fired twice for one
  save are the same work; a hash window collapses them.
* **Monotonic cursor per (trigger, stream).** A repeatedly-firing trigger must never reprocess
  history — the failure mode where enabling one trigger replays a month of events.

Pure records and decisions plus one small on-disk spool. The loop that drains it is the service.
