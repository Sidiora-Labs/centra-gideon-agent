"""The file-watch poll runtime — what actually FIRES a `file` trigger (§3 / crit 2 — S93).

S83 shipped `file_watch.py`: glob expansion, content-hash dedup, the three-way delta. Its own
PARTIAL note recorded why it stopped there — "there is no unified trigger store" to enumerate
`file` triggers from. S87 shipped that store and S92 made file triggers CREATABLE in chat. Measured
here before writing a line: `file_watch.changed_files` has **zero live callers**, and the tick
clock (`service.due_ids`) only surfaces triggers with a `next_fire_at` — a `file` trigger has none,
so nothing ever polls it. S92's criterion-2 automation is present and inert: the user can create
"when a file in ~/notes changes…" and it will never fire.

This closes that gap and ONLY that gap. It is deliberately DISJOINT from `ScheduleService`, which
fires clock crons and reads no `file` trigger — so wiring this into boot beside it **cannot
double-fire** anything. That is what makes it the additive, completable cutover rather than the
class-B clock switch-over the queue still defers.

**What it owns:** enumerate enabled `file` triggers, poll each one's globs against its persisted
`WatchState`, and hand a real change to the shipped dispatch→executor chain. **What it does not:**
the LLM turn (S90's executor, injected as a runner) and the clock fire path (`ScheduleService`).

**WatchState is a SIDECAR, not the trigger.** `config_dir()/trigger-watch/<safe-id>.json`, matching
the `trigger-spool.jsonl` / `task_leases/` convention. A watch's hash map is high-churn runtime
state; writing it back onto the trigger entity would rewrite `triggers.json` on every poll and race
every unrelated edit — the same reason leases are sidecars (S61d).
