"""The disposition table, as code (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §2 — S63).

§2 is a 17-row table saying what happens to every automation-adjacent surface in the codebase:
ABSORBED, KEPT, or KEPT-and-gains-a-duty. It is the most consequential document in this plan — a
surface absorbed by mistake loses its semantics, and a surface kept by mistake means two schedulers
running at once.

It lives here as data rather than only in prose because a table in a markdown file cannot be checked
against the tree. `missing_surfaces()` verifies every module the table
names still exists, so a rename
during the migration fails a test instead of leaving a row pointing at nothing. That is the same
reasoning as S62's `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP`: the mapping is the artifact, and an unchecked mapping is a
document that is true when written and wrong later.
