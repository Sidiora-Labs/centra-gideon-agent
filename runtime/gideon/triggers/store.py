"""`triggers.json` — the one trigger store (§1 / §6 step 2 — S87).

§1: "One store: `~/.gideon/triggers.json` (fcntl + atomic write, absorbing crons.json /
hooks.json / event_triggers.json / autonudge config). Parsed with **never-throw structural
validation** (AUTO-R15): typed issue records + closest-match resolution rendered as WARNING chips —
an agent-authored near-miss must never become a silently-dead trigger."

**Why this is buildable now, when S83/S86 recorded the store as blocked.** Those sessions were right
that the store and the SERVICE are separate, and wrong to treat them as one unit: the service needs
the store, not the reverse. Everything the store itself depends on is shipped and was measured
before
this file existed —

* `Trigger.to_dict()` + `parse_trigger()` round-trip losslessly (verified field-by-field: zero
  fields
  fail to survive), so persistence needs no new serializer.
* `parse_trigger` already NEVER raises and already returns closest-match resolution (`'clok'` →
  `closest='clock'`), which is R15's whole requirement. A store that re-implemented validation would
  have a second opinion about what a valid trigger is.
* `migrate_crons()` already consumes a raw `crons.json` dict and reports `lossless`/`unaccounted`.
* `ScheduleService` already ships the exact fcntl-lock + atomic-write + mtime-`_sync` triad §1 asks
  for, and §6's "MCP-process gotcha" makes that mtime contract mandatory rather than incidental.

So this session is the store and nothing else. The service, the loop and the executor stay out —
those genuinely need the WakeupDispatcher, and S86's fire path is what they will call.

**Three properties this file exists to guarantee:**

**A broken row never disappears.** `load()` returns EVERY row it read, including the ones with
errors,
each carrying its issues. A store that dropped invalid rows would make an agent-authored typo look
like a trigger the user never created — R15's "silently-dead trigger" in its worst form, because the
user cannot fix what they cannot see. `enabled` is forced False on an error row instead (that is
`parse_trigger`'s own rule), so a broken trigger is VISIBLE and INERT rather than absent.

**A write never truncates the store.** Atomic tmp→rename under an exclusive lock, matching the
shipped
cron store. A partial write here is worse than a lost write: the next `load()` would report every
surviving trigger as malformed.

**A concurrent writer is not silently overwritten.** MCP tools mutate the store from a separate
process (§6's carried-over gotcha), so every mutation re-reads under the lock before writing —
otherwise a chat-created trigger vanishes when the dashboard saves a stale in-memory copy.
