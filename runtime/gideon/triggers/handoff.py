"""Intercept a SYSTEM scheduler write and offer the substrate instead (§7 criterion 12 — S143).

Criterion 12: *"An agent attempting `crontab -e` is prompted and offered the substrate;
`automation doctor` flags an orphaned workflow ref and a broad file-watch glob."* The second clause
shipped (`calendar.diagnose` + `GET /api/triggers/doctor`, S110). The first was **unmet — measured,
not inferred**::

    is_sensitive_bash_command("crontab -e")                     -> None
    denied_command_reason("crontab -e")                         -> None
    is_sensitive_bash_command("echo '* * * * *' | crontab -")   -> None
    ... launchctl load / systemctl --user enable                 -> None, None

So an agent could install a cron in the user's real crontab and nothing said a word. The one
`crontab` pattern that does exist lives in `supply_chain.py`'s app-bundle scanner, which reads app
files at INSTALL time — a different surface, and one an agent's own bash call never touches.

**Why this matters beyond tidiness.** A cron in the system crontab is invisible to every surface
this program spent 65 sessions building: no ledger row, no autopause, no quiet window, no capability
fence, no kill switch, no run history. It survives uninstall. It is the one way for unattended work
to escape the substrate entirely — so an agent reaching for it is exactly when to say "there is a
supported way to do this".

**PROMPTED, not blocked — and this is the whole design decision.** Criterion 12 says *prompted and
offered*, and the distinction is load-bearing in both directions:

* Blocking would be wrong. Reading a crontab is diagnostic (`crontab -l` is how you find out what is
  already scheduled), and a legitimate one-off — reproducing a user's bug, migrating their existing
  crons INTO the substrate — is real work. A hard denial would make the migration path itself
  impossible, which is the opposite of offering an alternative.
* Silence is also wrong, which is what shipped.

So: WRITES prompt and carry the offer; READS pass silently. The read/write split is the whole
predicate, because it is what separates "look at what is scheduled" from "schedule something outside
every control on this machine".

**Fail-OPEN on an unrecognized command.** This is an advisory seam, not a security fence: its output
is a prompt and a suggestion. A false positive nags the user about a legitimate command and trains
them to click through prompts — which degrades every *real* approval prompt on the machine. The
capability fence, PathGuard and the denylist are the fail-closed controls (see
`docs/architecture/provider-boundary.md` and `triggers/pathguard.py`); this is not one of them.
