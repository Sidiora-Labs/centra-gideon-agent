"""Autopause, parking, and quarantine — generalized (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.7 — S68).

The plan is explicit that autopause-after-5 **already exists** for the cron action path
(`GatewayOrchestrator._maybe_autopause`) and that the substrate *generalizes* it rather than
inventing it. So the first thing this session did was measure what the shipped one counts.

**The measured defect.** `_maybe_autopause` is called from four sites and increments the same
counter at every one, with no notion of WHY the fire did not produce work. Driven directly, five
consecutive **denylist blocks** set `enabled = False`: a policy decision the operator configured on
purpose reads as five failures and silently disables the user's trigger. The other three sites are
equally undifferentiated — an unknown-provider config error that can never succeed takes five fires
to stop, exactly as long as a network blip that would have healed on its own.

That is R7's point, and it is why `TRUE_FAILURE_OUTCOMES` (S62) is a single-member set. The rules:

* **Only `FAILED` counts.** A trigger that skipped five times because quiet hours held is working
  as configured; autopausing it punishes the user for saying "not at night".
* **An outage PARKS, it does not autopause.** `auth_unavailable` / `transport_unavailable` are
  conditions of the world, not of the automation. Parking is reversible and self-healing; burning a
  failure budget on an expired token means the automation is still disabled after the user fixes it.
* **Injection screening QUARANTINES and never auto-retries.** Re-running a fire whose payload
  matched an injection pattern is the one case where retrying is itself the harm.
* **Config errors autopause IMMEDIATELY.** A fire that can never succeed — no such action provider
  — has nothing to wait for. Five attempts is four pointless fires and four rows of noise.

`FAILURE_BUDGET = 5` matches the shipped constant so migrated jobs keep the tolerance their authors
observed. Pure decisions over records; the service owns the writes.
