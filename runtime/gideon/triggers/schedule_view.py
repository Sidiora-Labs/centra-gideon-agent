"""`Trigger` → the schedule wire shape (§6 API re-point — S98).

§6: "**The existing `/api/triggers` facade becomes the single API by re-pointing its three
backends at
one store** — its `kind:<raw>` id namespace is the migration map." This module is the
projection that
makes that possible for the SCHEDULE backend: it renders a clock `Trigger` in exactly the shape
`_serialize_schedule` produced from a `ScheduleJob`, so the API contract and the frontend
consuming it
are unchanged while the backend underneath becomes the unified store.

**Measured before writing — the data is all carried, at different ADDRESSES.**
`_serialize_schedule` reads 21 fields off `ScheduleJob`. A migrated `Trigger` has none of them by
that name, but `models.LEGACY_FIELD_MAP["ScheduleJob"]` declares where each one went, and every
destination was verified against a real migration:

    spec.timezone / spec.skip_dates / spec.strict   ← timezone / skip_dates / strict_schedule
    workflow.inline                                 ← action
    delivery ("channel:C1", "none")                 ← channel / silent
    session  ("pinned:cron:j")                      ← session_key / persistent_session
    capabilities.env                                ← env
    health_status / last_error_summary              ← last_status / last_error
    last_success_at / last_failure_at               ← last_run_ts

Three fields map to `None` — **deliberate drops the plan already decided**, not gaps this module
should paper over: `created_ts` (a display-only timestamp), `last_result` (the run record owns the
output — a copy on the trigger was a second truth), and `acked_items`. The last was verified dead
before dropping it: the `/api/triggers/{id}/ack` route has **zero callers** (no frontend client
method, no MCP tool) and the owner's real store carries **zero acked entries**, so the field is
already-dead weight rather than a live behaviour. `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP` assigns its future owner
("the inbox owns it — Inbox-Unification").

The projection is one-way on purpose. Writes go through `tools.py` / the store, which already own
validation and the honesty contracts (a broken row refuses to enable, a patch allowlist protects the
health fields). A second write path here would be the dual path the clean break forbids.

    """`{total, enabled, broken}` across the unified store — the numbers a status surface reports.

    🔴 THE DEFECT (S107). Two separate surfaces counted automations by asking the legacy service,
    which after the S100/S101 cutover holds nothing: `GET /api/status` reported
    `cron: {"running": false, "jobs": 0, "enabled": 0}` and the dashboard's SystemHealth widget
    rendered `triggers 0` — driven against a home with three valid store triggers, two enabled and
    firing. Both were honest readings of the wrong source, and `running: false` was doubly
    misleading: `load_without_timer` leaves `_running` False BY DESIGN, so the field said "the
    scheduler is down" on a perfectly healthy machine.

    `broken` is reported because the store knows it and the legacy service could not: a row that
    fails validation refuses to enable, and a user whose trigger silently stopped counting deserves
    to see the reason on the status surface rather than wonder where it went.

    `legacy` is an optional `ScheduleService` whose jobs are FOLDED IN by id, so a home
    mid-migration counts each automation exactly once rather than double-counting the imported
    ones. It retires with the class.
