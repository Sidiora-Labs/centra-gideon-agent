"""The flat trigger-STORE registry (TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES §3 — TSE-4).

Mirrors :mod:`gideon.trigger_sources.registry` and ``sync_transports/registry.py``: the
``trigger`` provider-type handler (``providers/registry.py::TriggerTypeHandler``) registers an
installed store here on app enable and removes it on disable. A dict at module scope, not a class —
the same shape the three sibling registries already use, so this is not a fourth idiom.

**Registered ≠ trusted with execution.** A registered store is READ, and that is all: §3 says a
trigger provider "contributes trigger rows, never execution". Nothing here hands a provider a fire,
a payload, a run or a credential, and :func:`gideon.triggers.provider.armable` drops every row
the provider attributes to somebody other than the owner before the service sees it.

**A faulty provider store must not stop local automations.** Every read below is wrapped: a store
that raises, hangs on its own socket or returns garbage is logged and skipped for that pass, leaving
``triggers.json`` rows arming exactly as they do with no app installed. The opposite choice —
letting a team backend's outage silence the owner's own morning automation — is the failure mode
this degradation exists to prevent, and it is the same fail-open direction ``trigger_sources``
takes for a store fault on the enable path.
