"""Event-kind parity and lifecycle-event dormancy (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §2/§7 — S67).

Two problems, one root cause: a user can configure something the code never delivers, and nothing
tells them. Both are made QUERYABLE here rather than fixed by faking the missing behaviour.

**Dormancy, measured.** `hooks.HOOK_EVENTS` declares 15 lifecycle events and
`validation.ALLOWED_HOOK_EVENTS` allows all 15, so the hook UI offers all 15 as equals. Only some
are ever fired. A user configures a `SessionEnd` hook, the API accepts it, and it never runs.

Measuring this correctly took three attempts, and the failures are the reason `DORMANT_EVENTS` below
is a reviewed constant rather than a scan:

* Counting `HOOK_EVENT_*` text hits calls `Stop` live off `autonudge.py`'s **docstring** and calls
  seven events live off `chat_runner.py`'s **import block** — text that fires nothing.
* The real `TaskComplete` fire (`tasks/native.py`) passes `payload["event"]` from
  `pool.lifecycle_payload`, so it contains **no constant reference at all** and a scan calls the one
  event this program deliberately wired DORMANT.

Both directions are harmful, and the second is worse: telling someone their working hook is dead. So
dormancy is derived from the fire sites reached through `ScriptHookStore.fire`/`fire_for_ids`, which
is the only path that runs a hook, and `verify_dormancy()` re-derives the live set from the running
store's own catalog so a wired event cannot leave this list stale and lying.

**Parity, measured.** §2 says the `event` kind's facade is uneven. It is worse than uneven: in
`dashboard/handlers/triggers.py` the `event` kind is handled in `list`, `create` and `DELETE`, and
`toggle`/`run`/`test`/`history`/`PUT` have **no `event` branch**, so an `event:`-prefixed id falls
through to the `schedule` branch and is looked up among cron jobs. It is not there, so the user gets
`404 {"error": "not found"}` — the API says their trigger does not exist. `PARITY_OPERATIONS` plus
`missing_operations()` turn that into an assertion a facade test can make per kind.

#: set from the running hook store and reports disagreement, so wiring an event and forgetting this
#: list is a caught test failure rather than a lie in the UI.
#:
#: `TaskComplete` is deliberately ABSENT: it was dormant when AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE was written (the
#: plan says 8) and this program wired it in S60 via `tasks/native.py`.
#:
#: **EMPTY as of S82** — criterion 5's second clause ("the 8 dormant lifecycle events actually
#: fire") is closed. The remaining seven were wired to real fire sites through
#: `triggers/lifecycle_fire.py`: `MemoryWrite` on a successful `write_lesson`, `SubagentSpawn` on a
#: non-rejected `spawn`, `ApprovalRequest` alongside the approval broadcast, `ContextCompact` on the
#: real compaction (not the under-cap passthrough), `PreResponse`/`PostResponse` around the stream,
#: and `SessionEnd` on all three endings (`removed`/`destroyed`/`shutdown`).
#:
#: The set is KEPT rather than deleted, with its `verify_dormancy()` guard: a future event added to
#: `hooks.HOOK_EVENTS` ahead of its subsystem belongs here, and a declaration with no fire site is
#: exactly what this constant exists to make visible.
DORMANT_EVENTS: frozenset[str] = frozenset()

#: Why each dormant event does not fire, and what would wire it. Per-event rather than one generic
#: sentence: "no code fires this" tells a user nothing actionable, while naming the subsystem that
#: would own the fire site makes the gap legible and the fix findable.
#:
#: Empty alongside `DORMANT_EVENTS` (S82). `test_every_dormant_event_has_a_note` keeps the two in
#: step, so a newly declared dormant event cannot ship without saying why it is dormant.
