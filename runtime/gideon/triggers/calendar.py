"""Calendar-aware scheduling: quiet windows + the duty gate (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE AUTO-A1/A2 — S70).

`gates.quiet_hours` has been a RESERVED key with no semantics since S62 — declared in `GATE_KEYS`,
accepted by validation, and consulted by nothing. This module gives it meaning, and adds the
duty-gate seam beside it.

**Measured before writing.** `providers/entity_routes._in_quiet_window` already exists and gets the
hard part right (a window may wrap midnight; a zero-length window never matches). But it is
notification-scoped and cannot express what AUTO-A1 requires: no day-of-week, one window per call,
server-local minutes with no timezone, and a bare bool with no catch-up-or-skip resolution. So the
wrap SEMANTICS are preserved deliberately — two different answers to "is 23:00 inside
22:00→08:00" on one machine would be a bug nobody could explain — while the shape grows the three
missing dimensions.

The rules, each with the failure it prevents:

* **A quiet window SUPPRESSES, it does not cancel.** Whether the missed fire runs afterwards is the
  trigger's `quiet_resolution`: `skip` drops it, `catch_up` runs it once when the window closes. A
  single hard-coded choice is wrong for half of all automations — a nightly backup wants catch-up, a
  "post to the team channel" wants skip, and guessing produces either a 3am Slack message or a
  backup
  that silently never ran.
* **The duty gate FAILS OPEN, with a time-box.** It is the one gate here that calls out to a
provider
  (a calendar app), and §1.4's classification is explicit: a broken calendar app must not silence
  every automation on the machine. A quiet window is local arithmetic and cannot hang, so it stays
  fail-closed in the sense that it always produces an answer.
* **The duty gate is LLM-free by contract.** A gate consulted on every fire cannot cost a model
call;
  that is how a 5-minute trigger becomes a budget incident.

Pure functions plus one provider registry. Nothing here fires or writes.

    time would have struck the WRONG column — a grid that is confidently wrong, which is worse than
    the one that was merely silent.

    The duty gate is deliberately NOT evaluated here. It is async, provider-backed, and answers
    about
    a moment in time — calling it 200 times for a projected week would be both slow and wrong (a
    calendar's answer for next Thursday is not knowable now).

    **🔴 `next_after` closes the CRON GAP (S103).** This function took only `interval_secs`, so the
    week grid OMITTED every cron trigger — its caller's own comment admitted it ("a cron trigger is
    omitted rather than mis-plotted"). At the time that was right: nothing could iterate a cron's
    fires. S96's `arm.next_fire` can, so a caller now passes a stepper — `next_after(t) -> float` —
    and a cron plots on the same annotated grid as an interval. Omitting them made the week view a
    forecast of only half the user's automations, silently.
