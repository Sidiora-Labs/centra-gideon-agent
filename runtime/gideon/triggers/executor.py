"""The executor: drain a session inbox, run the action, classify the outcome (§3 / §1.3 — S90).

§3's fire path ends: "… → create run (full or ledger-only) → engine executes under the
`headless` profile
→ **outcome classification (§1.3)** → delivery contract (decision 13) → health rollup +
failure policy."

S86 built the gate order, S87 the store, S88 the tick, S89 the dispatcher. This is the last
link: it takes
what S89 queued onto a session inbox and turns it into a typed outcome plus a delivery.

**Measured before writing — every dependency shipped, and two honesty contracts already fought
for.**

* `ScheduleService._execute` runs an action through an INJECTED `_on_job` callback, not a hard-coded
  provider. So this module takes a runner too: a trigger executor that imported the action registry
  directly would be untestable without a live provider, and the shipped scheduler already proved the
  injection point works.
* **The `_STATUS_PENDING` sentinel is load-bearing.** `_execute` seeds `last_status =
  "_pending"` and only
  defaults to `"ok"` if the sentinel SURVIVED — its comment says why: "so a failed action's
  'error' is no
  longer CLOBBERED by an unconditional 'ok' (the honest-status bug T7 set out to kill: a failed run
  recorded as success)". This module reproduces that three-state logic exactly.
* **`launched` ≠ succeeded.** `engine.dispatch_action`'s docstring: "'launched' means
  background work
  STARTED, not that it succeeded, so it maps to DEGRADED with a reason rather than a clean DONE.
  Reporting it as success would make a fire-and-forget action look verified." S84 preserved the same
  distinction in the history projection (`launched` → `deferred`). This preserves it a third time.
* `dispatch.classify_handler_outcome` and `autopause.outcome_for_exit` already own the
  exception→outcome
  and exit-type→outcome mappings, so neither is re-derived here.

**What this owns, and the boundary.** It drains one session's inbox, runs each payload through the
supplied runner, classifies the result into `FIRE_OUTCOMES`, and builds S85's delivery. It
does NOT own
the LLM turn itself — that is `SubagentManager.spawn` with its `__wf_depth` cap, which the
caller supplies
as the runner. Keeping the turn injected is what lets the whole chain be driven end to end without a
model.

#: The sentinel meaning "the runner has not reported a verdict yet", reproducing
#: `schedule._STATUS_PENDING`. Its whole purpose is that a default of `"ok"` must apply ONLY
#: when nothing
#: else was reported — otherwise an unconditional success clobbers a runner's own `"error"`,
#: which is the
#: honest-status bug T7 was written to kill.
STATUS_PENDING = "_pending"

#: A runner's reported status → a typed fire outcome. Data rather than branches, so the mapping is
#: reviewable and a new status cannot silently fall through to success.
#:
#: `launched` → `DEFERRED`, never `RAN`: the action started background work and nobody has seen the
#: result. `engine.dispatch_action` maps the same status to DEGRADED for the same reason, and S84's
#: history projection maps it to `deferred` too. Three surfaces, one meaning.
#:
#: 🔴 `skip`/`done`/`report` were ABSENT, and absence here means `unrecognized runner status` →
#: **FAILED** (S155). `run_script_provider` explicitly returns `success=True` for all four of
#: `ok`/`done`/`report`/`skip`, so three statuses a provider calls success were recorded as failures
#: — and a failure is not cosmetic on this path: `autopause` spends a 5-failure budget off these
#: rows, so a healthy weekly script reporting `skip` would pause its own automation.
#:
#: `skip` → `SKIPPED_NOOP`, which is the value §1.3 defines as "ran and mutated nothing durable" and
#: which `INERT_OUTCOMES` already folds out of the default runs view. It had a live reader
#: (`history.is_inert`) and no writer.
#:
#: `done`/`report` → `RAN`: both DID the work. `done` additionally means one-shot ("remove the job
#: after this run"), but that is a LIFECYCLE decision belonging to the caller that owns the job, not
#: a different account of what this fire did — conflating the two would make a completed final run
#: indistinguishable from one that no-opped.
