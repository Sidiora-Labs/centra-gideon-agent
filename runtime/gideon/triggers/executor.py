"""The executor: drain a session inbox, run the action, classify the outcome (§3 / §1.3 — S90).

§3's fire path ends: "… → create run (full or ledger-only) → engine executes under the
`headless` profile
→ **outcome classification (§1.3)** → delivery contract (decision 13) → health rollup +
failure policy."

S86 built the gate order, S87 the store, S88 the tick, S89 the dispatcher. This is the last
link: it takes
what S89 queued onto a session inbox and turns it into a typed outcome plus a delivery.

**Measured before writing — every dependency shipped, and two honesty contracts already fought
for.**

* `ScheduleService._execute` runs an action through an INJECTED `_on_job` callback, not a hard-coded
  provider. So this module takes a runner too: a trigger executor that imported the action registry
  directly would be untestable without a live provider, and the shipped scheduler already proved the
  injection point works.
* **The `_STATUS_PENDING` sentinel is load-bearing.** `_execute` seeds `last_status =
  "_pending"` and only
  defaults to `"ok"` if the sentinel SURVIVED — its comment says why: "so a failed action's
  'error' is no
  longer CLOBBERED by an unconditional 'ok' (the honest-status bug T7 set out to kill: a failed run
  recorded as success)". This module reproduces that three-state logic exactly.
* **`launched` ≠ succeeded.** `engine.dispatch_action`'s docstring: "'launched' means
  background work
  STARTED, not that it succeeded, so it maps to DEGRADED with a reason rather than a clean DONE.
  Reporting it as success would make a fire-and-forget action look verified." S84 preserved the same
  distinction in the history projection (`launched` → `deferred`). This preserves it a third time.
* `dispatch.classify_handler_outcome` and `autopause.outcome_for_exit` already own the
  exception→outcome
  and exit-type→outcome mappings, so neither is re-derived here.

**What this owns, and the boundary.** It drains one session's inbox, runs each payload through the
supplied runner, classifies the result into `FIRE_OUTCOMES`, and builds S85's delivery. It
does NOT own
the LLM turn itself — that is `SubagentManager.spawn` with its `__wf_depth` cap, which the
caller supplies
as the runner. Keeping the turn injected is what lets the whole chain be driven end to end without a
model.
