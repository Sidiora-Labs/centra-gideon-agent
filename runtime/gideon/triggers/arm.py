"""Arming the clock: a trigger spec → its next fire (§3.1 — S96).

**🔴 THE BLOCKER THIS EXISTS TO CLEAR, measured before writing.** A migrated cron lands in
`triggers.json` with **`next_fire_at` empty**, and `service.due_ids` only surfaces triggers that
HAVE a `next_fire_at`. So:

    store.migrate_from_crons()   # lossless: true, enabled: true
    SVC.due_ids(...)             # []
    SVC.boot(store, ...)         # {'rearmed': [], 'total': 1}
    # next_fire_at after boot:   ('j-cron', '(none)')  → due_ids STILL []

A migrated cron is **permanently inert** in the new engine: it reports migrated-and-enabled and
never fires. That is the real reason the clock cutover could not proceed — not the double-fire risk
the queue described, which is downstream of a tick that can actually arm a clock.

`scheduling.py` had `recompute_from_completion` (interval only) and `boot_recovery` (needs an
EXISTING `next_fire_at`); `service.next_after_completion` returns 0.0 for every non-interval kind by
design ("the recurrence engine's job"). Nothing computed a FIRST fire from a spec. This module is
that missing primitive, for every member of `CLOCK_KINDS`.

**Semantics are inherited, not invented.** `schedule.compute_next_run_ts` is the shipped, live
computation for the same question, and its two subtle rules are preserved verbatim here:

* **A cron expression is evaluated in the trigger's OWN timezone**, by building the croniter base as
  `datetime.fromtimestamp(now, tz=<trigger tz>)` — croniter interprets the expression in the base's
  tz and `get_next(float)` returns a UTC epoch. Evaluating in UTC instead would silently shift every
  tz-bearing job by the offset, which on a DST boundary is a moving target.
* **A past one-shot `at` returns 0.0 (never fires again)** rather than "now": re-arming an elapsed
  one-shot converts a missed appointment into an immediate surprise fire.

    🔴 SKIP DATES ARE HONOURED HERE (S112). Measured before fixing: a trigger with
    `skip_dates: ["2026-08-04"]` armed to **09:00 on exactly that date**. The legacy
    `ScheduleService._is_due` checked skip dates on every fire; the substrate carried, validated,
    migrated and *displayed* the field (`calendar.py` even renders "struck columns" for it) while
    the fire path ignored it — a user's explicit "not on this day" did nothing. So the raw cadence
    is computed by `_raw_next_fire` and this wrapper advances past any skipped day, in the trigger's
    OWN timezone (a date is a local-calendar question; on a UTC host the same instant is a
    different date).

    0.0 means "not armable", and callers must treat it as "leave `next_fire_at` alone / do not
    schedule" — never as "fire now". The distinction matters for an elapsed one-shot: arming it to
    `now` would fire a missed appointment immediately.

    `last_fire` anchors an interval so a recompute does not re-phase the schedule; it defaults to
    the trigger's `created_at` grid, matching `next_after_completion`'s §3.1 anchoring rule.

    `jitter_secs: 300` plus `strict: true`, and with neither — all three produced `now + 3600.0`.
    So AUTO-A1's acceptance bar ("migrated cron fires in its old jitter slot") was unmet, and the
    models module's own comment names this exact failure: "the trigger loads, the service ignores
    the key, and the automation behaves in a way its author cannot explain."

    Uses `scheduling.jitter_offset` — the SAME BLAKE2b-over-trigger-id algorithm the boot stagger
    uses and that `ScheduleService._jitter_offset` used, because AUTO-A1 requires the offset be
    "preserved byte-compatibly from schedule.py": a migrated cron must land in the slot the job it
    came from occupied. A fresh random offset would re-phase every schedule on migration day, which
    is the one thing a migration must not do.

    `strict: true` is the documented opt-OUT (`schedule.py`'s field says it plainly: "when True,
    skip jitter and fire exactly on schedule"), so an exact wall-clock fire stays available.

    Applied AFTER skip-date advancement, then RE-CHECKED against the skip set — because jitter can
    push a late fire across midnight INTO a skipped day. Measured: a `59 23 * * *` cron with
    `jitter_secs: 600` and `2026-08-05` skipped armed to **2026-08-05T00:02** — onto the very day
    the user excluded. A skip date is a promise about a calendar day, so when the offset would break
    it, the fire keeps its honest grid slot rather than the spread — losing the jitter is a
    nicety; landing on a skipped day is a broken guarantee.

    The offset is always FORWARD — pulling a fire earlier could fire it before the instant its own
    cadence chose, which for a cron is simply wrong.
