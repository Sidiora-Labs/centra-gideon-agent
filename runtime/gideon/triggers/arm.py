"""Arming the clock: a trigger spec → its next fire (§3.1 — S96).

**🔴 THE BLOCKER THIS EXISTS TO CLEAR, measured before writing.** A migrated cron lands in
`triggers.json` with **`next_fire_at` empty**, and `service.due_ids` only surfaces triggers that
HAVE a `next_fire_at`. So:

    store.migrate_from_crons()   # lossless: true, enabled: true
    SVC.due_ids(...)             # []
    SVC.boot(store, ...)         # {'rearmed': [], 'total': 1}
    # next_fire_at after boot:   ('j-cron', '(none)')  → due_ids STILL []

A migrated cron is **permanently inert** in the new engine: it reports migrated-and-enabled and
never fires. That is the real reason the clock cutover could not proceed — not the double-fire risk
the queue described, which is downstream of a tick that can actually arm a clock.

`scheduling.py` had `recompute_from_completion` (interval only) and `boot_recovery` (needs an
EXISTING `next_fire_at`); `service.next_after_completion` returns 0.0 for every non-interval kind by
design ("the recurrence engine's job"). Nothing computed a FIRST fire from a spec. This module is
that missing primitive, for all four `CLOCK_KINDS`.

**Semantics are inherited, not invented.** `schedule.compute_next_run_ts` is the shipped, live
computation for the same question, and its two subtle rules are preserved verbatim here:

* **A cron expression is evaluated in the trigger's OWN timezone**, by building the croniter base as
  `datetime.fromtimestamp(now, tz=<trigger tz>)` — croniter interprets the expression in the base's
  tz and `get_next(float)` returns a UTC epoch. Evaluating in UTC instead would silently shift every
  tz-bearing job by the offset, which on a DST boundary is a moving target.
* **A past one-shot `at` returns 0.0 (never fires again)** rather than "now": re-arming an elapsed
  one-shot converts a missed appointment into an immediate surprise fire.
