"""The `view` kind — pull-on-view refresh (R10 / §7 item 8 — S123).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.** `view` is the FOURTH declared kind found with no runtime, after
`file` (S93), `web_watch` (S121) and `run_completed` (S122). It is in `KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS`
accepts `{surface_binding, ttl_secs}`, the store persists it, `/api/triggers` lists it and the
Automations page renders it. Measured: `surface_binding` is referenced by **exactly one** line
in the entire tree — its own declaration in `SPEC_KEYS`. Nothing reads it, so nothing could
ever fire a `view` trigger.

**Why this one is not a poll, and why that is the point.** §3's own words: *"Pull-on-view (R10):
fires when a bound surface (dashboard tile, artifact open) renders past TTL; within TTL serve
cache … Sidesteps the 1440-run-dirs critique by never firing unviewed."* A minutely clock
trigger produces 1440 run directories a day whether or not anyone looks; a `view` trigger
fires only when a human actually opens the thing. So the runtime is a function a RENDER calls,
not a background loop — adding a poll here would reintroduce exactly the cost R10 exists to
avoid.

**The TTL is the whole control.** Two renders inside the window must serve cache and cost
nothing; the first render past it refreshes. That makes the trigger's expense proportional to
attention rather than to wall-clock time.

**Rate-capped independently of the TTL**, because they answer different questions. A TTL of 60
on a tile someone leaves open in a dashboard that re-renders on every websocket nudge would
refresh once a minute forever — so `MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS` is a floor beneath any
author-supplied TTL, the same reasoning `web_poll` applies to `poll_interval` and for the same
reason S109 recorded: a declared floor that no code reads is not a floor.

**Freshness is a SIDECAR**, matching `file_poll` and `web_poll`: last-refresh state is
high-churn, and writing it onto the trigger entity would rewrite `triggers.json` on every
render and race every unrelated edit.

**What this does NOT own:** the refresh's own execution (the caller hands the payload to the
shared dispatch, so a `view` fire passes the same gates as every other kind), and the
per-refresh token cost §3 mentions for the runs-inbox freshness column — that number comes
from the executor's run record, not from the decision to refresh.
