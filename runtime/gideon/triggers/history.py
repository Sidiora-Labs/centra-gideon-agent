"""One run-history feed across all three trigger kinds (AUTO §7 criterion 4 — S84).

Criterion 4: "A hook, an event trigger, and a cron all show run history in the same feed with the
same record shape and typed outcomes."

**Measured before writing — three incompatible shapes and one unused vocabulary.**

* `schedule` writes a `ScheduleRun` — `run_id`, `job_id`, `trigger`, `started_at`, `finished_at`,
  `duration_ms`, `status`, `summary`, `trace`, `error` — with `status` from
  `{success, failure, timeout, launched}`.
* `lifecycle` (hooks) keeps NO run store. `ScriptHook` carries `last_run`/`last_status`/`run_count`
  plus a transient `ScriptHookResult` (`exit_code`, `duration_ms`, `stderr`) that is never saved.
* `event` keeps a COUNTER: `fire_count` + `last_fired_at`, no per-fire rows at all.

And `FireRecord` — the typed row S62 designed for exactly this, with `FIRE_OUTCOMES` — is
**exported and
never constructed**: `grep "FireRecord("` outside its own module returns nothing. So the shared
shape the criterion asks for already existed on paper and nothing produced it.

**This module projects, it does not migrate.** Each kind keeps its own store; the
projections map what each one HAS onto the common row, and `unified_feed` merges them
newest-first. A migration that rewrote three stores into one is the unified-store program
S83 recorded as unbuilt. A projection is what makes the feed honest meanwhile, because the
alternative is the schedule-only feed the criterion calls wrong.

**Honesty over uniformity, in two places.**

1. **A counter is not a run.** An `event` trigger's `fire_count` becomes ONE synthetic row carrying
   the count, marked `incomplete=True` and `weight=ledger`, never N fabricated rows with invented
   timestamps. `FireRecord.incomplete` exists for this: "a count that was cut short … a reader is
   never misled by a number that stopped early".
2. **`launched` is not `ran`.** The schedule store's honest T7 status — the action started a
   background turn, outcome unknown — maps to `deferred`, not `ran`. Calling it `ran` would report
   success for work nobody has seen, which is the distinction T7 exists to keep.
