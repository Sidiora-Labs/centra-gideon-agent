"""The `run_completed` chain runtime — "when X finishes, run Y" (§7 item 8 — S122).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.** `run_completed` is a declared kind with no firing path. It is in
`KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS` accepts `{source_trigger, source_def}`, the store persists it, `/api/triggers`
lists it and the Automations page renders it. Nothing ever fired one. Measured first, with a
`clock:nightly` and a `run_completed:after` pointed at it:

    clock tick considered: ['clock:nightly']       # the source fires
    file poller:           []
    web poller:            []
    → run_completed:after is reached by NOTHING

So "when my nightly backup finishes, notify me" was creatable, listed, and permanently silent. The
same present-and-inert shape as S121's `web_watch` and S93's `file`, and the third instance of it in
this kind's table — which is why the completeness test in `tests/test_triggers_chain.py` now asserts
every declared kind either has a runtime or a documented reason.

**Chaining is where an automation system earns its keep, and also where it eats itself.** So the two
controls here are not optional:

* **A DEPTH CAP.** A → B → C is useful; A → B → A is an infinite fire loop that a scheduler cannot
  distinguish from enthusiasm. The chain carries its own depth in the payload, and `MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH`
  refuses past it with a visible reason rather than silently stopping.
* **CYCLE DETECTION on the path, not just the depth.** A cap alone bounds the damage but reports
  it as "too deep" when the real answer is "this chain loops". The payload carries the ids already
  fired in this chain, so a repeat is named as a cycle — the difference between a user fixing their
  config and a user believing the depth limit is too low.

**Fired through the SAME dispatch as every other kind**, so a chained action executes identically
to a clock one and passes every gate in `firepath` — including the kill switch (S117) and the
capability fence (S116). A chain with its own dispatch path would be a second place for those
controls to be forgotten, which is precisely how the `web_watch` gap happened.

**What this does NOT own:** the source run's outcome classification (the executor's), and matching
on run OUTCOME (`only_on: failed`) — `SPEC_KEYS` declares only `{source_trigger, source_def}`, and
adding a key the entity does not carry would be a fence nobody can author.
