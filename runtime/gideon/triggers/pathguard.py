"""PathGuard — realpath + symlink matching for the `paths` capability (decision 7 — S118).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.** `paths` has been a first-class member of `CAPABILITY_KEYS` since
S69, fail-closed like every other key, and rendered as a fence in the UI. But `capability_allows`
compares it with `_matches_entry` — **string matching**, built for tool names like
`mcp__github__*`. Paths are not strings for security purposes. Driven before a line was written,
against the real function:

    allowlist: ["/Users/me/notes/*"]

      ALLOW  /Users/me/notes/today.md                 # correct
      deny   /Users/me/secrets.txt                    # correct
      ALLOW  /Users/me/notes/../../.ssh/id_rsa        # 🔴 TRAVERSAL — the fence let it through
      ALLOW  /Users/me/notes/../.aws/credentials      # 🔴 TRAVERSAL

    allowlist: ["/Users/me/notes"]
      ALLOW  /Users/me/notes                          # correct
      deny   /Users/me/notesEVIL                      # correct only by accident of this entry

So a trigger fenced to a notes directory could read an SSH key, and the ledger would record the fire
as permitted. The fence was not weak, it was measuring the wrong thing.

**What this module adds, and why each part exists:**

* **Canonicalization before comparison** (`os.path.realpath` + `expanduser`). `..` is resolved away,
  so a traversal is compared as what it actually reaches rather than as the text the author typed.
* **Symlink-target matching**, which is the half canonicalization alone does not cover for the
  ALLOWLIST side: a watched directory that is itself a symlink into `/etc` must be compared at its
  target. `realpath` on both sides is what makes the two consistent.
* **Boundary-aware containment.** `startswith` on a directory is the classic prefix-sibling bug:
  `/Users/me/notes` would contain `/Users/me/notesEVIL`. Containment requires an exact match or a
  separator immediately after the root.
* **Sensitive paths are refused even when explicitly allowlisted.** `security.is_sensitive_path`
  already knows the credential locations; an allowlist entry naming one is far likelier to be a
  mistake (or an injected edit) than an intention, and `bypass_immune` in decision 7's own text
  reserves checks no allowlist may silence.

**Fail-CLOSED, unlike the kill switch.** An unresolvable path denies. That asymmetry is deliberate
and matches S117's reasoning from the other side: a stuck-closed kill switch stops work the user
depends on and looks like a broken scheduler, while a stuck-open path fence hands out filesystem
access nobody granted. When in doubt about *reach*, refuse.

**This module does not walk the filesystem** and never opens a file. It answers "would this path
be inside that scope", so it is pure, cheap enough for a per-action check, and safe to call on a
path that does not exist yet (a write target usually does not).
