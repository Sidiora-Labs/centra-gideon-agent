"""The Trigger entity, its per-kind specs, and the fire records (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §1 — S62).

One record replaces three stores. The whole value is that a person edits ONE form and reads ONE
history, so the shape has to hold everything `crons.json`, `event_triggers.json` and the hook/
autonudge configs carry — measured field by field before this was written, and asserted per field
by the tests rather than by inspection. A migration that silently dropped `skip_dates` would keep
firing on a holiday and the user would never learn why.

Two properties the plan calls out that shape everything here:

* **Never-throw structural validation (R15).** A trigger authored by an agent with a near-miss field
  name must become a WARNING chip, not a silently-dead row. `parse_trigger` therefore returns
  `(trigger, issues)` and never raises — the trigger still loads, disabled if it must be, and the
  issue says which key it did not recognize and what the closest known one is.
* **Silent drops are banned (R2).** Every suppressed or degenerate fire is a ledger row with a typed
  outcome and a one-line reason. `Outcome` is that vocabulary, and it is closed: a fire that ends in
  none of these is a fire nobody can account for.

Pure records and decisions. No scheduling, no I/O, no firing — those are sessions 63/64.
