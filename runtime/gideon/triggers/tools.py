"""The `automation_*` chat-tool namespace (§4 — S92).

§4 specifies one namespace replacing `schedule_add/…`, and criterion 2 is its bar: *"When a file
in ~/notes changes, summarize it into my knowledge base" is creatable in chat in ONE message.*

S83 shipped the `file` kind's watch runtime and then recorded the honest reason it could not close
criterion 2: "Criterion 2 needs `automation_create` (§4), which needs somewhere to PUT a `file`
trigger. Measured: there is no unified trigger store." **S87 shipped that store.** Re-measured
before writing a line here: a `file` trigger round-trips through `TriggerStore` with zero errors,
and `SPEC_KEYS` accepts all nine kinds. The blocker is gone, so the tool lands.

**🔴 WHAT THE PROBES FOUND — the per-minute-poll trap.** The only NL schedule path is
`nl_to_cron`, cron-shaped by construction. Fed criterion 2's own sentence it returns an error,
which is the *good* case; the bad case is a model asked for a cron expression while handed a
file-watch request answering `* * * * *`, which validates and silently converts "when a file
changes" into a per-minute LLM turn. So `nl_kind.route()` decides the KIND first, and a
non-cadence request never reaches the cadence converter. Two further defects the probe caught
before any test existed are recorded in `nl_kind` (a URL mis-routing to `file`, and a change verb
that reached the dedup hint but not the routing check).

**What this owns, and the boundary.** Nine tools over `TriggerStore`: create/list/update/pause/
resume/run/history/delete, plus `delete_all` (S109 — the scoped bulk delete carried over when the
`schedule_*` aliases retired; it is the only capability those aliases had that this namespace did
not). It does NOT own the fire path (S86), the tick (S88), dispatch (S89), or
execution (S90) — `automation_run` hands off to the shipped executor rather than re-deriving a
turn. Keeping those injected is what let the whole chain be driven end to end without a model.

Per §4 + decision 5d, an agent-created trigger is tagged `created_by: agent`, **announced** in the
tool's own result text, and **capped** (default 20 active) — "visible, not silent".

    Only `incident` is checked here, and that is deliberate rather than partial. It is the one gate
    in `MANUAL_NEVER_BYPASSES` that is a GLOBAL, operator-thrown state a manual caller can trip
    without knowing; the other three are properties of the fire itself and are enforced where they
    can be evaluated — `screen` needs payload text a manual run does not carry, `capability` is
    checked at dispatch against the frozen block, and `budget`/`claim` are explicitly not spent by a
    manual fire (`record_fire` is not called, so there is no allowance to breach and no claim to
    take). Listing them here without an evaluable input is what produced the inert plan.
