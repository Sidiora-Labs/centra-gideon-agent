"""The `automation_*` chat-tool namespace (§4 — S92).

§4 specifies one namespace replacing `schedule_add/…`, and criterion 2 is its bar: *"When a file
in ~/notes changes, summarize it into my knowledge base" is creatable in chat in ONE message.*

S83 shipped the `file` kind's watch runtime and then recorded the honest reason it could not close
criterion 2: "Criterion 2 needs `automation_create` (§4), which needs somewhere to PUT a `file`
trigger. Measured: there is no unified trigger store." **S87 shipped that store.** Re-measured
before writing a line here: a `file` trigger round-trips through `TriggerStore` with zero errors,
and `SPEC_KEYS` accepts all nine kinds. The blocker is gone, so the tool lands.

**🔴 WHAT THE PROBES FOUND — the per-minute-poll trap.** The only NL schedule path is
`nl_to_cron`, cron-shaped by construction. Fed criterion 2's own sentence it returns an error,
which is the *good* case; the bad case is a model asked for a cron expression while handed a
file-watch request answering `* * * * *`, which validates and silently converts "when a file
changes" into a per-minute LLM turn. So `nl_kind.route()` decides the KIND first, and a
non-cadence request never reaches the cadence converter. Two further defects the probe caught
before any test existed are recorded in `nl_kind` (a URL mis-routing to `file`, and a change verb
that reached the dedup hint but not the routing check).

**What this owns, and the boundary.** Nine tools over `TriggerStore`: create/list/update/pause/
resume/run/history/delete, plus `delete_all` (S109 — the scoped bulk delete carried over when the
`schedule_*` aliases retired; it is the only capability those aliases had that this namespace did
not). It does NOT own the fire path (S86), the tick (S88), dispatch (S89), or
execution (S90) — `automation_run` hands off to the shipped executor rather than re-deriving a
turn. Keeping those injected is what let the whole chain be driven end to end without a model.

Per §4 + decision 5d, an agent-created trigger is tagged `created_by: agent`, **announced** in the
tool's own result text, and **capped** (default 20 active) — "visible, not silent".

#: capped (default 20 active) — visible, not silent." The cap counts ACTIVE agent-made rows only:
#: a paused one is not doing anything, and counting it would make the cap unrecoverable without
#: deleting history the user may still want.
#:
#: WF2LOO-9 made the number configurable. It was a module constant, so the one bound standing
#: between a self-scheduling agent and an unbounded fan-out of clocks could not be tightened by an
#: operator who wanted 5, nor set to 0 to turn self-scheduling off — the only way to change it was
#: to edit the source. Read per call, not captured at import, so a PATCH takes effect without a

#: triggers default to a week (a follow-up that has not fired in 7 days is stale by any reading);
#: recurring ones to 30 days, matching the deliberate-renewal posture `scheduling.is_due` already
#: enforces for expiry. An explicit `ttl_secs` is honoured within [60s, 90d] — clamped, not

    That matters because the alias was not just a convenience: it enforced a real access control —
    `jobs = [j for j in jobs if j.session_key == session_key]`, so an agent could only mass-delete
    automations it had created, and it REFUSED outright when no session key was set. Retiring the
    alias without carrying that scope forward would either lose the bulk operation or (worse) leave
    a future author to re-add it unscoped.

    The scope is `created_by` rather than the legacy `session_key`, because that is the ownership
    the store records. Measured: `mcp_schedule` set `job.session_key` on add, but a row created
    through `tools.create` carries `session="fresh"` (the default) and `created_by="agent"` — so a
    session-keyed filter would match NOTHING for exactly the rows an agent can create, making the
    control vacuous in the new world while looking identical in a diff.

    `confirm` is required for the reason single `delete` requires it, only more so: this is the most
    destructive tool in the namespace. An empty scope reports that it deleted nothing rather than
