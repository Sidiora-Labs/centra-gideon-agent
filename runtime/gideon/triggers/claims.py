"""The claim store: which trigger is running right now (§3.1 overlap — S97).

**🔴 TWO MEASURED DEFECTS THIS CLEARS.** `scheduling.claim_fire` decides overlap from an `existing`
claim the caller supplies, and `firepath.evaluate` returns the claim it granted with the note "the
caller must release it". Measured: **`tick()` passes no `existing_claim` and nothing persists the
granted one.** So:

1. **`overlap: skip` is inert.** Every fire is evaluated against `existing=None`, so the claim gate
   always grants — a trigger whose previous run is still going fires again anyway, which is the
   precise failure `overlap` exists to prevent. The control is present, reviewed, and enforcing
   nothing.
2. **`is_running` is unanswerable.** `ScheduleService` answers it from `self._executing`, a
   PROCESS-LOCAL dict — so it is wrong after a restart (a run in flight reads as idle) and invisible
   to any other process. The API facade needs this to re-point off `ScheduleService`, and a
   process-local set cannot serve it.

A claim is therefore a **sidecar file per trigger** (`<store dir>/trigger-claims/<safe-id>.json`),
the same convention as `trigger-watch/` (S93) and `task_leases/` (S61d), for the same reasons: it
is high-churn runtime state that must not rewrite `triggers.json` on every fire, and it must be
visible ACROSS processes — the MCP tools, the gateway tick, and the API all answer "is it running"
from one place. The root comes from the STORE, so a claim never describes a different store's
trigger.

**Expiry is read-time, not swept.** A claim carries `max_duration_secs`; a reader treats an older
claim as absent rather than requiring a janitor to have run. A crashed run must not hold its trigger
hostage until some cleanup pass notices — the same fail-open direction `pool`'s leases take.

    🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `Trigger.resource_slots` was declared in the entity, persisted, round-tripped
    by `to_dict`/`from_dict` — and read by **nothing**. Found by generalising S134's container audit
    across all 41 dataclasses in `triggers/`: it was the only field with zero
    non-declaration readers.
    §3.5 is explicit: *"triggers/runs declare needs (`gpu`, `local-llm`); the substrate serializes
    conflicting runs per slot and refuses over-capacity starts with a typed RESOURCE_BUSY + holder
    identity (a `deferred` ledger row)."* So a user could declare `resource_slots: ["local-llm"]` on
    three triggers and have all three run a local model at once — the exact contention §3.5
    exists to
    prevent on a machine shared with the interactive user.

    Derived from the CLAIM STORE rather than a second sidecar, which is the design decision here: a
    slot is held exactly as long as its trigger's run is, so claims already answer the
    question. That
    inherits read-time expiry (a crashed run does not hold `gpu` hostage forever) and cross-process
    visibility for free — a separate slot file would need its own reaper and could disagree with the
