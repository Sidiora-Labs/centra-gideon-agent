"""The outbound delivery contract: statusUrl, stable event ids, destination formatting (R18 — S85).

Criterion 10: "A completed-run notification deep-links (statusUrl) to the exact run journal row; a
retried delivery does not double-ping."

**Measured before writing.** A grep for `statusUrl` or `status_url` across `src/gideon`
returns **nothing** — the deep link the criterion names does not exist anywhere in the package.
(Stated as prose rather than as the literal grep pattern: a backslash-pipe alternation inside a
non-raw docstring is an invalid escape sequence, and Python warns on import. Caught by running
the module, not by reading it.) A completed-run notification carries a title and a body, so a
user reading "Nightly digest finished" has no route to the run that produced it. R18 calls that
"the notification→journal dead end".

Three things this owns, all from R18's own list:

* **`statusUrl`** — `#/workflows/runs/<run_id>` for a workflow run, `#/triggers?open=<id>` for
  a fire
  with no run behind it. Verified against the live routes: `WorkflowsSection` documents
  `#/workflows/runs/<run_id>`, and `TriggersListPage` opens its side panel from `?open=<id>`.
* **A stable event id preserved across retries** — the idempotency key a channel consumer
  dedupes on.
  Derived, not random: a `uuid4()` would be a *different* id on the retry, which is precisely the
  double-ping the criterion forbids.
* **Destination-aware formatting** — a rich block for inbox/notify, flattened text for
  `channel:slack`. Slack renders a dict as `[object Object]`; the flattening is not cosmetic.

**This does NOT build a second notification path.** R18 is explicit that delivery routes through
`DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()`. Everything here produces the ARGUMENTS for
that call — `kind`, `title`, `body`, `meta` — and `meta` is the dict `notify` already merges
into the note, so `statusUrl` reaches every surface without widening a schema. The redaction R18
requires happens on the way in, because a run summary can contain a URL or a token from whatever
the run touched.
