"""Who may ARM a trigger — the owner filter (TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES §2.2 — TSE-4).

Once a ``trigger`` provider can contribute rows (see :mod:`gideon.triggers.provider`), the
store is no longer guaranteed to hold only rows this machine's owner wrote. §2.2 states the rule
without wiggle room: the harness **"arms and fires ONLY the owner's triggers — the filter is
``author == owner username`` at arm time, enforced structurally (a foreign row cannot tick, not
'is skipped')"**.

**Structural means the foreign row is never in the candidate set**, not that a gate declines it
later. :func:`gideon.triggers.provider.armable` is the one row source every arm/fire
selection in this package reads, and it applies :func:`owner_authored` before returning. A row
belonging to somebody else therefore never reaches ``due_ids``, ``by_id``, a poll loop's output or
a chain lookup — there is no code path that could decide to fire it, because nothing downstream
ever holds it.

**Empty author reads as the owner's, and that is not a loophole.** ``Trigger.author`` is new; every
row written before it existed has ``""``. Treating those as foreign would silently stop every
automation on every existing install the moment this lands — the loudest possible regression from a
field nobody asked for. It is also the honest answer, matching
:meth:`gideon.tasks.models.Task.belongs_to` and :func:`gideon.identity.current_username`
("empty degrades to today's behavior"): with no attribution recorded there is nobody else the row
could belong to. A provider that wants its rows treated as foreign must SAY whose they are, which is
the same bargain the tasks seam already struck.

**Not a credential.** ``author`` is an attribution string (``identity`` module's first semantic:
"it answers 'who wrote this row', not 'who may'"). This filter is a scoping decision about whose
work this machine performs, not an authorization check — a foreign row is refused because running
somebody else's automation on the owner's machine is wrong by intent, not because the string was
authenticated.
