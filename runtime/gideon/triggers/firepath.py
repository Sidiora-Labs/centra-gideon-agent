"""The fire path: the ordered composition of every gate a fire passes (§3 — S86).

§3 states the order and says "order matters":

    injection screen → gates (debounce/quiet/cooldown/condition) → budget check pre-claim
    (fail-closed) → overlap claim lock → yield/resource-slot check → fence payload →
    capability filter → resolve def / resume target → create run → engine executes →
    outcome classification → delivery contract → health rollup + failure policy

**Measured before writing — fifteen modules, and nothing composes them.** A grep for live
callers of `claim_fire`, `boot_recovery`, `spool_fire`, `drain_spool`, `freeze_capabilities`,
`evaluate_quiet`, `evaluate_duty`, `needs_attention`, `resolve_missed`, `changed_files` and
`build_delivery` outside their own modules returns **NONE** for every one. There is no
`triggers/service.py`. Sessions S62-S85 each built a control and each recorded "NOT DONE (by
scope): the service" — eight such notes in the plan's execution log — and no queue row ever
owned it.

So the controls are individually correct and collectively unreachable. That is the same defect
class this program keeps finding ("present and inert"), at the scale of a whole subsystem.

**What this module is, and is not.**

It is the ORDER, as a pure function: `evaluate(...)` walks the gates in §3's sequence and
returns the first suppression with its typed outcome and reason, or `ALLOWED`. Every gate call
is real — the module imports the shipped decision functions rather than reimplementing their
logic.

It is NOT the loop, the store, or the executor. Those need `triggers.json` (S83's recorded
blocker) and the WakeupDispatcher, and building them against a store that does not exist is what
EXECUTION-PROTOCOL forbids. What a future service session needs is exactly this: a tested
ordering it can call per fire, instead of re-deriving a 13-step sequence from prose under time
pressure and getting the fail-closed budget check on the wrong side of the claim lock.

**Why the order is load-bearing, at the three places it actually bites:**

* **Screen BEFORE gates.** A payload carrying an injection must be refused on content, not on
  timing — otherwise a quiet-hours window silently "protects" the machine and the same payload
  lands at 08:00.
* **Budget BEFORE the claim lock, fail-closed.** Claiming first means a budget-exhausted
  trigger holds a
  lock it will never use, and single-flight then blocks the NEXT legitimate fire. §3.6 says
  fail-closed: an unreadable budget refuses.
* **Capability filter BEFORE resolving the def.** Resolving first means the run exists (and may have
  written its first ledger row) before anyone checks whether the action was permitted at all.
