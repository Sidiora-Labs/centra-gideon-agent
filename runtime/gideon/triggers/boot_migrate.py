"""Run the cron migration at boot, then arm the clock (§7 step 2 — S98).

**🔴 THE GAP, measured before writing.** `store.migrate_from_crons()` exists, is idempotent, and is
called by **nothing outside tests**. So on a real machine `triggers.json` is EMPTY: every cron still
lives only in `crons.json`, and the unified store the whole substrate reads is blank. Two
consequences that block the rest of the cutover:

1. **Re-pointing `/api/triggers`' schedule backend at the store would show the user ZERO
schedules** —
   every cron would vanish from the Automations page while still firing from the legacy service. The
   API re-point (§6) is unbuildable until the store actually holds the crons.
2. **The tick has nothing to fire.** S96 armed the clock and S97 made `overlap` enforce, but
both act
   on rows that were never imported.

So the migration runs at boot, and then the newly-imported rows are ARMED (S96) — an imported cron
with an empty `next_fire_at` is inert, which is the exact defect S96 measured.

**Boot-safe by construction.** The migration upserts by id (idempotent, preserves rows authored
directly in `triggers.json`), leaves `crons.json` untouched on disk (§6's "old file read-only one
release", which `verify-migration` needs to diff), and never raises into boot: a broken or missing
legacy file reports a reason and leaves the store as it was. A gateway that failed to start because
a cron file had a typo would be a far worse outcome than one that starts and reports the problem.

**It does NOT retire the legacy service.** Both still read their own store this release, which is
deliberate: the migration is additive, so a bad import can be corrected by fixing `crons.json` and
restarting rather than by restoring a deleted file. `verify-migration` (S91) is the check that says
whether the import is trustworthy, and it is run here so the answer is in the log at the moment it
matters.

    time — but no writer EVER did before S116, and the fence's input (`FireContext.requested`) was
    never populated, so the gate had never run on a real fire. Wiring it without this backfill would
    have refused every automation already on disk: measured across `tools.create`, the app-cron
    reconciler, the digest reconciler, the CLI and the API, not one set `capabilities`, and each
    creates a write-capable action (`invoke-agent`, `run-prompt`, `notification-digest`).

    So the population that predates the freeze is granted exactly what its CURRENT action already
    does — no more. This is a faithful grandfather, not a widening: the block names the provider the
    row is already configured to run, so re-pointing that action at something else still requires a
    fresh opt-in.

    Idempotent and narrow, modelled on `arm_unarmed`: a row that already carries a block is left
    alone (never widened), a read-only action gets no block (decision 7's default covers it, and
    writing one would imply an opt-in the user never made), and a broken row is skipped because
