"""The lossless cron migration (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §2/§6 — S66).

This is the step that cannot be redone cheaply. Once `crons.json` has been converted and the
legacy service retired, a dropped field is a behaviour nobody can recover without the user's
old file — and the failures are quiet: a lost `skip_dates` fires on a holiday, a lost
`strict_schedule` catches up when the author said not to, a lost `timezone` runs at the wrong
hour for half the year.

So the migration is written against S62's `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP` rather than against the
dataclass, and `unconverted_fields()` proves per job that every field it carried was either
translated or explicitly dropped-with-a-reason. "Looks right" is not the bar; the bar is that
nothing left the building unaccounted for.

Two measurements that changed this code:

* `ScheduleService._save` persists 33 of the dataclass's 35 fields — `dry_run` and
  `last_outcome` never reach disk. They are runtime-only, so the migration cannot read them
  and must not claim to; a converter that mapped them would be translating a value that is
  always the default.
* `ScheduleDefinition` has three kinds (`every`, `at`, `cron`) and the trigger clock spec has
  three too, but they do not line up. Legacy `every` has no trigger equivalent, and mapping it
  onto `at` — the tempting shape match, since both carry one number — would turn every
  recurring interval job into a one-shot that fires once and dies.

Pure functions over dicts. Nothing here writes: the caller owns the store, so a migration can
be run as a dry run and diffed before anything is replaced.
