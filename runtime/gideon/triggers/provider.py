"""The trigger-store seam — the ``trigger`` provider type's contract (TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES §3).

§3 asks for a ``TriggerStore`` interface extracted from the unified service's persistence
("list/get/upsert/delete + change-notification"), with the native implementation wrapping
``triggers.json`` and all of its preserved conventions. That native implementation already exists
and keeps its shipped name: :class:`gideon.triggers.store.TriggerStore`. This module is the
ABSTRACTION it now satisfies, so a provider app can supply rows from somewhere else — a team
backend, a synced file, a fixture — without the service knowing.

``trigger`` IS NOT ``trigger_source`` — read this before merging them
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The two types sit adjacent in ``PROVIDER_TYPES`` and are easy to conflate. They contribute
different halves of an automation, and neither can substitute for the other:

* ``trigger_source`` (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE AUTO-A4, :mod:`gideon.trigger_sources`) supplies
  the **stimulus**. It is a live observer the app runs: ``start``/``stop``, pushing typed
  :class:`~gideon.trigger_sources.base.SourceEvent` payloads onto the one event bus under a
  namespaced source, which the owner's OWN ``kind: event`` trigger rows then match. The app decides
  WHEN something happened; the owner still decides what to do about it.
* ``trigger`` (this module, TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES §3) supplies the **rule**. It is a passive STORE of
  trigger ROWS — definitions, with their kind, schedule, gates and action. The app decides WHICH
  automations exist; it never observes anything and it never executes anything.

So the axes are orthogonal: source is push, store is pull; source is events, store is rows; a source
is live machinery with a lifecycle, a store is persistence with a change notification. A single app
may reasonably register as both, and a trigger row served by a ``trigger`` provider may well be
bound to an event emitted by a ``trigger_source`` provider — which is precisely why collapsing them
into one type would leave no way to say that.

What a ``trigger`` provider may and may not do
----------------------------------------------

**It contributes rows, never execution.** §3: "A trigger provider contributes trigger rows, never
execution — the local ``TriggerService`` does all firing". The provider is asked for rows and is
never handed a fire, a payload, a run or a credential. Every gate the local machine applies —
capability allowlist, budget, quiet hours, kill switch, injection screen — applies unchanged,
because the row travelled but the fire path did not.

**And only the OWNER's rows ever arm.** A shared store legitimately contains other people's
triggers. :func:`armable` is the ONE row source every arm/fire selection in this package reads, and
it drops foreign rows before returning them, so a foreign row is never in the candidate set rather
than being declined by a gate later — see :mod:`gideon.triggers.ownership` for why that
distinction is the whole point.

def armable(store: Any) -> list["Trigger"]:
    """The rows the local service may arm and fire — **the arm path's only row source**.

    Two filters, deliberately fused into one function so neither can be applied without the other:

    * broken rows are dropped (``parse_trigger`` already forced them ``enabled=False``, so they
      were inert anyway — dropping them here just stops seven call sites each re-deriving the
      ``row.ok`` check), and
    * foreign rows are dropped (``author != owner``), which is §2.2's structural requirement.

    Every arm/fire selection inside this package calls this — the clock walk and boot re-arm in
    ``service``, the ``file``/``idle``/``web_watch``/``view`` poll loops, and the chain lookups.
    That is what makes "a foreign row cannot tick" a property of the code rather than a promise:
    nothing downstream is ever handed one, so nothing downstream can decide to fire it.

    Duck-typed on ``store`` (not annotated as :class:`TriggerStoreProvider`) because the service is
    called with test doubles that implement ``load()`` and nothing else, and tightening the
    annotation here would type-error every one of them without making a single fire safer.

    🔴 Reads the store it is GIVEN — deliberately not :func:`all_rows`. A provider's rows are listed
    but not yet armed, because the arm path PERSISTS: ``service.tick`` writes ``next_fire_at``,
    ``run_count`` and the health rollup back with ``store.upsert(...)``, and ``store`` here is the
    native one. Arming a provider's row would therefore either copy it into ``triggers.json`` (two
    rows, one id, diverging) or fail to persist its schedule at all — and a row whose
    ``next_fire_at`` never advances is due again on the very next tick, which is a fire storm, not a
    missed fire. Routing a write back to the store that served the row is the missing piece
    (TSE-5's "owner triggers autonomously fire" needs it); until it exists this seam reads and
    renders, and says so rather than pretending.
