"""The one clock loop: tick → dispatch → execute (§3 / §3.1 — S100).

**🔴 THE CUTOVER, and what measuring made unavoidable.** Until this session
`ScheduleService._arm_timer`
was the ONLY thing that fired a clock trigger. S88 shipped `service.tick()`, S96 taught it to arm,
S97 made `overlap` enforce, S98 imported the crons and S99 re-pointed the API's read — but no loop
ever CALLED the tick. Measured directly:

    boot starts ScheduleService: True
    boot starts a TICK loop    : False

So a trigger created the new way (store only, as `tools.create` writes it) had **no firing path at
all**: the legacy service cannot see `triggers.json`, and nothing ran the engine that can.
Re-pointing
the API's writes before this would have produced silently dead automations.

**And running both loops would DOUBLE-FIRE.** Measured against the owner's real store after the boot
migration: the legacy timer would fire `['j-at','j-cron','j-every','j-seq']` and the tick would fire
`['j-at','j-cron']` — a real overlap of two live automations. So this is a switch-over, not an
addition: the tick becomes the sole clock engine and the legacy timer is **not armed**.

**What the legacy service keeps doing.** `_arm_timer` is only its firing loop; the rest of the class
is still the CRUD surface and the run-history store the API reads (verified: `_load()` + `list_runs`
work with no timer armed, `_timer_task is None`). So `ScheduleService` is still constructed and
loaded, and only its timer is retired here. Its CRUD retires when the writes re-point (the next
session), and the class itself when nothing reads it.

**The loop owns no policy.** It sleeps on `TickResult.next_sleep`, hands each fire to S89's
dispatcher and S90's executor, and releases claims through them. Every decision — due-ness,
gates, arming, retirement — already belongs to `service.tick`, so this file is a driver: what was
missing,
and nothing more.

    🔴 **THE BUG THIS CLOSES: no scheduled trigger had ever executed its action.** `tick` decided
    the fire, wrote a ledger row, persisted a claim and advanced `next_fire_at` — and then the fire
    went nowhere. Measured on a live gateway: 46 cycles of accumulated state contained run records
    from `manual` and `replay` only, never one from a schedule. The UI showed each trigger enabled
    with an advancing next-run time the whole time.

    The break was that `deliver` queues onto a session inbox, and **nothing in the tree creates a
    trigger's session** — `get_or_create` has no caller with a trigger key. So `enqueue` returned
    False, `deliver` reported `NO_SESSION`, and the old loop drained an inbox that had never
    received anything. `deliver`'s own docstring names the two ways out: *"the caller creates the
    session or spools the payload"*. It did neither.

    **A trigger fire does not need a model session.** That is why this takes neither of those two
    ways. In this chain the session is used ONLY as a queue: `drain` pops a payload and hands it to
    the injected `runner`, and in production that runner is the gateway's action dispatch, which
    creates whatever it needs itself. `get_or_create` would spin up a provider process per fire —
    an ACP CLI started at 3am so a `notify` action can print a line — and then the payload would
    still have to be drained back out of the queue it was only ever passed through. So a fire with
    no inbox runs directly, through the same `run_one` a drained fire runs through.

    **A fire that does not run releases its claim.** `tick` persists a claim so `overlap` can
    enforce, and `run_one` releases it in a `finally`. Every path that never reaches `run_one` was
    therefore leaving a claim held for its full `max_duration_secs` (3600s), which left the trigger
    reporting `is_running: true`, recording `skipped_overlap` on every later tick, and answering
    `409 already running` to a manual Run for an hour. `SKIPPED_RUNNING` is a deliberate skip — the
    session is mid-turn and `overlap: skip` says don't pile on — but "we chose not to start a run"
    and "a run is in flight" are different facts, and only the second is what a claim means.

    🔴 **THE GAP THIS CLOSES.** `wakeup.resume_for`, `WakeKind.RESUME`, `Disposition.REQUEUED` and
    `dispatch.droppable` were all written, documented and unit tested, and `resume_for` had **zero
    production callers** — only `wakeup_for` was reachable, from `dispatch_fires`, and it always
    built a wake. So §3's documented "resolve def / **resume target**" step had no producer and no
    consumer: no trigger could target an existing run, and `WF2LOO-9`'s `goal-pursuit-monitor`
    clause was blocked on exactly that.

    **FAIL-CLOSED on a bad target, and loudly.** This fires unattended, so the two directions are
    not symmetric. Fail-open would mean "the target is gone, so start a new run instead" — which
    runs work the author never asked for, on a schedule, with nobody watching, potentially
    mutating. Refusing costs one automation that was already broken. So a gone / finished / foreign
    target REFUSES, and every refusal carries a mandatory reason (`models.require_reason` makes
    that checkable for `refused`) at `logger.warning` — because "a trigger that silently does
    nothing every hour is worse than one that says its target is gone", and a `logger.debug` on a
    permanently broken automation is that silence.

    **Idempotence is INHERITED, not re-implemented.** Two fires landing close together cannot
    resume one run twice, and none of the three guarantees is added here:

    * the same trigger cannot overlap itself — `firepath`'s `claim` gate already refused the second
      fire with `skipped_overlap` before it ever became a wakeup;
    * a gate answer is single-use — `human_input.consume_continuation` claims the token with
      `os.rename` BEFORE reading it, so the loser gets `WF_RESUME_ALREADY_USED`. That primitive is
      measured (the read-then-unlink version it replaced let multiple callers see one payload in
      36 of 40 races); and
    * the token-less "clear the pause" path pops a key and saves, which is idempotent by
      construction.

    So `concurrency.single_flight` is deliberately NOT used. It is the weaker guard for this job —
    advisory, non-blocking, released the instant the block ends — and the authoritative claim
    already lives inside `resume_run`, one layer down. Wrapping a second lock around it would be
    the parallel guard that makes two mechanisms disagree about who won.

    **Admission is inherited too, with one measured exception — see the module note below.** Every
    fire reaching here passed `firepath.evaluate`'s full walk in `service.tick` (incident, screen,
    spacing, rate, quiet, duty, budget, claim, slot, active, yield, capability), because `tick`
    only builds a `DueFire` for an ALLOWED decision. A resume therefore inherits every admission
    check a start gets; the single deliberate asymmetry is `droppable`, and that is not an
    admission bypass — the overlap admission is the `claim` gate, which already ran.

    🔴 **THE SIDE-EFFECT BOUNDARY, drawn explicitly because HOLD makes it load-bearing**
    (WF2AUT-13). A held envelope is retried on a later tick. That is right for a failure that
    happened before anything observable, and it is data corruption for one that happened after —
    the double-fire §3.2/criterion 7 bans. So the boundary is the `emit_event(...)` call itself,
    and the split is enforced structurally by two separate `try` blocks rather than by a comment:

    * **Above the line** the function only reads the envelope, builds keyword arguments and resolves
      the engine. Nothing there can fire a trigger, write a ledger row or touch a store, so a
      failure there provably delivered nothing and is honestly retryable.
    * **Below the line** the envelope is DELIVERED, full stop, whatever happens next. `emit_event`
      matches every stored trigger and schedules their actions; once entered, the drain cannot know
      how far it got, and "I don't know" must resolve to delivered rather than to a retry.

    `get_engine()` is resolved as the LAST pre-flight step, immediately above the boundary, and that
    placement is the point: it is a pure lazy constructor (its store is bound on first use, not
    here), so asking for it is side-effect-free, and asking BEFORE the boundary converts "the event
    engine is not reachable" from a fact `emit_event` swallows into a `logger.debug` — silently
    losing every spooled fire — into a pre-delivery TRANSIENT that earns a bounded retry.

    Re-entry stays through `emit_event`, the SAME seam a live source write uses, not a second
    dispatch path: that is what stops a spooled fire skipping a gate a live one walks, which is
    exactly how the `web_watch` screen gap (S134) opened.

    spool is only truncated after the envelopes have been handed on, so a crash mid-drain re-drains
    rather than losing them. `clear_spool(handled=...)` keeps whatever arrived during the drain.

    🔴 **§3.3's cursor rule had a complete decision layer and no caller** (WF2AUT-13). `Handling`,
    `DrainAction`, `drain_decision` and `classify_handler_outcome` were written, documented and unit
    tested; `grep` found zero production references to any of them. Meanwhile this loop did
    `handled += 1` unconditionally and this very comment block said the alternative would be "the
    poison pill `drain_decision` names" — naming the function it never called. So the retry/hold
    policy, its bounded budget and the poison-pill give-up were all inert, and a transient re-entry
    failure was swallowed as a delivered fire.

    This is the call site. Each envelope is classified at the side-effect boundary
    (`_reenter_spooled`), `drain_decision` turns that into a `DrainAction`, and every member has a
    branch below with a raising tail so a new one cannot inherit another's semantics.

    **At-most-once is preserved, not traded.** HOLD is head-of-line (see `clear_spool`'s prefix-ack
    note) and only ever reachable from a pre-delivery failure, so nothing whose side effect may have
