"""The one clock loop: tick → dispatch → execute (§3 / §3.1 — S100).

**🔴 THE CUTOVER, and what measuring made unavoidable.** Until this session
`ScheduleService._arm_timer`
was the ONLY thing that fired a clock trigger. S88 shipped `service.tick()`, S96 taught it to arm,
S97 made `overlap` enforce, S98 imported the crons and S99 re-pointed the API's read — but no loop
ever CALLED the tick. Measured directly:

    boot starts ScheduleService: True
    boot starts a TICK loop    : False

So a trigger created the new way (store only, as `tools.create` writes it) had **no firing path at
all**: the legacy service cannot see `triggers.json`, and nothing ran the engine that can.
Re-pointing
the API's writes before this would have produced silently dead automations.

**And running both loops would DOUBLE-FIRE.** Measured against the owner's real store after the boot
migration: the legacy timer would fire `['j-at','j-cron','j-every','j-seq']` and the tick would fire
`['j-at','j-cron']` — a real overlap of two live automations. So this is a switch-over, not an
addition: the tick becomes the sole clock engine and the legacy timer is **not armed**.

**What the legacy service keeps doing.** `_arm_timer` is only its firing loop; the rest of the class
is still the CRUD surface and the run-history store the API reads (verified: `_load()` + `list_runs`
work with no timer armed, `_timer_task is None`). So `ScheduleService` is still constructed and
loaded, and only its timer is retired here. Its CRUD retires when the writes re-point (the next
session), and the class itself when nothing reads it.

**The loop owns no policy.** It sleeps on `TickResult.next_sleep`, hands each fire to S89's
dispatcher and S90's executor, and releases claims through them. Every decision — due-ness,
gates, arming, retirement — already belongs to `service.tick`, so this file is a driver: what was
missing,
and nothing more.
