"""The codebase graph — a symbol index the agent queries instead of grepping blind
(CONTEXT-ECONOMY §5.5).

Finding where a function is defined and who calls it currently costs three to five
tool calls: a `grep` for the name, a `read_file` or two to see context, another grep
for callers. Each round-trip is tokens. This package answers the same question in
one call from a SQLite index built by tree-sitter.

**Fail-soft is the whole contract.** No index, an unparseable file, a missing
parser, a rebuild that runs long — every one of these degrades to "no graph", and
the agent goes back to grep/read exactly as before. The graph is an accelerator,
never a dependency. That is why nothing here raises into a caller: an indexing bug
must never be able to break a code session.

Deliberately NOT a language server: definitions, imports, and name-based
references, with no type inference, no scope resolution, and no cross-file symbol
binding. A "reference" here means "this file mentions this name", which is
grep-grade precision with graph-grade speed — honest about what it is, and enough to
replace the grep it stands in for.
