"""POSIX resource-limit helpers, guarded for platforms without the ``resource`` module.

The stdlib ``resource`` module is POSIX-only and absent on native Windows. Importing it
unconditionally at gateway boot ``ImportError``s the process before it can serve — you
cannot even reach "run it and see what breaks." This module guards the import ONCE (mirroring
:mod:`gideon._spawn_exec_shim`) and exposes the two things core needs, so every consumer
degrades through one helper instead of repeating a bare ``import resource``:

* :func:`raise_fd_limit` — raise the current process's own ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` soft limit toward
  a target, best-effort. The gateway calls it at boot because each ACP agent session uses ~6
  FDs (3 pipes) plus MCP server subprocesses and the default macOS soft limit (256) is too low.
* :func:`resource_limits_available` — whether the ``resource`` facility exists on this host,
  so ``doctor`` can report resource-limit availability honestly rather than silently.

Degradation contract (load-bearing): on a platform without ``resource`` (native Windows) NO
limit is applied and NOTHING is raised — the process boots and runs with whatever ``RLIMIT_NOFILE``
it inherited, and :func:`resource_limits_available` returns ``False``. On a POSIX host the
behaviour is byte-identical to the previous inline code: the soft limit is raised to
``min(hard, DEFAULT_FD_TARGET)`` when it is currently lower, and never above the inherited hard
cap. This never raises.
