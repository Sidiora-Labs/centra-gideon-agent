"""Suggested folder/tag organization for untagged sessions (SESSION-MANAGEMENT T2.1).

Organizing a chat is entirely manual today: someone has to open the per-session menu and
pick a folder or a tag. Nobody does that for the fiftieth chat, so sessions accumulate
untagged and the folder/tag machinery — board columns, folder groups, the search facet —
degrades into one giant undifferentiated pile. This module proposes the organization the
user would have chosen, and stops there.

Three rules are load-bearing:

* **Deterministic first.** Three signals decide the proposal without a model: title
  keywords against the existing tag/folder vocabulary, the session's ``workspace_dir``
  basename, and channel origin. A model runs ONLY when those produce nothing usable
  (:func:`propose_for_session` with ``allow_llm=True``), because the easy cases are the
  overwhelming majority and paying a roundtrip for them would be both slow and expensive.

* **Never auto-applies.** Nothing in this module writes ``folder_id`` or ``tags``.
  :func:`propose_for_session` returns a proposal and :func:`surface_proposal` raises an
  inbox row for it; the mutation happens in :func:`apply_proposal`, which is reachable
  only from an explicit user action and which delegates to the SAME endpoints the UI's own
  folder/tag controls use. A second writer for either field is the drift this project
  keeps deleting.

* **Never nags.** A proposal the user declined must not return on the next scan. The inbox
  ``dedup_key`` covers a still-open row, and a persisted decline record
  (``entity_settings/session_organize.json``) covers the resolved ones. The key includes
  the proposed VALUE, so "put this in Research" being declined does not silence a later,
  genuinely different "tag this bug" proposal for the same session.

    Both writes go through the existing owners: ``folder_id`` is validated against
    ``state._folders`` exactly as ``chat_folders.api_chat_session_folder`` does, and tag
    names resolve through ``chat_tags.find_tag_by_name`` / ``create_tag`` — the same helper
    the UI's create endpoint and the auto-tagger share, so a tag created by accepting a
    proposal is indistinguishable from a hand-made one. Persistence and the sessions
    broadcast are the same pair every other session-metadata writer uses.
