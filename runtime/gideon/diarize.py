"""Speaker diarization entry point (core L1) — parallel to ``transcribe.py``.

Resolves the active ``diarization`` provider + model and returns speaker turns, with the
same sensitive-path guard ``transcribe.py`` applies. Returns ``None`` (feature off) when no
diarization model is bound — so the audio graph's diarization + fusion nodes skip
gracefully and rich transcripts still work without a diarization model installed.
