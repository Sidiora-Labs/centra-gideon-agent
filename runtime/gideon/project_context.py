"""Project living context — the overview, the wayfinder ledgers, and the injected block (S46).

`projects.py` resolves which project work binds to. This module owns what a project KNOWS: the
living overview the engine revises as runs complete, the three wayfinder ledgers, and the context
block every session inside the project sees.

Two distinctions the plan draws normatively, held here as separate files and separate functions:

* **Overview is current state; the ledger is history.** `context/overview.md` is revised in place —
  what the project now knows. The decisions ledger is append-only — what was settled and when.
  Collapsing them would mean either losing the history or making the current state something a
  reader has to reconstruct from a log.
* **Brief is what/why; instructions are how.** The brief is user-authored and stable; the
  instructions are operating procedure. An agent that cannot tell the goal from the procedure will
  follow the procedure past the point where the goal is met.

Everything is best-effort by construction. This feeds a **context builder**, and the never-break-a-
turn contract applies: a corrupt overview file must cost the block, never the user's message.

    A listing that recommends redundant work is one an agent learns to ignore wholesale — taking the

    CONTENT-based, not name-based. A blanket exclusion on the reserved filenames looked equivalent
