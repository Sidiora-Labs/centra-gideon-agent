"""Cross-session full-text search (SESSION-MANAGEMENT §C1).

Search today is a linear scan: `ConversationLog.search_sessions` reads up to 500
session files per query and counts substrings. It works, and it silently stops
finding things once history outgrows that window. This module is the FTS5 index that
replaces it — one query against a real inverted index, with a highlighted snippet
showing *why* each session matched.

Two rules are load-bearing:

* **Restricted sessions are never indexed.** A temporary or incognito session that
  became searchable would defeat the entire point of the mode. Exclusion happens at
  the index boundary AND is re-checked at read time, because a session can be
  reclassified after its rows were written.
* **The index is disposable.** It holds no truth of its own — every row is derived
  from the JSONL transcripts, so a corrupt or missing database is repaired by
  rebuilding rather than restored. Any failure degrades to the linear scan, which
  is why nothing here raises into a caller.
