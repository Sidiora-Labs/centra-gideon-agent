"""Abstract base for diarization providers (core L1).

Diarization takes audio → speaker TURNS (time ranges tagged SPEAKER_00/01/…). It is
unsupervised (finds *distinct* speakers, not identities) and produces NO words — so it
never touches vocabulary correction. Naming the anonymous speakers is a separate, cheap
step done in the Minutes app. Mirrors the ``stt/`` provider shape so a diarization app
plugs into the ``diarization`` use-case exactly as an STT app plugs into ``stt``.
