"""Inbox sorting — the background pass that gives each new message its triage verdict.

A message reaches the Inbox unsorted (``classification`` ``""``, which the Inbox shows as "Not
sorted yet"). :class:`InboxSorter` is woken when one arrives, waits a moment for the rest of a
burst, then sends the waiting messages to the background model in batches of at most
:data:`BATCH_MAX`, one call per batch, through the prompt bound for sorting (``inbox_classify``,
Settings › Prompts). Each answer lands on its row with the prompt that produced it
(``classified_by``), which is what a verdict she gives on the row is rated against. A message the
model could not sort carries the reason (``classify_error``) until she sorts it again
(``POST /api/inbox/{id}/sort``) or sorts it herself.

What it reads, and when it waits:

* **Messages only.** A row that is not a message (a notice, a proposal, her own note) is never
  sorted and carries no verdict; nor is an agent's own post (``post_to_inbox``), whose kind the
  agent gave when it posted and whose text may come from a Temporary or Incognito chat, which no
  background pass reads.
* **Once per message.** A message is sent while it is unsorted, never again once it has a
  verdict or a failure, and one pass runs at a time. A verdict she gave while the model was
  reading is kept: the answer lands only on a row still unsorted.
* **Inside the rules every background pass keeps.** Nothing is sent while sorting is off in
  Settings › Inbox (``inbox.sort_messages``) or incident mode is on, and a call the daily spend
  ceiling refuses, or that no background model could take (none is set up, or the bound one is
  resting after failing), leaves its messages unsorted. Each is a hold: no row changes, the
  reason is the sorter's :meth:`InboxSorter.health`, and the next wake tries again.

Each message is fenced on its own (``_fence_message``) with its channel inside the
fence, so one message's text cannot read as a note about its neighbours.
