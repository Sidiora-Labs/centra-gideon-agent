"""Optional LAN discovery for companion clients (COMPANION-APPS C3 / S2).

The problem: a phone on the same Wi-Fi cannot guess ``http://192.168.1.37:10000``. Today
you read the LAN address off the machine and type it in. That works, and it keeps working
— this module never becomes a precondition for anything. It just removes the typing.

So: an **opt-in** mDNS/DNS-SD advertiser for ``_gideon._tcp.local.``, plus the
resolver a client uses to find it. Both sides speak the DNS wire format directly over a
multicast UDP socket; there is no third-party responder in the dependency set, and the
bytes that leave this machine are built here, in one function, where they can be read.

**What this deliberately does NOT do — read this before extending it:**

* **It carries no credential and no content.** The TXT record is built from a closed key
  set (:data:`_TXT_KEYS`) holding a name, a port, and two constants. A discovery packet is
  a broadcast: everything in it is public to every device on the network, forever, with no
  authentication. So it says only *"a Gideon gateway is here, and it will want you
  to pair"*. Pairing itself is the auth layer's job and is unchanged by this module.
* **It does not widen access.** Discovery tells a client *where* to knock; the token rail
  still decides *whether* it gets in. Announcing an address grants nothing — a gateway
  that was already reachable at that address is exactly as reachable afterwards.
* **It is off by default** (``companion.discovery_enabled``), because announcing a service
  on a network you do not fully control is a posture choice, not a convenience default.
* **It refuses to advertise a loopback-only gateway.** Announcing ``127.0.0.1`` to the LAN
  would publish an address that resolves, on every other device, to *that device* — a
  guaranteed-broken record, and a small lie about what this machine offers. So the
  loopback case is a no-op with a log line that says why (:func:`decide`).

Everything is best-effort by construction: a socket this module cannot open, a network
that drops multicast, a router that filters it — none of that may affect the gateway. A
failed advertiser degrades to "type the URL", which is the path that existed before.
