"""Best-of-N sampling — the core primitive (HARNESS-CRAFT §2.1, HC-3).

``best_of_n(prompt, n, judge_criteria, use_case)`` fires N **genuinely parallel**,
temperature-varied :func:`~gideon.integrations.llm_helpers.one_shot_completion` calls, has
:class:`~gideon.assurance.eval.judge.LLMJudge` score every survivor against
``judge_criteria``, and returns the winner plus the full slate (candidates +
judgments) so a caller can offer "use #2".

Why every design choice is what it is:

* **Parallel, not a loop.** N sequential calls would cost N× latency on top of the
  N× spend, which makes sampling useless for an interactive turn. The fan-out is one
  ``asyncio.gather`` over N tasks; ``tests/test_sampling_best_of_n.py`` asserts the
  in-flight count reaches N (a sequential loop peaks at 1), which no loop can fake.
* **Through the chokepoint.** Each sample rides ``one_shot_completion`` → the
  use-case bridge → :class:`~gideon.security.guardrails.model_call.ModelCallGuard`, so
  the N× cost is metered by the SpendMeter, breaker-guarded, and visible as N lines
  in ``model_calls.jsonl``. There is deliberately no raw-provider shortcut here: a
  primitive whose whole hazard IS cost must not be the one call that escapes the
  meter.
* **Temperature-varied for real.** The ladder is threaded to the provider as a
  genuine sampling parameter (``one_shot_completion(temperature=…)`` →
  ``extra_options["temperature"]`` → the request kwargs both protocol clients
  already forward). Caveat named honestly: an Anthropic model in extended-thinking
  mode *forbids* a custom temperature and drops it (``llm/anthropic.py``), so on such
  a binding the ladder collapses and candidates may come back near-identical — the
  judgment slate then simply shows a zero spread, which is exactly the signal the
  outcome log exists to surface.
* **Partial-tolerant, fail-open.** One failed sample loses that candidate, never the
  call: survivors are judged and a winner is still returned. If *all* N fail, the
  result is an explicit no-candidate envelope (``winner=None`` + ``note``) rather
  than an exception or a fabricated answer. If the judge itself is unavailable the
  slate is returned ``judged=False`` with the lowest-index survivor as winner — the
  no-model floor is "you get one answer, unjudged", never "you get nothing".
* **Deterministic selection.** The winner is ``max(score)`` with ties broken by the
  LOWEST candidate index (equivalently: sort by ``(-score, idx)`` and take the
  first). Same candidates + same judge scores ⇒ same winner, always. Unjudged
  candidates (judge errored on that one) never win over a judged one; with no
  judgments at all the lowest-index survivor wins.

Each call appends one bounded record to ``$GIDEON_HOME/sampling_outcomes.jsonl``
— ``{ts, n, criteria_digest, winner_idx, score_spread, tokens_total}``, no prompt or
candidate text — the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL / EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE feed for "did sampling
actually help, and is the spread ever meaningful for this use case?". The store is
declared ``derived`` in the durability inventory, which is what keeps it out of
snapshots (claimed, so ``audit_home()`` sees it; disposable, so it is never backed
up).
