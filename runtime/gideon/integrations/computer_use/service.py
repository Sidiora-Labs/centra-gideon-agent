"""In-gateway dispatch for desktop computer use — the chain, in order (`DCU-4`).

This module is the only place a computer-use decision is made, and
:func:`computer_dispatch` is the only dispatchable entry point in the package. Everything
else is a step it calls, in the order DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §2 lays out:

===== ============================================ ==================================
step   what                                          owner
===== ============================================ ==================================
1      keystone enable (out-of-band document)        ``enable_state.require_enabled``
2      target-app allowlist                          ``policy.check_app``
3      index freshness (TTL) + fingerprint re-walk    :func:`_require_fresh_element`
4      secure-field / sensitive-text screen           ``policy.check_input_target``
5      SEL audit — records, never decides             ``gate.require_computer_use``
6      platform driver, as a ceilinged subprocess     :func:`_run_driver`
7      re-snapshot + redact the result                :func:`_redact_result`
===== ============================================ ==================================

**Composition is this atom's deliverable, and the ORDER is the substance of it.** `DCU-2`
shipped steps 2/4/5 as three correct, tested, and provably inert functions — its own audit
censused the production callers and found zero, which is why
``tests/test_computer_use_call_sites.py`` exists. Wiring them is therefore not "add three
calls": a screen that runs after the driver has already pressed the button is not a screen, so
``test_the_chain_runs_every_screen_before_the_acting_driver_call`` records the actual sequence
at runtime and asserts it, rather than asserting that each step happened somewhere.

**Why the re-walk (step 3) is allowed to touch the driver before step 4 runs.** It is a READ,
and ``policy.check_input_target``'s own docstring requires it: the screen must see *"the
element that will be typed into, not a stale row describing something the user has since
replaced"*. So the element handed to step 4 comes from the re-walk, never from the stored
snapshot. The ordering rail states this precisely — every screen precedes the **acting** driver
call, and the only driver interaction before them is the re-walk.

**Exactly one SEL row per attempt, and the allowed path writes one too.** `DCU-2` left this
open by design: ``policy`` raises without recording, because ``gate`` is a separate step *a
caller must remember* — and this module is that caller. Every exit from the chain passes
through :func:`_audit` exactly once: a refusal records ``outcome="denied"`` with the refusal's
stable code, and an approved attempt records ``outcome="approved"`` **before** the driver runs.
Before, not after, for the reason the plan puts the audit at step 5: a driver that wedges, is
killed by its ceiling, or crashes the machine must still have left evidence that the attempt
was made and permitted. The consequence is deliberate — the row records the *verdict*, not the
outcome of the action, and a driver failure is reported to the caller rather than written as a
second row. One attempt, one row, so "every attempt is audited" stays countable.

**The driver is a subprocess, not an import.** §3.5 requires the driver to run as a ceilinged
spawn so *"a wedged/looping driver is bounded by the kernel, not just a userspace timeout"*.
`DCU-3` will ship the macOS accessibility FFI; this atom ships the harness it runs inside —
:mod:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.driver_host`, spawned through
``sandbox.create_subprocess_limited`` (the one seam that carries the resource ceiling) with a
userspace timeout on top. Today that child answers every operation with a typed
"no accessibility driver for this platform" refusal, which is an honest refusal reached through
the real spawn — not a stub the dispatch fakes on the driver's behalf.

    no", and this one means "the request is not one this chain can run" (unknown tool, missing

    tell an operator-fixable refusal from a model-fixable one — and they carry different FIX
    lines for exactly that reason. All three are discriminated by

    off — and the audit is written by the handler, which has only what the chain got as far as
    setting. Carrying it on the exception is what lets the row name its target without the
    dispatch having to guess or the helper having to return through a raise. Left ``""`` where
