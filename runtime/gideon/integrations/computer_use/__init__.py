"""Desktop computer use — driving the operator's own applications through the OS
accessibility layer (DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE).

Six modules, in the order the dispatch chain runs them:
:mod:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.enable_state` is the keystone out-of-band enable plus the
operator's target allowlist (§3 floor 1, `DCU-1`/`DCU-2`); :mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.policy`
DECIDES (steps 2 and 4 — the app allowlist and the secure-field screen);
:mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.gate` only RECORDS (step 5 — the SEL audit, which has no veto);
:mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.service` COMPOSES them into the one dispatch (`DCU-4`) and is
the only dispatchable entry point in the package; :mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.tools`
declares the seven-tool surface and is the thin stdio shim that forwards a call to that dispatch,
holding no authority and no OS handle; and :mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.driver_host` is the
ceilinged child process the platform driver runs inside. The platform drivers themselves are
later atoms (`DCU-3` macOS, `DCU-6` Windows/Linux), so every operation currently reaches a typed
"no driver for this platform" refusal — through the real spawn, never simulated. The whole
capability is OFF until an operator turns it on out-of-band.

This package intentionally re-exports nothing: a convenience alias would be a declared symbol
with a second reader, and the one thing this package cannot afford is two readers of one
decision — see ``enable_state.require_enabled``'s docstring for the measured version of that
lesson. Callers say ``from gideon.integrations.computer_use import enable_state`` instead.
