"""The computer-use tool surface, and the thin stdio shim that forwards it (`DCU-4`).

**Two things live here and nothing else: the DECLARATION of the seven tools, and the
transport that carries a call to the gateway.** No decision is made in this file. That is the
whole content of the plan's "thin shim" claim (§2): *"the OS driver needs the gateway's
policy, enable-state, and SEL — replicating those in a subprocess would fork the security
surface. The shim resolves session identity and forwards; it holds no OS handles."*

**Why "thin" has to be enforced, not asserted.** This module runs inside
``gideon mcp-core``, a separate process an ACP CLI spawns. Any screen implemented here
would be a screen the operator's *other* entry points do not get, and any screen implemented
here *as well as* in the dispatch would be two homes for one policy — the failure
``enable_state.require_enabled``'s docstring records from measurement (two readers of one
flag, and the mutation that should have reded every refusal test left them all green). So the
shim's obligations are stated as a shape a test can check:
``tests/test_computer_use_dispatch.py::test_the_shim_imports_no_driver_and_no_dispatch``
asserts by AST that this file imports neither a driver nor
:mod:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.service`, and
``test_the_shim_makes_no_policy_decision`` asserts it calls none of the three screens.

**Why the seven tools are always listed, even when the keystone is OFF.** Hiding them while
disabled is tempting — a disarmed machine would spend no tokens on tools that refuse — and it
is wrong twice. First, ``mcp_core._aggregated_call_tool`` routes a call by asking each
category module whether it *lists* the name: an empty list would make ``computer_click`` fall
through to core's own dispatch and answer "unknown tool", replacing `DCU-1`'s WHAT/WHY/FIX
refusal (which names the enable file, the exact bytes and the restart) with a dead end. The
keystone's whole done_when is *"every computer-use tool refuses with a WHAT/WHY/FIX message
pointing to the out-of-band enable step"*; a tool that cannot be reached cannot refuse
legibly. Second, a conditional tool population is a second code path whose disabled branch no
production caller ever exercises. So the surface is constant and the *answer* is what changes,
which is also the honest thing to show a model: the description says the capability is
operator-armed and off until then.

**The tool names are the plan's** (§2, "The tool surface"): ``computer_list_apps``,
``computer_snapshot``, ``computer_click``, ``computer_type``, ``computer_set_value``,
``computer_scroll``, ``computer_perform_action``. They are NOT defined here as Python
functions, deliberately: ``tests/test_computer_use_enable_state.py``'s keystone ratchet binds
every module-level ``computer_*`` *function* in this package to ``require_enabled()`` as its
first statement, and seven such functions here would be seven keystone readers in a process
that must not hold the decision at all. The dispatchable entry point is exactly one —
``service.computer_dispatch`` — and these are the names it accepts.
