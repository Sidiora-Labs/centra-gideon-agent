"""The refusal a platform Gideon *intends* to support gives before its driver exists
(`DCU-6`, §3.6).

**Why this is not the refusal :mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.driver_host` already had.** When
``resolve_driver`` finds nothing importable it answers ``ERR_COMPUTER_USE_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE``,
and that code's meaning is *this build has no driver for this platform at all* — the honest
answer for a platform outside ``DRIVER_MODULES`` entirely (FreeBSD, an unknown
``platform.system()``), and the answer for a mapped platform whose driver has no handler for the
requested operation.
Windows and Linux are a different situation and flattening the two is the dishonesty this atom
exists to remove: Gideon fully intends to drive those desktops, the accessibility API each
will use is already chosen (UIA / AT-SPI), and *no action the operator takes on that machine
changes the answer today*. So they get their own registered code, their own WHY naming the API
that is missing, and a FIX that names the one thing that does work — macOS — instead of
"nothing to configure", which reads as a shrug.

**One refusal, two platform modules.** :mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.windows_driver` and
:mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.linux_driver` exist because ``DRIVER_MODULES`` resolves a driver
by importing the module named for the platform, and because each is the file a future
implementer fills in. What they must NOT each own is the wording: two copies of a WHAT/WHY/FIX
drift the moment one is edited, and the structural-duplication ratchet counts that family for
exactly this reason. So the sentence lives here once and is parameterised by the two facts that
genuinely differ — the platform's name and the accessibility API a real driver there will use.

**Nothing in this module or its two callers touches the OS.** They import cleanly on every
platform, deliberately: ``resolve_driver`` runs *inside the gateway's own process*, so a driver
module that raised at import time on the wrong OS would turn "this machine has no desktop
capability" into "this machine has no gateway". ``macos_ffi``'s no-framework-at-import rail
makes the same promise for the driver that does call an OS; here it is free, and
``test_computer_use_unsupported_platforms.py`` pins it so a future real driver cannot quietly
put a ``import comtypes`` at the top of ``windows_driver`` and take the gateway down on macOS.
