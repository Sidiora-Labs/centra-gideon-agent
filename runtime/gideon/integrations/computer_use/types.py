"""The platform-neutral vocabulary every accessibility driver speaks (`DCU-3`, §2).

One element shape, one fingerprint definition, one error envelope — shared by the macOS driver
today and by the Windows/Linux drivers `DCU-6` will add. The alternative, each driver inventing
its own dictionary keys, would put the dispatch's secure-field screen
(:func:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.policy.check_input_target`) at the mercy of whichever driver
answered: that screen reads ``role``/``subrole``/label/value keys off the element, so a driver
that spelled them differently would be screened against nothing and would pass.

**Every text field is a ``str``, never ``None``.** ``check_input_target`` refuses a screened key
whose value is not a string ("a driver that hands a list where a role goes has produced a target
this build does not understand"), so an absent title must serialise as ``""`` rather than as
``null``. :meth:`Element.to_dict` is the single place that guarantees it, which is why drivers
build :class:`Element` instances instead of assembling dictionaries by hand.
