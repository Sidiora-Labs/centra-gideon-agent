"""The cursor-motion overlay's data source — observation of acting calls (`DCU-7`, §3.7).

**This module GRANTS NOTHING.** DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §3 floor 7 is the whole spec: *"The
human-facing views grant nothing: … an optional cursor-motion overlay draws a fake cursor so
a watching human sees where a click will land — it is not the real pointer and is invisible
to screen capture."* The fake cursor here is a RECORD, not a pointer: the dispatch tells this
module where an approved acting call is about to land, the record sits in a bounded
in-process buffer, and the dashboard's live view draws it. Nothing in this module can move,
click, type, walk a window, or reach a driver — ``tests/test_computer_use_live_view.py``
asserts that by AST, the same way the shim's thinness is asserted, and the capability census
(`test_the_tool_surface_is_unchanged_with_the_views_on`) pins that turning the views on
changes the tool surface not at all.

**Why the fake cursor is drawn in the dashboard rather than on the desktop.** The plan's
"invisible to screen capture" clause is a constraint, not a technique: the overlay must never
contaminate what the agent (or any capture of the driven desktop) can see. Drawing it in the
operator's browser satisfies that by construction — the marker exposes no accessibility
element for ``computer_snapshot`` to index and paints no pixel on the driven display — where
a native always-on-top window would have to *earn* the invisibility (`NSWindowSharingNone`)
and would be this package's second OS-drawing surface for zero capability payoff. The
dashboard is also where the watching human already is. Recorded as a deviation in the plan's
execution log, because the plan's PiP phrasing predates `DCU-3`'s decision to read
accessibility trees rather than capture pixels.

**Why observing cannot refuse, and cannot raise.** The observation runs inside
:func:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.service.computer_dispatch`, between the approved SEL row and
the acting driver call — before the action lands, which is what makes "sees where a click
WILL land" the true tense. A view seam that can raise there is a decision-maker by accident
(the same reasoning as :func:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.gate.require_computer_use`): a malformed
element would turn "show the human" into "refuse the drive". So :func:`observe_action`
swallows everything and returns ``None`` on any input.

**Why the buffer may hold window text the SEL may not.** :mod:`gate`'s shape-summary rule
exists because the SEL is *persisted* — a window title written there sits on disk forever.
This trail is process-local, bounded at :data:`MAX_TRAIL`, never persisted, and rendered only
to the operator whose own desktop it describes. The one rule it inherits is the model's:
every string is passed through :func:`gideon.security.security.redact_credentials` on the way
in, so the view mirrors at most what the dispatch would hand the model, never more.
