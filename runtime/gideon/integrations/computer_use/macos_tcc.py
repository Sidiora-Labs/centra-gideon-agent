"""Which process macOS actually attributes an Accessibility request to (`DCU-3`, #2569).

**The principal is not the binary that asked.** macOS resolves a TCC request against the
*responsible* process — the application that launched the interpreter — and not against the
executable that called ``AXIsProcessTrusted()``. So the identity System Settings is asking
about is the terminal emulator, IDE or app bundle hosting the gateway, and the grant is a
property of **that** process rather than of the machine or of the python binary.

Measured on one workstation, same python, three hours apart::

    09:51  binary_path=.../uv/python/cpython-3.13.14-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.13
           responsible=com.amazon.kiro.crew  (.../KiroCrew.app/Contents/MacOS/KiroCrew)  -> granted
    18:38  binary_path=.../uv/python/cpython-3.13.14-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.13
           responsible=dev.warp.Warp-Stable  (/Applications/Warp.app/Contents/MacOS/stable)
           AUTHREQ_RESULT: authValue=0                                                    -> denied

That is why this module exists and why it is not part of
:mod:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.macos_ffi`. There is no accessibility API that reports the
responsible process, so this is not an FFI call at all: ``tccd`` writes the attribution it used
into the unified log, and reading it back is the only way to *name* the principal an operator
must tick. The query is the one PR #2572 used to measure the two sessions above, kept as one
:data:`RESPONSIBLE_PROBE_COMMAND` string so the refusal, the two live validators and an
operator at a prompt are all reading the same thing.

**It reports, and it never guesses.** The probe is scoped to this process's own pid: an
``AUTHREQ_ATTRIBUTION`` row belonging to some other application is worse than no answer,
because it would send the operator to grant something unrelated with full confidence. Every
failure — no ``log`` binary, a slow log store, a window with no row for this pid — returns a
:class:`Responsible` that says it is unknown *and why*, so the caller can say so rather than
fall back on a plausible name.

**It is bounded, because its caller is, and the two callers have different deadlines.**
``service._run_driver`` gives the driver child
:data:`~gideon.integrations.computer_use.service.DRIVER_TIMEOUT_SECS` (20s) to answer, and a refusal's
probe runs inside that budget. ``log show``'s cost is the *host's* — measured on one workstation
at 3.5s, 6.7s and 23s within the same hour, and driven by the machine's log archive rather than
by the window asked for. So a refusal gets :data:`PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS` and no more (a slow log
store must not convert an operator-fixable permission refusal into a driver timeout, which would
lose the very FIX line this module exists to write), while a caller with nothing waiting on it —
the live validators, whose whole job is to record which principal they measured — passes
:data:`PATIENT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS`. One number cannot serve both.
