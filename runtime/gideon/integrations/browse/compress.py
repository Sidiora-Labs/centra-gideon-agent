"""Context compression layer — the ~20x token reduction that makes autonomous browse viable
(plan amendment 2026-07-26(a), "Context compression layer + task A1").

The measured problem: raw DOM is ~100K+ tokens; a browse node cannot afford to put that in a
model's context every step. This module sits between the (structural) extraction and the
agent's prompt and produces a ``PageOutline`` — a compact, ref-addressable representation that
fits under a small token budget:

  * the ≤4000-char text body, further trimmed to the outline's own budget;
  * the interactive elements (links + form fields) as ref lines — the surface the agent acts
    on, which is what a text-only representation is *for*;
  * a **screenshot referenced by PATH only** — ``[SCREENSHOT: <path>]``. A screenshot is
    captured per step for verification, but it enters context as a path placeholder, NEVER as
    a ``data:image`` base64 blob. Inlining even one base64 screenshot would blow the entire
    token budget this layer exists to defend (a single 1MP PNG is ~1MB → ~350K tokens of
    base64) and defeats the point. ``assert_no_base64`` is the belt-and-suspenders guard the
    regression test drives.

Token counting reuses ``learning.surfacing.count_tokens`` (tiktoken when installed, char/4
otherwise) so the "<1K tokens" contract is measured with the SAME estimator the rest of the
codebase budgets against — not a second, divergent counter.
