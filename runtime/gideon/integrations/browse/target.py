"""WHICH browser a browse task drives — the execution-target selector (BA-7, plan §(a)/§(d)).

Two targets, one closed vocabulary:

* ``gateway`` (the DEFAULT) — the shipped §5 path: a CDP page target named on the action
  config, running under the gateway's own per-site profile. Absent a ``target`` key this is
  what a config resolves to, so every browse action authored before this module existed
  keeps the behaviour it had.
* ``user_browser`` — the operator's OWN browser, reached through the connector registered
  below. It inherits the sessions the operator is already logged into, which is exactly why
  it carries the two refusals this module exists to make unavoidable.

**The two refusals, and why they are not one.**

1. **No silent fallback.** A ``user_browser`` task with no connector returns
   ``outcome="skip"`` and a typed reason. It must NEVER quietly run on the gateway profile
   instead: the gateway's profile is a *different identity* — different cookies, different
   logins, different credentials — so "fell back" would run work the operator scoped to
   their own session against an account they did not name. The mechanism that makes that
   structural rather than a promise is :func:`resolve_cdp_url`: the ``user_browser`` branch
   reads its endpoint from the CONNECTOR and never from ``action_config["cdp_url"]``, so
   there is no code path along which the gateway's target can be reached by a task that
   asked for the user's browser.
2. **Never unattended.** Per AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS' earned-autonomy ladder the ``user_browser``
   target sits at a floor that no evidence promotes: driving a browser that is already
   logged into the operator's bank while nobody is watching is not a rung, it is a category
   the ladder does not contain. So this is expressed as a construction-level refusal rather
   than a fifth rung name — see :func:`permits_unattended` and
   :func:`unattended_refusal`. The provider ``browse`` remains registered at
   ``one_tap``/``one_tap`` in ``guardrails.rungs`` (that spec is read, not restructured,
   here); ``tests/test_browse_target.py`` rails its ceiling so a later session cannot
   promote the provider to an unattended rung underneath this floor.

**Where each refusal is consulted.** The unattended refusal fires at REGISTRATION
(``triggers.tools.create``/``update`` — every trigger fire is unattended by construction,
see ``gateway._background_write_surface``) *and* at the call site inside
``BrowseActionProvider.execute``, because a gate placed one level away from the work is
bypassed by the next caller that brings its own plumbing. The connector refusal can only be
answered at run time — whether a browser is attached is not knowable when a row is saved.
