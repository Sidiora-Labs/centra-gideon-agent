"""Per-task browser-grant flow — BA-9 (plan §(c): per-task authorization IS the security control).

The ``user_browser`` target (BA-7) drives the operator's OWN, already-logged-in browser, so its
authorization is NOT the earned-autonomy ladder (which governs unattended trust) but a fresh,
explicit, per-TASK grant a human answers while watching. This module owns that grant lifecycle
end to end:

* :func:`request_grant` — one task, one authorization, routed through the SHIPPED fail-closed
  :class:`~gideon.engine.agents.native.approval.ApprovalGate`. No answer in :data:`GRANT_TIMEOUT`
  → REJECT; a gate that is absent, or that raises, → REJECT. It NEVER fails open: a
  ``user_browser`` run that cannot prove a human authorized it does not touch the browser.
* :func:`task_group_name` — the run's tabs live in a group named after the task, so the human sees
  WHAT they authorized and can click in to take over. Core owns only the NAME and the close
  CONTRACT; the tabs and the ``close`` verb live in the BA-8 extension (apps repo).
* :func:`make_close_check` — closing that tab group is a HARD STOP, OBSERVED not requested. The
  extension turns a close into a connector disconnect (or a re-attach as a different session);
  this returns ``(True, reason)`` the moment the live connector is no longer the one the grant was
  bound to, so :func:`~gideon.integrations.browse.loop.run_browse_loop` parks within one step — the same
  per-step seam BA-5's kill switch uses. **Distinct from** :mod:`gideon.integrations.browse.killswitch`:
  that flag stops ALL unattended browse; this ends ONE attended run when its own tab closes.
* SEL audit — ``browser_grant`` at grant/deny, ``browser_revoked`` at run-end / close / kill. The
  row carries the task label, the site scope (hostnames), and a reason ONLY; NEVER a credential,
  cookie, or session token (§5.2's no-credential invariant, restated for the audit trail).

**Why a module-level gate rather than a per-session one.** A grant is keyed by a unique request
id, and one :class:`ApprovalGate` serves many concurrent request ids by construction. The browse
grant channel is therefore ONE process-global gate — the same "a live attachment is a process
property" reasoning :mod:`gideon.integrations.browse.target` uses for the connector — and
:func:`approve_grant` / :func:`reject_grant` resolve a specific pending request on it.
