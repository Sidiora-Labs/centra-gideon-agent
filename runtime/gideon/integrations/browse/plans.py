"""Persisted, idempotent scheduled-actuator browse plans (BROWSE-AUTOMATION §(d)/A3, BA-6).

A long-running browse is NOT a long-lived session — it is a **persisted plan re-executed as
stateless one-tick runs**. Each plan lives in ``browse/plans/<id>.json`` and carries a
``cursor`` that is the whole of its progress, so killing the gateway mid-flow loses at most
one step and re-firing the same tick is a no-op at the same cursor.

Two kinds (§(d)):

* ``watch_page`` — one tick re-extracts the page and diffs the content against the cursor.
  A tick that sees the same content reports no change and leaves the cursor untouched; the
  cursor is the last content hash, so the operation is idempotent by construction.
* ``walk_flow`` — one step per tick. The cursor (a step index) advances ONLY on a verified
  success, so a crash between the browser action and the cursor write re-runs the same step
  rather than skipping it, and a plan that never verifies never advances.

**Autonomy floor (§(d) rung cap).** The ``action.browse`` PROVIDER sits at ``one_tap`` on the
earned-autonomy ladder; the floor for a persisted PLAN is decided here, per plan:

* A read-only ``watch_page`` plan may graduate up the ladder (its floor is ``one_tap``).
* A ``walk_flow`` plan that can SUBMIT registers ``floor=draft_only`` — it cannot run
  unattended until its type earns promotion, because a SUBMIT is an irreversible external
  write with no undo handle.
* A plan naming the ``user_browser`` target is refused at REGISTRATION with a typed error:
  that target's floor never permits unattended execution (:func:`target.permits_unattended`),
  so a scheduled tick, cron, or loop could never legally drive it — catching it at
  registration turns a run-time refusal into a configuration error the author sees at once.
