"""Per-site browser profiles and the ``request_login`` handoff (BA-4, plan §5.1/§5.2/§5.3).

The handoff is the *positive* half of the invariant :mod:`gideon.integrations.browse.credentials` enforces
negatively. That module makes it impossible for the agent to read or write a credential; this one
gives the user somewhere to put one. Without both, the invariant is just a feature that does not
work: an agent that cannot type a password and has no other way to authenticate simply fails on
every logged-in site.

**The shape, and why each piece is where it is.**

*A persistent profile per site* (§5.1) at ``$GIDEON_HOME/browse/profiles/<site_slug>/``. Per
SITE rather than one shared profile because a single profile is a single identity: a run scoped to
one account would carry every other site's live session with it, and one site's tracking cookie
would follow the agent everywhere. The slug is derived from the host by :func:`site_slug`, which is
the only place a URL becomes a path — see its docstring for why that matters.

*The profile is machine-local state, NOT config and NOT entity state.* This was the one real design
question in BA-4 and it is worth recording the answer rather than the conclusion. A Chrome
``user-data-dir`` is an opaque, unbounded, live-session blob: it holds the cookies that ARE the
authentication. It is not config (nothing in it is a decision the user expressed, and no
round-trippable field describes it), and it is not entity state (it is not a fact about a person
or a project — it is a fact about *this machine's browser*). So it lives as a profile directory, and
``durability/inventory.py`` claims ``browse`` in :data:`~gideon.operations.durability.inventory.IGNORED`
rather than as a ``secret=True`` entry. That distinction is load-bearing: a ``secret`` entry is
excluded from EXPORTS but *deliberately captured by snapshots* so a backup can restore the
credential store, whereas an IGNORED path never travels at all. A snapshot is restored onto another
machine — carrying a live authenticated browser session there plants a credential on a host the user
never logged in from. It is the same reasoning ``IGNORED`` already records for ``session_key`` and
``sessions.json``, and §5.1's "never backed up by snapshot/portability, never exported" is precisely
that posture.

*The park goes through the SHIPPED needs-input gate.* :func:`request_login` builds a
:class:`~gideon.automation.workflows.needs_input.NeedsInputItem` and a sentence; it does NOT invent a
second park/resume. The browse loop parks with :data:`PARK_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, the provider maps any
park to ``outcome="needs_input"``, the engine's action-node dispatch maps that to a WAITING
instance, and ``workflows/attention.py`` fires the inbox item — the path BA-3 already relies on for
step/budget exhaustion. A credential handoff is not a new kind of waiting.

*The session check is a heuristic and says so* (§5.3). :func:`session_state` answers from the
profile's own ``.meta.json`` — cheap, offline, and honest about being a guess. A definitive answer
requires loading an authenticated-only URL and watching for a redirect to a login page, which the
loop can only do once it has a browser; the meta answer is what lets the provider decide *before*
spending a model call. When it says ``EXPIRED`` the run parks before it starts, which is the whole
point of §5.3: a mid-task interruption wastes every step already paid for.
