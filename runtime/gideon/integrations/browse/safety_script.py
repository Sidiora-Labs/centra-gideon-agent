"""Per-page safety script for the autonomous browse loop (BROWSE-AUTOMATION BA-2, §3/§4).

This module is a **pure builder**: it emits a JavaScript source STRING and nothing else. It
makes no network call, launches no browser and reads no config — the package invariant stated
in ``gideon/browse/__init__.py``. A sibling atom injects the string via CDP
``Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument``; no CDP code lives here.

Why the script exists
---------------------
The egress pre-flight in front of ``Page.navigate`` decides *which URL the agent opens*. It
cannot constrain what that page then does on its own: its ``fetch()``, an autoplaying video, a
``navigator.bluetooth`` prompt. This script is the in-page half of that gap (the plan's "§6.3
headless bypass gap"). The bar it has to clear: **a page must not be able to reach the network,
play media, or touch the user's devices behind the agent's back.**

``fetch()``: rejected, not a synthetic blocked ``Response``
----------------------------------------------------------
Both shapes stop the packet, so the choice is about what the *page* and the *agent* then see.
We reject, with a named ``GideonBlockedError``, because:

* A rejection is the failure ``fetch()`` **already** produces for a network error, so the
  page's existing ``.catch()`` path handles it. A resolved-but-synthetic ``403`` is the
  unusual shape: callers branch on ``res.ok``, often by retrying, which turns one blocked
  request into a hot loop against the guard.
* Decisively: a synthetic ``Response`` is *fabricated content*. The agent reads the page after
  the page reads that response, so a fake body can end up in the agent's own perception as if
  it were real. A rejection can never be mistaken for data.
* The named error is greppable in the console, which is where an operator looks to find out
  what the page wanted — the legibility the blocked-response option is usually argued for.

The residual cost is accepted and real: a page that treats a fetch rejection as fatal renders
an error state. That is the *better* outcome here — the agent's next snapshot shows the error
instead of silently proceeding on invented data.

Every guard therefore speaks one vocabulary: ``GideonBlockedError`` for the throw/reject
paths, and ``sendBeacon`` returning ``false`` (its own spec-shaped failure — callers never wrap
it, so throwing there would break pages for no gain).

What is COVERED
---------------
Network paths (each honours ``allow_hosts``, except where noted):

* ``window.fetch`` — rejects.
* ``XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open`` **and** ``.send`` — both, so an XHR holding a pre-injection
  ``open`` reference still cannot put bytes on the wire. ``send`` demands a stamp that only our
  ``open`` adds, in a closure-held ``WeakSet`` a page cannot write to.
* ``WebSocket`` / ``EventSource`` constructors — throw.
* ``navigator.sendBeacon`` — returns ``false``.
* ``Worker`` / ``SharedWorker`` constructors — throw, with **no allow-list carve-out**. A
  worker runs in a realm this script is not injected into at all
  (``addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`` covers documents, not worker globals), so any worker —
  even one whose script came from an allowed host — would get a pristine ``fetch``/``XHR``. The
  constructor is the only in-page chokepoint, so it closes unconditionally.
* ``RTCPeerConnection`` (+ vendor aliases) — throws, also unconditionally: it is both an
  exfiltration path and a local-IP leak.
* ``navigator.serviceWorker.register`` — rejects, unconditionally: a service worker outlives
  the page and runs in its own realm.

Media: ``HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play`` returns a rejected promise — which is exactly what
a browser returns when it blocks autoplay (``NotAllowedError``), so every player already has
that catch path.

Device / sensor / location / capture / clipboard: ``bluetooth``, ``usb``, ``serial``, ``hid``,
``geolocation``, ``mediaDevices``, ``xr``, ``clipboard``. The clause names only bluetooth; we
widened deliberately, because a guard that closes ``navigator.bluetooth`` and leaves
``navigator.usb`` open is a control with a hole in it. ``clipboard`` is in the list because
reading the user's clipboard is a real leak on the user's own machine.

Two mechanism choices there, both load-bearing:

* They are defined as ``undefined``, not as a throwing getter. ``if (navigator.bluetooth)`` is
  the near-universal feature-detection idiom; a throwing getter turns that into an uncaught
  error that takes the page's script down and *hides* what the page wanted. ``undefined`` is a
  state real browsers genuinely produce (Safari has no ``navigator.bluetooth``).
* They are defined on ``Navigator.prototype``, not on the ``navigator`` instance. An own
  property on the instance merely *shadows* the real accessor, and
  ``Reflect.get(Navigator.prototype, name, navigator)`` recovers it. Measured: unguarded, that
  ``Reflect.get`` yields an ``object``; guarded, it yields ``undefined``.

They are defined whether or not the engine currently exposes the API, which matters more than
it looks: these attributes are ``[SecureContext]``, so the *same browser* exposes none of them
on a ``data:``/plain-http page and all of them on ``https:`` or ``http://127.0.0.1``. A guard
that only hardened what it found would silently do nothing on the insecure page and then be
absent when the loop navigated somewhere secure.

What is NOT covered — the enumerated gap
----------------------------------------
An unenumerated gap is a false sense of safety, so:

1. **Markup- and CSS-driven subresource loads.** ``<img src>``, ``<script src>``,
   ``<link rel=stylesheet/preload/prefetch>``, ``<iframe src>``, ``<video src>``, CSS
   ``url()``, ``@font-face``, form submission, and navigation itself are the *browser's*
   fetches, not JS APIs, so no in-page script can intercept them. This is the biggest gap by
   far and it is structural: closing it needs the CDP network layer
   (``Network.setBlockedURLs`` / ``Fetch.enable`` request interception) or an injected CSP.
   Media bytes reached via ``el.src = …`` / ``el.load()`` fall in here too — we close
   ``play()``, not the fetch of the media resource.
2. **``WebTransport``**, ``navigator.getGamepads()``, ``navigator.credentials`` (WebAuthn — its
   risk is a *prompt*, which is auto-dismissed headlessly, and blocking it breaks legitimate
   logins the agent may need), ``navigator.permissions``, ``Notification``, the sensor
   constructors (``Accelerometer`` &c. — permission-gated and absent headlessly), and
   ``AudioContext`` (can synthesise audio without an ``HTMLMediaElement``; not a network path,
   and headless has no audio device).
3. **An already-registered service worker** from a persisted profile can intercept before our
   guard exists. Drive the browser with an ephemeral profile.
4. **Anything a page captured before this script ran.** See below.

Re-assignment: the residual limit
---------------------------------
Every guard is installed with ``Object.defineProperty`` as ``writable: false,
configurable: false``, so ``window.fetch = savedFetch`` fails silently in sloppy mode and
throws in strict mode, ``Object.defineProperty`` over it throws, and ``delete`` fails. What
that does **not** buy:

* **A page that already holds a reference to the real function cannot be stopped.** That is
  precisely why the injection point is ``Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`` (runs before
  any page script in the document) and *not* ``Runtime.evaluate`` (runs after, by which time
  the page may have stashed ``const f = fetch``). The injection mechanism, not the property
  descriptor, is what closes this.
* **A fresh realm has a fresh, unguarded copy of everything.** A same-origin ``<iframe>`` is a
  new document, so whether it is guarded depends on the injection covering child frames.
  Measured on Chromium 1234 via raw CDP: ``addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`` **does** run in
  child frames, including ``srcdoc`` and ``about:blank`` ones, so ``frame.contentWindow.fetch``
  is guarded — ``tests/test_browse_safety_script.py`` asserts this against a live browser so a
  future engine change that silently reopens the hole reds CI rather than passing quietly.
* A page can still detect the guard (a non-configurable ``fetch`` that always rejects is a
  giveaway, and ``toString()`` shows the source). Full stealth (§4) and a hard in-page policy
  guard are in tension by construction: §4 can hide the *automation*, not the *policy*. The
  ``window.__gideonSafety`` marker is therefore non-enumerable but not secret; it adds no
  new class of detectability, and it is what makes "the injection actually took" assertable.

Never throws during injection
-----------------------------
A script that errors leaves the page **unguarded while looking injected**. So each guard runs
inside a ``step()`` that records ``applied`` / ``skipped`` / ``failed``, the whole body is
wrapped, and the outermost layer swallows. Silence is not evidence, so the script publishes
``window.__gideonSafety = {version, applied, skipped, failed, allowHosts}`` (frozen,
non-enumerable, non-configurable) as the assertable proof that it ran and what it managed to
install. An absent marker, or a non-empty ``failed``, means the page is not guarded.
