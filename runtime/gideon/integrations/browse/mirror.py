"""The browse mirror relay — the domain-side helpers that reach a watching human (BA-5).

Three relays, one module, because they are the three ways the browse loop reaches a watching
human and they share exactly one dependency — the live :class:`ConsoleState`, resolved here in
one place (:func:`_resolve_state`):

* **The live mirror relay.** :func:`broadcast_browse_step` turns one loop step into a
  ``browse_step`` WS frame ``{run_id, url, action, screenshot, step_n, note}``. The provider's
  per-step sink calls it; a human watches the run advance in the ``BrowseMirror`` panel. Read-only
  — it relays artifacts the loop already produces (screened URL, rendered action, screenshot path),
  opens no debug port and exposes no CDP, so it adds no attack surface.

* **The kill switch broadcast.** :func:`broadcast_kill` relays a kill-switch state change so the
  panel updates without waiting for its next poll. The ``/api/browse/kill`` routes that engage the
  switch call it; the switch itself lives in :mod:`gideon.integrations.browse.killswitch`.

* **The auth_needed surfacing.** :func:`surface_auth_expired` runs at the moment
  ``handoff.mark_expired`` writes ``auth_state=expired``: it raises a persistent banner (a
  ``browse_auth_expired`` frame + the ``GET /api/browse/status`` read the banner polls) and a
  durable ``needs_input`` inbox item, deduped per site so a scheduled watcher that re-hits the wall
  every tick does not stack a row per tick.

**Why this is a ``browse`` module and not a ``dashboard`` handler.** These relays are called from
the domain — the action provider's per-step sink and its login park — so they must sit BELOW the
HTTP surface, not in it: a domain module that imports ``dashboard/`` inverts the layer order (the
``core-must-not-import-the-http-surface`` structural rail) and makes browse unexercisable without
standing up the web app. The aiohttp routes that also drive these relays
(:mod:`gideon.interfaces.dashboard.handlers.browse_mirror`) import DOWN into this module instead, which
is the allowed direction.

Everything here is BEST-EFFORT toward the live state: the state is resolved through
:func:`gideon.integrations.inbox_providers.native_source.get_dashboard_state`, and when no gateway is up
(a CLI context, a unit test) the broadcasts no-op rather than raise. Losing a UI relay must never
break a browse run.
