"""Gated CDP navigation for the browse loop (BA-2).

A headless browser does its own DNS and its own connections, so it bypasses
``net/client.py``'s IP-pinning SSRF guard entirely (``web/render.py``'s docstring says the
same thing about Playwright, and names redirects as its residual gap). This module is the
chokepoint that closes that hole for the CDP path: **every** navigation goes through
``net/guard.py:evaluate`` against the BROWSE profile BEFORE a ``Page.navigate`` message is
written to the wire, and a client-side redirect is re-judged when the browser reports it.

Three properties, in the order that makes them properties rather than logging:

1. **Pre-flight, not post-mortem.** :meth:`GatedCdpSession.navigate` evaluates first and
   returns without sending ``Page.navigate`` on a deny. A decision taken after the message
   is sent is not a gate, so the transport is injectable and the test asserts on the
   recorded wire messages (zero ``Page.navigate``), never on a return value.
2. **The in-page guard is installed before the first document.**
   ``Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`` is registered during :meth:`start`; a session
   that never started refuses to navigate, because the alternative is one page loading
   unguarded.
3. **A redirect the pre-flight never saw is re-judged.** ``location = …``, a meta refresh
   and a 302 chain all land the browser somewhere the pre-flight did not authorise. Every
   ``Page.frameNavigated`` is re-evaluated, and a denied one is **torn down** (see
   :meth:`GatedCdpSession._enforce`), not merely logged.

Everything fails CLOSED. An unparseable URL, a missing BROWSE profile, a guard that raises,
a transport that raises, an enforcement that cannot be delivered — none of them end in
"navigated anyway"; the worst case is a quarantined session that refuses to navigate at
all. The one deliberate fail-OPEN is the audit: a SEL write that raises must not turn a
deny into a navigation.

Residual gaps, stated rather than papered over:

* **DNS rebind.** The guard pins the resolved IPs, but CDP has no per-navigation "dial this
  IP" parameter — the browser resolves again itself. :attr:`NavigationOutcome.pinned_ips`
  carries the pinned set out so the launcher can pass Chrome's ``--host-resolver-rules``;
  wiring that belongs to BA-2's launcher scope, not here.
* **Subresources.** An image, an XHR or a WebSocket is not a navigation and produces no
  ``Page.frameNavigated``. Those are the in-page guard script's job (and, later, the
  ``Fetch``/``Network`` interception domains) — not this module's.
