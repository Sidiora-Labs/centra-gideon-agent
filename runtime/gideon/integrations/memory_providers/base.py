"""The Memory Provider contract (L2) — the real seam: record CRUD + vector ops.

A provider is the **dumb, swappable persistence layer**: it stores and queries
``MemoryRecord`` rows and (optionally) their vectors, appends the reversible
event log, and declares its capabilities. It owns NO intelligence — supersession,
promotion, recall ranking, the L1 manifest, lessons, facet derivation, lint, and
any prompt-shaped string live in the Memory Service (L3). This mirrors how a
``KnowledgeProvider`` sources/persists items while the Knowledge platform service
runs insights/embedding/retrieval over every item regardless of source
(memory-architecture.md §2/§3.2).

Clean break: the old content-shaped ABC (read_preferences/read_projects/
read_history/get_context/search) is GONE — those were a filesystem-document shape
inherited from an earlier lineage. They are not aliased; the Memory Service
renders preferences/projects/history by querying ``kind=preference|note`` records
and projecting them (mem-fs-mirror), so there is one source of truth.
