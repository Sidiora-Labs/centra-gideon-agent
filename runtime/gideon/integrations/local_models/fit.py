"""Hardware-aware model fit — ONE memory budget, ONE verdict (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 §9).

Before this module the host facts a fit answer needs were collected in three unrelated
places: system memory in :mod:`gideon.integrations.local_models.residency`, the GPU/VRAM probe in
the system-metrics handler, and free disk inline at whichever call site happened to need
it. Three collectors mean three answers, and a fit chip that disagrees with the download
panel is worse than no chip at all — so every host fact is gathered here, once, and every
fit question is answered by :func:`fit_verdict` reading :func:`usable_memory_bytes`.

The arithmetic that makes this worth centralising is the memory budget. A machine's usable
budget is NOT "system RAM plus whatever the GPU reports":

* **Unified memory** (Apple Silicon, and any integrated GPU) is one pool the CPU and GPU
  share. Adding its "VRAM" to system RAM counts the same bytes twice and reports a budget
  larger than the machine physically has — which loads a model the host cannot hold and
  OOMs at load time, after the user already waited for a multi-gigabyte download.
* Only a **discrete** GPU's VRAM is a genuinely separate pool, so only that adds.
* A fixed **reserve** for the OS and the runtime is always subtracted. A budget equal to
  total RAM is a budget that leaves nothing for the process doing the inference.

An unmeasurable host yields ``None`` (unknown), never 0 — "unknown" and "nothing fits" are
different answers and only one of them should hide models from the user.
