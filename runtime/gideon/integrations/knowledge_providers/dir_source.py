"""Watched local directories — the dir-source provider (WATCHED-SOURCES §4, am.5).

A watched directory is the one source kind whose upstream is MUTABLE: a feed appends,
but a folder of notes is edited in place, renamed, and deleted. So this provider is not a
fetcher, it is an OBSERVER: each poll takes a cheap ``(mtime, size)`` signature of every
matching file, diffs it against the signature map persisted in the source's cursor, and
reports what changed as ``created`` / ``modified`` / ``deleted`` sightings. The engine owns
what persisting each kind means (§1.1) — which is what keeps a filesystem event from ever
being able to hard-delete a library item.

**Why signatures and not ``watchdog``.** A dependency-free poll is the same trade
``triggers/file_poll.py`` already made for `file` triggers: an OS-level watcher adds a
platform-specific dependency and a per-directory thread, and still needs the signature map
for the restart case (events that fired while the process was down are simply lost). A
minute of latency on "a note changed" is invisible; a missed edit is not. ``fs_watch.py``
and ``triggers/file_watch.py`` are untouched — this is the knowledge-library path, they are
the chat/automation paths.

**Debounce is the point of the design.** An editor writes a file several times per save
(and a formatter/sync client several more), so re-indexing on first sighting would re-embed
the same note three times per keystroke burst. A changed file is therefore only emitted
once it has been QUIET for ``debounce_secs`` — and the quiet clock is the file's own
``mtime``, not the moment this loop happened to notice it. That choice matters twice: a
further edit inside the window moves ``mtime`` and so restarts the window by construction
(no timer state to keep, nothing to lose across a restart), and the file's baseline
signature is left uncommitted while it settles, so the change is simply re-observed next
pass. Three edits to one file in one window collapse to exactly one re-index; three
different files edited in one window produce exactly three — one each, never one per
intermediate signature. A vanished file has no mtime, so a delete's window is timed from
when it was first observed missing (the one piece of state the cursor carries for it).

**The first pass seeds and emits nothing.** Enrolling a directory of 4000 existing notes
must not ingest 4000 items — that is the startup storm ``WatchState.seeded`` exists to
prevent for `file` triggers, and the same rule holds here: pass one records the baseline,
and only changes AFTER it are library events.

**Save-time validation runs at POLL time too** (:meth:`validate_spec`). The spec is data in
a SQLite row that an MCP tool, an app, or a hand-edit can change after the fact, so a guard
that only ran on the create path would be one edit away from being bypassed — the same
reasoning ``pathguard`` applies to the `paths` capability. A sensitive path (credential
store, key material) is refused outright, and the file cap bounds one poll's work.
