"""The ``gideon-tool`` shim: how an agent inside a sandbox calls a host tool (§5.2).

A single static script, copied into the sandbox by the sandbox handle, that the agent invokes
like an ordinary CLI::

    gideon-tool memory_recall --query "the deploy runbook"
    gideon-tool memory_remember --text "prefers tabs"     # refused under a read-only profile

What it does not contain is the point. There is no socket, no HTTP client, no URL, no token and
no host/port — the transport is two file descriptors the HOST created before this process existed,
so possession of the fd IS the authorisation. Nothing inside the sandbox can be connected to, and
there is no credential to find:

* ``ss``/``netstat`` inside the sandbox report zero listening sockets, because nothing here binds.
* Grepping the sandbox filesystem and environment for credential material finds none, because the
  shim needs none. The only environment it reads is two integers (which fd to write, which to
  read) and an optional advertised tool list for ``--help``.

:data:`SHIM_SOURCE` is the whole program. :func:`install_shim` materialises it; an isolated
provider tier (docker/lima) copies the materialised file in through its own ``copy_file_in`` and
launches the child with the two fds inherited.
