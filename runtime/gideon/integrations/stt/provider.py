"""Abstract base for STT providers + the rich-transcript contract (core L0).

The flat ``transcribe() -> str`` is the primitive every provider implements. The rich
``transcribe_detailed() -> TranscriptResult`` is an ADDITIVE capability: a provider that
can emit segments + word timestamps overrides it and flips the capability flags; one that
can't inherits the default, which wraps its flat text in a single-field TranscriptResult.
So callers that want structure get it where available and degrade cleanly elsewhere — no
second transcription path, no provider forced to fabricate data it doesn't have.
