"""``triage-digest`` action provider — the triage pipeline's one call site.

The bundled "Morning triage" template fires ONE `action` node, and this is it. Everything the
pipeline needs that only the running gateway has — the inbox store, the live channel sessions,
the run store, the notification gate — is reached from here, so the pipeline itself stays a
pure function of an item list and two callables.

**Why an action node rather than a chain of `infer` nodes.** Three properties triage needs
are only obtainable from code:

* the zero-item short-circuit has to happen BEFORE a model is reachable, and an `infer` node is
  a model call by definition — a template that expressed the guard as a `branch` would have to
  collect in one node, and the collect stage needs live service handles;
* the ordinal contract has to be *enforced*, not requested. A prompt can ask for exact ids; only
  code can refuse a proposal that named one the manifest never minted;
* the drop and refusal rationales have to be *recorded*. `journal.step_skipped` carries no
  reason, so a model-authored gate leaves "why did nothing surface?" unanswered in the one place
  it must be answered.

**Where the filter rules live: on this node, in `action_config`.** Not in a new store. The
bundled template is copied into the user's own `defs/` the moment they instantiate it, so the
rules are editable exactly where the schedule and the capability set are, and a rule change is a
template edit the engine already versions. A parallel rules store would be a second thing to
back up and a second place "why was this dropped?" has to be looked up.

``action_config`` shape::

    {
        "filter_rules": [{"source": "inbox", "rule": "skip dependabot"}],  # optional
        "window_hours": 24,     # optional fallback when no digest has completed yet
        "max_proposals": 8      # optional; clamped to MAX_PROPOSALS
    }

**What the last digest left waiting comes with it.** The last digest that completed is read once:
the window starts where it began, and what its card still has waiting on you, checked against
each item as its lane reads it now, is carried into this one (`proactive.carry`).

Output (one JSON object, so the template can bind ``{{nodes.triage.output.*}}``) is
:meth:`TriageResult.summary`.
