"""JS-render fetch path — render a client-side page in a headless browser.

Some pages return an empty shell over HTTP and build their content with JavaScript;
the plain ``net.fetch`` path sees only the shell. ``render_url`` drives a headless
Chromium (Playwright) to execute the page's JS and returns the *rendered* HTML for the
shared extractor.

A headless browser does its own DNS + connections, so it BYPASSES ``net.fetch``'s
IP-pinning SSRF guard. To keep the egress invariant ("nothing reaches an
attacker-influenced private host"), ``render_url`` pre-validates the URL through the
SAME egress guard (``net.guard.evaluate``) BEFORE navigating — a denied URL never
reaches the browser. Redirects during navigation remain a residual gap vs the pinned
HTTP path; documented, and acceptable because this path is opt-in for known sites.

Playwright is an OPTIONAL dependency (``pip install gideon[js-render]`` +
``playwright install chromium``). When absent, ``render_url`` returns a clear
unavailable result so ``web_fetch`` degrades to the plain HTTP fetch rather than failing.
