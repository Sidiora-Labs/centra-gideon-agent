"""Per-client inbound identity and bindings (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §1.2, §10).

A request to an inbound surface authenticates as a **client**, not merely as a
surface. The surface token says "you may speak to this dialect"; the client record
says *who* is speaking and therefore *what they may reach*. That distinction is the
whole reason this module exists: with only a surface token, every holder of it is
the same principal, so revoking one integration means rotating the credential of
every other.

**Bindings are pins, not suggestions.** A client bound to ``agent: "researcher"``
cannot select another agent by putting one in the request; a client bound to
``tools: [memory_recall]`` gets exactly that in ``tools/list``. A request argument
that disagrees with a binding is a **403, SEL-logged** — never a silent
substitution and never an override. This is the account-scope rule: the binding is
the authority, the argument is an assertion, and an assertion never wins.

**The store** is ``~/.gideon/inbound_clients.json``, written with
``atomic_write(..., mode=0o600)``. It holds token *hashes* only (sha256), never a
token: a registry that could hand back the credential would make "show me the
clients" equivalent to "exfiltrate every integration's bearer".

**Lookup is constant-time** in the comparison, via ``hmac.compare_digest`` against
every candidate hash. A short-circuiting ``==`` over a dict of hashes leaks, by
timing, how many leading bytes of a guess were right — which for a hash is a
practical oracle when the attacker also controls the guess.
