"""Dialect 1 — the standard-API doorway (`/v1/*`), EXTERNAL-ACCESS §2.

Any client that already speaks the de-facto `/v1` wire shape becomes a Gideon
front-end: the `model` field names one of the user's own **agents**, and the turn runs
on this machine under the headless profile. Nothing here proxies a remote model.

Three things about this module are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

**`model` names an AGENT, and an unknown one is a 404 — not a fallback.**
``resolve_agent_bindings`` silently falls back to ``default_agent`` when handed a name
it does not know (loader.py's step 2). That is right for the dashboard and wrong here:
an external client asking for ``model="researcher"`` and quietly getting the default
agent has been answered by something it did not ask for, and it has no way to tell.
So this module checks membership in ``config.agents`` ITSELF and 404s, and only then
calls the resolver. Deleting that pre-check does not fail any obvious test — it turns
a 404 into a plausible wrong answer.

**Tool calls execute server-side and are NEVER surfaced as `tool_calls` deltas.**
The caller is not the tool executor; the headless profile is (§2.3). A dialect that
emitted `tool_calls` would be inviting the client to run Gideon's tools in the
client's own trust domain, and would hang waiting for a `tool` message that a
one-shot HTTP caller is never going to send. Tool activity therefore reaches the wire
as content, and a run that stops on an approval returns the dashboard-pointer message
with ``finish_reason: "stop"`` rather than holding the socket open for a human.

**Zero provider names in this path.** The `/v1` shapes are a protocol many vendors
implement, not one vendor's API (`docs/architecture/PROVIDER_BOUNDARY.md` says so
explicitly for `/v1/audio`). ``tts-1``/``whisper-1``/``gpt-*`` are strings CLIENTS
send; this module accepts and discards them, and resolution goes through
``active_voice_params`` / ``transcribe_audio`` / ``resolve_provider_for_use_case`` so
the user's bound local provider is the truth. `tests/test_ea2_openai_dialect.py`
greps this module for bindable vendor names and fails if one appears — with a vacuity
case proving the grep can fail — because "the alias made me name a vendor" is the
specific way this tenet dies.

Statelessness is enforced HERE rather than by adding ``inbound:`` to
``session._STATELESS_PREFIXES`` — see ``_reset_session`` for why that list is the
wrong lever and what EA-9 measured.

    one, and only falls back to a fresh ``SessionMap()``. ``SessionMap`` loads from

    instance deleting the row removes it from DISK while the gateway's long-lived
    instance keeps it in memory — and the next ``set``/shutdown writes the whole

    """Mount `/v1/*`. ``turn_runner`` is INJECTED, never imported.

    Registered UNCONDITIONALLY and refusing per request, like the capture proxy and
    unlike ``mcp_http.mount``: a mount-time gate freezes the decision at startup, so
    enabling this surface in Settings would need a gateway restart and disabling it
    would leave the route live. A disabled surface answers 404 either way, so nothing
    is disclosed by the route existing.

    Every path is fully literal, so no ``{...}`` pattern in ``dashboard/server.py``
    can shadow them.

    **Why ``turn_runner`` is a parameter.** Running a turn means calling
    ``chat_handlers._run_chat_scoped``, and importing it here would be an
    ``inbound/`` → ``dashboard/`` edge — the ``core-must-not-import-the-http-surface``
    inversion, which `scripts/gate_report.py` caught on the first draft of this module.
    The gate's rationale is the real argument, not the rule: a domain module that
    imports a handler can no longer be exercised without standing up the web app, which
    is how a feature ends up reachable through exactly one route and invisible to the
    CLI and the harness. So the composition root (``dashboard/server.py``, which
    legitimately faces downward) hands the callable in, and the dependency points the
    right way. Required keyword rather than an optional one with a fallback import: an
    optional injection point is one that silently stops being used.
