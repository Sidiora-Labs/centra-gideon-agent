"""The self-describing control bridge (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §4, atom ``EA-4``).

A *local* external agent — Claude Desktop, a validation harness, the Self-QA companion
someday — needs to drive Gideon's UI-level affordances. Without this it has two
options, and both are bad: scrape the DOM, or reach for the dashboard's own routes and
discover their shapes by trial. So the bridge exposes the FE's **semantic actions**,
typed and self-described, and lets the agent read the catalogue rather than guess it.

Four decisions in here are load-bearing, and each answers a specific failure:

**Loopback forever, `allow_remote` ignored.** Every other inbound surface can be opened
to non-loopback peers by an explicit config pair. This one cannot, by construction:
:func:`gideon.integrations.inbound.auth.peer_allowed` special-cases ``bridge`` and refuses a
remote peer whatever the config says. A control surface that can drive the UI is not a
thing to make reachable by editing one flag.

**Its own runner on a random ephemeral port.** Not a route on the dashboard app: the
dashboard's port is knowable, and a control surface on a knowable port is a port-scan
away from being probed. The port is chosen by the OS at boot (``port=0``) and published
only in a 0600 discovery file, so *finding* the bridge already requires read access to
the user's home directory.

**The discovery file carries a token REF, never the token.** ``token_ref`` names the
credential key; the agent sources the value from the environment or the credential
store the same way every other surface's client does. A file that carried the secret
would make "readable discovery file" and "authenticated" the same thing.

**`requiresConfirmation` is enforced HERE, not by client politeness.** A confirm-flagged
action never mutates on first call: it returns ``needs_confirmation`` plus an opaque
token and raises a needs-input notification, and only the USER (in the dashboard, or via
``gideon inbound confirm <token>``) turns that into an execution. A client that
ignores the flag gets a refusal, not a mutation.

**User content leaves through the ONE inbound wrapper.** ``read_transcript`` hands a
model the user's own conversation, which is the classic injection carrier: whatever was
pasted, fetched or forwarded into a chat comes back out as text an external agent reads.
So an action declares :attr:`Action.user_content` — the result key carrying that text —
and :func:`_run` routes it through :func:`gideon.integrations.inbound.framing.fence_payload`,
the same choke point every other inbound dialect returns through (§1.4). The fence is
applied in ``_run`` rather than in the handler on purpose: ``_run`` is the single place
an action result becomes a response, so a handler cannot forget, and a handler that
fenced its own field would be a second spelling of the fence.

``sideEffect: "destructive"`` deliberately has no members in v1 — delete and uninstall
are absent rather than confirm-gated, because the safest confirmation flow for a
destructive control action is not having one.

**The catalogue is filtered to the caller's pin, and the digest covers what was served.**
A self-describing surface that describes MORE than the caller may invoke is an
enumeration of the authority the caller lacks. `GET /actions` therefore resolves the
bearer to a client record (`_admit`), narrows the catalogue by that record's ``tools``
binding, and fingerprints the SERVED list — because a digest computed over the full
registry never matches a filtered payload, which turns the client's cache into a
per-request re-fetch. The same `_bound` predicate gates `/action` AND `/confirm`, so the
description and the enforcement cannot drift.
