"""Dialect 4 — the A2A gateway (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §5).

Three literal routes, all outside the dashboard's cookie-auth world, all behind the
shared inbound seam (`gate.admission_problem` → `auth.peer_allowed` → bearer → caps):

* ``GET  /a2a/agent-card``      — the agent card. Its *skills* are the workflow
  templates the user PUBLISHED (``metadata.a2a_published``).
* ``POST /a2a/tasks``           — start one task. Maps onto a ``WorkflowRun`` through
  ``workflows.service.start_run`` — the v2 run-start seam, not a parallel launcher.
* ``GET  /a2a/tasks/{task_id}`` — poll one task.

Four decisions here are load-bearing and each is placed where it is on purpose.

**Publication is OPT-IN, per template, and defaults to FALSE.** ``a2a_published`` is a
typed ``DefMetadata`` field defaulting to ``False``, so a template that has never heard
of A2A is not on the card. The inverse — publish-by-default with an opt-out — would mean
enabling this surface silently exposes every template the user ever authored, including
ones whose *inputs* are the interesting part. The default is asserted by a test with a
vacuity floor precisely because a default is the easiest thing in this file to flip by
accident.

**An EMPTY card and a BROKEN card must not look alike.** ``workflows.service.list_defs``
swallows a provider failure by design ("one broken provider must not hide every other
pack's templates"), so a total catalog failure returns ``{"defs": []}`` with ``ok:
True``. Served straight through, that renders as a well-formed card advertising no
skills — indistinguishable from "the user published nothing", which is a *correct*
answer this surface must be able to give. :func:`published_skills` therefore returns a
``problem`` string alongside the skills, and a problem answers **503**. A 200 card with
``skills: []`` is then a positive claim: the catalog was read and nobody opted in.

**A task id IS the run id.** No side table maps one to the other. The alternative —
minting an A2A id and remembering the pairing — puts the mapping in a process-local
cache that a restart drops, so ``GET /a2a/tasks/<id>`` would 404 on a run that plainly
exists. The A2A spec has the *server* assign ``Task.id``, so nothing is owed to the
client here. A client's ``messageId`` (or an explicit ``idempotencyKey``) becomes
``start_run``'s caller key instead, which is what makes a retried send return the same
task rather than starting a second run.

**Headless is inherited, not configured.** The run's session key is
``inbound:a2a:<client>``, and ``guardrails.policy.INBOUND_PREFIX`` already classifies
that family as unattended → ``HEADLESS``. There is deliberately no profile argument on
this path: a surface that *chooses* its own safety profile is a surface that can choose
wrong, and an A2A caller must inherit exactly the ceiling an inbound OpenAI client gets.
The request-side ceiling comes from ``caps.caps_for(client)`` — the same three-layer
resolution every other dialect uses.

Every returned artifact goes through ``framing.fence_payload``, which is the one wrapper
over ``security.fence_untrusted``. This module contains no second fencing helper.
