"""Diarization (core L1) — the "who spoke when" capability + provider registry.

Its own first-class use-case (parallel to ``stt``), served by a separate diarization
provider app (ONNX default + optional pyannote). Core owns the seam + registry + the
deterministic speaker-fusion node; the heavy models live in the app.
