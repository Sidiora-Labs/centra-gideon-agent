"""Abstract base for sync transport providers (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.3).

A sync transport carries durability shard objects between machines through one remote —
a git repo, a synced folder, later an object store. Every method is insert-only and
idempotent on the object key, because the sync cycle retries freely on a CAS race and a
retried push of an object already present must be a no-op, never a duplicate or an
overwrite (§4.1). A transport owns credentials and byte movement ONLY; the merge, the
machine-seq registry contents, and the outbox all live above it in
:mod:`gideon.operations.durability.sync`.
