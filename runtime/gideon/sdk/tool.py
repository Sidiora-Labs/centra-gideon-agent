"""SDK: the tool-provider ABC + data types + the shared output-projection discipline.

Stable re-export of ``gideon.tool_providers.base`` (the ABC + types) plus the
dispatch-time output projection (``project_and_retain`` + its default cap) every tool
surface shares — so a tool APP (e.g. the MCP adapter) projects + retains large results
identically to the native builtins, without reaching into core internals.
