"""SDK: the guarded network-egress chokepoint + the high-level web fetch/extract.

Stable re-export of ``gideon.net`` (the egress policy layer: ``fetch`` + the
``CONNECTOR`` policy — an app's outbound traffic is subject to the same guard core
uses) and ``gideon.web.fetch`` (the SSRF-guarded page fetch + content
extraction pipeline: ``web_fetch``/``web_extract`` + ``record_seen_urls`` provenance).
Generic, provider-agnostic infrastructure a web-capable app/tool builds on.

# EXTERNAL-ACCESS §5 (EA-8): the egress posture for an OUTBOUND A2A call, promoted here so
# the `a2a-action` app can USE the policy without composing one. That split is deliberate and
# is the whole reason this export exists: `outbound_policy` is `allow_only=True`
# (deny-by-default — an empty allow-list reaches NOWHERE), which an app free to build its own
# `EgressPolicy` could quietly relax to the additive `egress_policy_for(CONNECTOR)` shape that
# reaches every public host. The app supplies a URL; core decides where a URL may point.

# openai-tools' ``connected`` property, skills-sh's SkillsMarketplace ABC (_get) —
# can still guard an operator-configured endpoint before a raw request, WITHOUT
