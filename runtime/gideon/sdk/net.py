"""SDK: the guarded network-egress chokepoint + the high-level web fetch/extract.

Stable re-export of ``gideon.net`` (the egress policy layer: ``fetch`` + the
``CONNECTOR`` policy — an app's outbound traffic is subject to the same guard core
uses) and ``gideon.web.fetch`` (the SSRF-guarded page fetch + content
extraction pipeline: ``web_fetch``/``web_extract`` + ``record_seen_urls`` provenance).
Generic, provider-agnostic infrastructure a web-capable app/tool builds on.

# openai-tools' ``connected`` property, skills-sh's SkillsMarketplace ABC (_get) —
# can still guard an operator-configured endpoint before a raw request, WITHOUT
# reaching into ``gideon.net`` directly (the app import-boundary forbids that).
