"""SDK: the speech-to-text (STT) provider ABC + the shared helper an STT app needs.

Stable re-export of the ``SttProvider`` ABC + ``SttModel`` — an STT app implements
these and its factory returns a provider that core's stt registry resolves the ``stt``
use-case to. ``ensure_ffmpeg_in_path`` is the one cross-cutting helper a local STT
backend needs (audio decoding), exposed here so the app doesn't reach into core
internals.
