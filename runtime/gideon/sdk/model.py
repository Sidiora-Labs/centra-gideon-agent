"""SDK: the model (LLM) provider ABC + the generic LLM infrastructure a model app
builds on.

Stable re-exports of the provider-agnostic LLM machinery — the ``ModelProvider`` ABC
+ event/stream types, the capability descriptors, the provider registry (so an app
registers its type + capability factory), the credential type, the streaming-tag
splitter, the context-window lookup, and ``OpenAIProvider`` (the canonical OpenAI-wire
client that any OpenAI-COMPATIBLE endpoint app — vllm, together, groq, … — subclasses).

An app imports these, not core internals, so core can evolve underneath it. This is
generic infra: openai/anthropic/bedrock/vllm are all implementations built on it (they
ship pre-installed for a working out-of-box system, but are architecturally identical
to any installed model app). Ollama is the one model provider that stays core-native
(it owns model download/management), so it is not built on this surface.

# The two supported inference-PROTOCOL clients — the standards Gideon speaks,
# not provider-specific. A model-provider app declares which protocol it speaks +
# how it authenticates/configures: an OpenAI-compatible endpoint app (openai, vllm,
# lmstudio, together, …) builds on OpenAIProvider; an Anthropic-compatible one builds
# on AnthropicProvider. (A provider with a distinct wire, e.g. Bedrock's Converse API,

# ``CACHE_HINT_KEY`` rides alongside ``PromptCache`` because an app whose provider owns

# core never learns that vendor's cache syntax. Core's own tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py
# names this the prescribed fix: "If a symbol isn't on the SDK yet, the fix is to PROMOTE it

# ``register_branded_app`` is the one name here that a SIBLING SDK module owns rather than
# core. Re-exported so an app uses the single stable ``gideon.sdk.model`` path. This is
# a plain top-of-file import and MUST stay one: ``sdk.provider_helpers`` imports its core
# machinery straight from ``gideon.llm.*``, so the edge runs one way only. Reversing
# that (importing ``sdk.model`` from ``provider_helpers``) reinstates a module-scope cycle in
# which whichever module is imported first from a cold interpreter decides whether the SDK
# loads at all. tests/test_sdk_import_cycle.py drives both orders and fails if it comes back.
