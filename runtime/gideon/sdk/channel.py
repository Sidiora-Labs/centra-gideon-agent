"""SDK: the channel-transport contract + the runtime surface a channel app needs.

A channel app (Slack, and future Telegram/Discord) owns a full inbound receiver +
outbound renderer, so it needs more of the platform than a leaf provider: session
routing, conversation history, cron/schedule, context building, transcription,
security redaction, audit (SEL), and the gateway-services / channel-delivery
contracts. Rather than let the app reach into core internals (which would freeze
those internals), every symbol it needs is re-exported here — the single stable
channel SDK facade. Core can move the underlying modules without breaking apps.

Grouped by concern below. All names are re-exports; see the owning core module for
the authoritative docs.

# ── Dashboard integration (link/handoff/mirror/update surfaces a channel drives) ──
# `save_session_to_history` was `_save_session_to_history` — an underscore-named core
# internal on a published surface, which is a contradiction the docstring above cannot
# hold: an app CANNOT be insulated from a name whose spelling says "may move without
# notice". One bundled channel app drives it, so it was a public contract by use; it is
# now public by name, at its definition site.
#
# `run_chat` is OFF this facade (EA-7 step 3). It was a SECOND route past the
# sender-trust gate — the exact defect :mod:`gideon.channel_inbound` exists to
# close — and the chokepoint is only a chokepoint now that the door is the only route:
# an app starts a channel-originated turn through `services.deliver_channel_inbound`,
# never by driving the turn itself. `run_chat` could not carry the guard (it has no
# sender to check; it legitimately serves the owner's own dashboard turns, cron,
# heartbeat and the CLI, where there is no channel identity and nothing to deny), so
# removal was the fix. The export could only go once all four bundled channel apps had
# migrated onto the door and stopped importing it — discord/email/telegram transports
# and slack's handler, landed as GideonApps #72 and #73 — because the apps repo
# is a separate release artifact that cannot land atomically with core.
# `tests/test_channel_inbound_chokepoint.py` now asserts the ABSENCE, so the second
# route cannot quietly return, and the `gideon.sdk.*`-only import boundary
# (`tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py`) makes the door structural rather than
