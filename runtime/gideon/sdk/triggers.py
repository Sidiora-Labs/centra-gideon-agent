"""SDK: the trigger-store contract — ``TriggerStoreProvider`` + the row/entity types.

A trigger-store app imports these from ``gideon.sdk.triggers`` (never from the core modules
directly) to contribute a STORE of trigger ROWS — a shared or team automation backend. It implements
:class:`TriggerStoreProvider` (list/get/upsert/delete + ``changed_on_disk`` change-notify), returns
:class:`LoadedTrigger` rows built from :class:`Trigger` entities, and registers through the
``trigger`` provider type (``providers/registry.py::TriggerTypeHandler``).

**This is not ``gideon.sdk.trigger_source``.** That contract contributes the STIMULUS — a live
observer that pushes events onto the bus. This one contributes the RULE — a passive store of trigger
definitions. If you are writing something with ``start``/``stop`` that notices things happening, you
want ``trigger_source``; if you are writing something that answers "which automations exist", you
want this.

**Rows, never execution.** Core does all firing, under all of its own gates. Two consequences worth
building against:

* Stamp ``Trigger.author`` with the username of whoever created each row. Core arms and fires ONLY
  rows whose author matches the local owner; everyone else's render read-only on the Automations
  page. An unattributed row (``author=""``) reads as the local owner's, so a multi-user store that
  omits the field will have every machine arming every row — attribute your rows.
* A read that raises is logged and skipped for that pass, so an outage in your backend costs your
  rows and never stops the owner's local automations. Prefer serving a cached answer to raising, and
  answer ``changed_on_disk()`` honestly so core knows when to re-read.
* **``upsert`` must really persist ``next_fire_at``, and ``get`` must show it.** When core fires one
  of your rows it writes the row's next schedule back to YOUR store — that is what makes an
  app-served trigger fire once rather than every tick — and it then re-reads the row to check the
  timestamp moved. A store that accepts the write and keeps the old value, or that cannot read the
  row back, is **quarantined**: its rows stop being armed for the rest of the process (they still
  render) and a warning is logged. So a deliberately read-only store is honest and safe — it simply
  never arms — but a store that pretends to write is the one shape that costs the owner a fire.
  ``run_count``, ``last_fired_at``, ``state`` and the health fields arrive through the same write;
  round-trip them too, or the owner's budget, spacing and autopause gates read a permanent zero.
* A row whose id also exists in the owner's local ``triggers.json`` is **not armed** — the local row
  wins, because one identity cannot hold two schedules. Both stay visible on the Automations page so
  the collision is reportable. Namespace your ids.
