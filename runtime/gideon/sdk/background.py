"""SDK: the supervised background-worker ABC + its cooperative control protocol.

Stable re-export of ``gideon.apps.background`` — an app imports these, not the core
module directly, so the core path can move without breaking installed apps. Gated by the
app's ``backgroundTasks`` permission, verified host-side before the worker is spawned.
