"""SDK: an app's persisted per-provider settings.

Stable re-export of ``gideon.extensions.providers.settings.ProviderSettings`` — the
generic, provider-agnostic accessor an app uses to load/save/update its own
configuration (the settingsSchema in its app.json). An app imports this, not the
core module, so the core path can move without breaking installed apps.
