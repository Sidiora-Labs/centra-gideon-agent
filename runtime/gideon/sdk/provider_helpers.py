"""SDK helpers for building a model-provider APP with minimal boilerplate.

A model provider that speaks one of the two supported inference PROTOCOLS
(OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible) over a fixed endpoint + bearer key —
i.e. every branded provider app (Together, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, Gemini's
OpenAI shim, …) and the two generic "bring-your-own-endpoint" apps — differs from
its siblings ONLY in: its default base URL, its API-key env var, and its fallback
model catalog. Everything else (the registry ``_factory``, the ``create_provider``
config-path factory, credential resolution, and the ``ModelCatalog``) is identical.

These helpers capture that identical wiring so each app's ``provider.py`` is a few
declarations + one ``register_*_app(...)`` call. The helpers build on the SDK
primitives (``OpenAIProvider`` / ``AnthropicProvider`` / ``ModelCatalog`` /
``openai_compatible_list_models``) — this is generic protocol infra, NOT one app
importing another.

An app that needs provider-specific behavior beyond endpoint+key+catalog (e.g.
Azure OpenAI's distinct ``AsyncAzureOpenAI`` client + ``api_version`` + api-key
header) does NOT use these — it subclasses the protocol client directly.

# ``register_branded_app``, so importing it back from here is a module-scope CYCLE: it made
# ``import gideon.sdk.provider_helpers`` from a cold interpreter fail outright, and
# only ``import gideon.sdk.model`` first happened to work. The two SDK modules are
# both thin re-export surfaces over the same core layer, so there is nothing to gain by
# routing one through the other — one direction only (``sdk.model`` → here), pinned by
# tests/test_sdk_import_cycle.py.
#
# The spec dataclass, the registry it lands in, and the credential ladder live in
# ``gideon.llm.branded_specs`` — below this boundary, because they are core state and
# core policy that four core modules read. They are re-exported here so an app's import path
# is unchanged; only the direction of the dependency moved. See that module's docstring.
