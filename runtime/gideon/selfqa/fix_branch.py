"""Optional fix-branch stage — SV-10 §3.2 step 6, Success Criterion #8.

On a confirmed finding, and only when ``agent.self_qa.fix_branch_enabled`` is on, the companion
opens a branch named ``gideon/selfqa-<sha8>`` off the commit under test. A coder can then propose a
diff on it; the human reviews and decides. Two properties are the whole point and are enforced
here rather than trusted to a prompt:

**It is created only when enabled.** The flag is a decision about writing code unattended, so a
disabled companion creates nothing — :func:`create_fix_branch` returns a result whose ``branch``
name is still computed (so a caller can show what *would* be created) but ``created`` is False.

**It is never merged and never pushed.** This module runs ``git branch`` and read-only
``rev-parse`` and nothing else — there is no push verb anywhere in it, so "we forgot and pushed"
is not a failure mode a reviewer has to check for. The branch name lands in the Task
(:class:`gideon.selfqa.findings.ScenarioFinding.fix_branch`); a human pushes or merges it, or
does neither.

The branch name follows the plan's ``<sha8>`` convention, not the full sha, so it is short enough
to read in a Task title and matches the branch a reviewer greps for. The git runner mirrors
:mod:`gideon.loop.worktree`'s discipline — a fixed argv, no shell, a hex-validated ref, a
time bound, and the ``build`` resource ceiling delivered via ``spawn_shim_argv`` — because this is
write-capable git driven by an unattended run, exactly the class that machinery bounds.
