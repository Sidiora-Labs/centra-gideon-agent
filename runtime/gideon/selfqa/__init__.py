"""Self-QA Companion core (SELF-VERIFICATION §3) — the commit→triage→scenario→findings loop.

The composed loop is **commit → triage → as-a-user execution → evidence → findings**, and
every primitive it needs already exists: the zero-token cron seam
(:mod:`gideon.schedule_script`), the bundled template pack
(:mod:`gideon.workflows.bundled_defs`), the run ledger
(:mod:`gideon.ledger`), the native inbox push sink
(:func:`gideon.inbox_providers.native_source.post_to_inbox`) and the native task
provider (:mod:`gideon.tasks.registry`). This package is the composition plus the two
genuinely new pieces: **triage** (which commits are worth a scenario) and **filing** (what a
failure leaves behind).

Three deliberate shapes:

**Triage is deterministic, not inferred.** A commit's user-impact is decided from its changed
paths (:mod:`gideon.selfqa.triage`), not from a model call. The plan sketched an `infer`
node; a path classifier is cheaper, is the same answer every time, and — the reason that
matters here — is *assertable*. A prompt-only triage makes "a test-only commit skipped for the
right reason" indistinguishable from "the companion never fired", which is the exact failure
this loop exists to catch. The template still carries the deep-as-a-user *scenario* prompt,
where judgment genuinely is needed.

**A skip writes a row.** `impact=test` and `impact=none` do not silently drop the commit: they
write one ledger record carrying the one-line rationale
(:func:`gideon.selfqa.ledger.record_triage`). Silence and a correct skip must not look
alike from the run inbox.

**Filing is exactly one of each.** A failing scenario files one Inbox item and one Task
(:func:`gideon.selfqa.findings.file_finding`) — one is both floor and ceiling, and the
function enforces both ends rather than trusting its caller to call it once.

Nothing here writes to `memory.db` or `knowledge.db`: commit-watch state is a file under the
cron-scripts dir, findings are Inbox/Task entities, evidence is an Artifact.
