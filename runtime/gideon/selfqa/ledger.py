"""The ledger side of triage — a skip that leaves a row behind.

"A test-only commit yields a ledger-only skip with a one-line rationale" is an assertion about
what gets *written*, not about what is absent. A companion that ran and correctly skipped, and
a companion that never fired at all, both produce zero Inbox items and zero Tasks; the only
thing that separates them is this record. So the skip path writes first and returns second, and
:func:`record_triage` refuses to write a record with no rationale rather than emitting a row
that answers "why did nothing run?" with an empty string.

The record goes through the platform ledger primitive (:mod:`gideon.ledger`, PP-4) using
existing kinds — `step_skipped` for a skip, `decision` for an impactful commit that proceeds. No
new ledger kind is minted for this: a consumer that already folds `step_skipped` gets the
companion's skips for free, and one that does not would not learn a bespoke kind either.
