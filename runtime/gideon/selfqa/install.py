"""Materializing the commit-watch script into ``~/.gideon/crons/``.

The script cannot be served from the package the way bundled templates are.
:func:`gideon.schedule_script.resolve_script_path` requires a script job's file to resolve
*under* the crons dir — that path fence is the whole reason a script job is safe to schedule — so
the file has to physically exist there.

That makes this an install step, and install steps into the user's home need a story for "did the
user edit it?" on upgrade. The answer here: the shipped copy is overwritten when its content
differs, and the state file beside it is never touched. This script is companion machinery rather
than a user template — the user's knobs are in `agent.self_qa`, not in this file — so silently
preserving a local edit would strand a fixed watcher on a broken version. A user who wants
different watch behaviour writes their own script under `crons/` and points a job at that.
