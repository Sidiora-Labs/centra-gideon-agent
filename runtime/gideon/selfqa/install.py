"""Converging the Self-QA commit watch onto the vcs trigger (SELF-VERIFICATION SV-11).

The Wave-2 companion shipped an interim seam — a cron script materialized into
``~/.gideon/crons/`` on an interval trigger — because no vcs trigger existed yet and a
script job may only load from that fenced directory. AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's ``vcs`` preset
now exists (:func:`gideon.triggers.file_watch.vcs_patterns`), so this module does what
the plan's §3.1 promised from the start: *"When AUTO-R12's vcs preset lands, the cron script
retires and the same template binds to the real trigger — the template is the durable half,
the trigger is a swap."*

:func:`reconcile` therefore converges a ``file``-kind trigger (the vcs preset over
``agent.self_qa.watched_repo``) whose action is the ``selfqa-commit-watch`` provider — the
retired script's delta logic, moved in-process (:mod:`gideon.selfqa.watch`). It also
REMOVES any interim artifacts a Wave-2 home still carries (the installed script, its config,
its state file beside them): pre-1.0 clean break, per CONTRIBUTING's breaking-changes
posture, and leaving a dead script in the crons dir would invite a user to schedule it.
