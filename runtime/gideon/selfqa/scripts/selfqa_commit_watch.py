"""Self-QA commit watcher — a zero-token cron script (SELF-VERIFICATION §3.1).

Installed to ``~/.gideon/crons/selfqa_commit_watch.py`` and run by an interval trigger
through the ``run-script`` action. Each tick it reads the watched repo's HEAD, compares it
against the last SHA it recorded, and either raises ``Skip`` (nothing new — silent, zero cost) or
starts the `self-qa` run itself via ``ctx.call_tool("workflow_start", …)`` and raises ``Report``
naming what it started.

**The script starts the run; the trigger's action does not.** The plan sketched a `run-workflow`
action consuming the watcher's report, which would need the reported SHA list to flow from a
script's `Report` into a second action's inputs — a hand-off that does not exist. `call_tool`
does: it routes through the Tool entity, so one `run-script` job is the whole trigger and the
`Report` is a record of what happened rather than an instruction to something downstream. See
:func:`check`.

**This is an interim seam, stated honestly.** There is no `vcs` trigger kind today; the approved
one (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE AUTO-R12: a `file` trigger watching `.git/refs/heads/*` with
content-hash dedup) is a later wave. When it lands, this script retires and the same template
binds to the real trigger. The template is the durable half; the trigger is a swap.

Two constraints shape the imports below, and both are load-bearing:

- **Only ``gideon.schedule_script`` may be imported.** The in-sandbox launcher installs a
  *stub* ``gideon`` module into ``sys.modules`` when the real package is not on the child's
  path. A ``from gideon.config.loader import config_dir`` would therefore fail inside the
  sandbox even though it works in a test. The state path is derived from ``__file__`` instead —
  which is the crons dir by definition, since that is the only directory a script job may load
  from.
- **Everything else is stdlib.** The child environment is allowlisted and there is no guarantee
  of anything else being importable.

#: 🪤 THIS FILE IS THE ONLY WORKING CHANNEL, and the two obvious alternatives both fail silently.
#: An env var is dropped: `sandbox.build_child_env` builds the child environment from an allowlist
#: rather than from a copy of the parent's, so a bespoke `GIDEON_SELFQA_*` name never arrives
#: unless the operator adds it to `sandbox.env_passthrough`. The job message is empty: a trigger
#: fire constructs `ActionContext(event=…, context="", …)`, so `run-script` hands the launcher
#: `job_message=""` and `ctx.message` is blank however the job was created. Measured against
#: `gateway.py`'s fire path, not assumed.
#:
#: A file beside the script is also the only source the sandbox can read at all: the launcher
#: installs a STUB `gideon` package into `sys.modules` when the real one is not on the
#: child's path, so `from gideon.config.loader import config_dir` would fail here. The path
#: is derived from `__file__`, which is the crons dir by definition.
