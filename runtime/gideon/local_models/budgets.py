"""Per-model context-budget derivation from the local-model catalog (LMMV §2.2).

A local model's real context window is a **catalog fact**, not a provider constant. A
4k-context GGUF and a 200k-context hosted model are the same object to every caller that
asks "how much room do I have?", and until this module existed the answer came from a
hardcoded table of *hosted* model ids (:mod:`gideon.model_windows`, whose
absent-model fallback is 200k) plus each adapter's own hardcoded output cap. For a local
model neither number is a fact: the model is not in the hosted table, so it inherited a
200k window it does not have, and it inherited a 4096-token output cap nobody declared.

This module derives the number instead. :class:`LocalModel` already carries
``context_tokens`` / ``output_tokens`` off the model card (LMMV §2.1), so the catalog is
the authority when it speaks and the existing shared window table remains the fallback
when it does not. ``0`` is a legitimate, expected card value meaning **"unknown"** — it
is never treated as a window of zero and is never divided by.

Scope, deliberately: this makes the *number* available and nothing more. It does not
decide what to drop when a prompt exceeds the budget — that is compaction's job
(:mod:`gideon.workflows.compaction`) and it is untouched here.

#: The output cap used when NEITHER the catalog nor the window table declares one. This
#: is the same number the provider adapters hardcoded before this module existed
#: (``llm/anthropic.py``'s ``max_tokens: int = 4096``, and the anthropic model app's
#: ``options.pop("max_tokens", 4096)``), kept here as the single named floor of last
#: resort rather than as the value every model silently receives.
DEFAULT_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 4096

#: A declared (or defaulted) output cap never eats more than this fraction of the
#: window: a 4k-context model with a 4096-token output cap would leave literally no room
#: for the prompt, which is worse than a smaller answer.
MAX_OUTPUT_FRACTION = 0.5

#: Floor for every derived number. A budget is a positive count of tokens or it is a
#: bug: a zero would make a caller's ``prompt // budget`` divide by zero and a negative
#: would read as "unbounded" at exactly the call that needs a bound most.
