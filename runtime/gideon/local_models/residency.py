"""What is occupying this machine's RAM right now (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 §7).

Models outlive the bindings that loaded them, and a sidecar adds a whole child process
to the picture, so "why is 6 GB gone?" had no answer anywhere in the product. This module
is that answer: every resident occupant, with attribution, plus a system memory-pressure
snapshot and the unload lever.

Two facts make the surface honest rather than decorative:

* **``is_active`` is attribution, not liveness.** A model stays loaded after the user
  binds a different one; that row is resident AND inactive, which is exactly the case
  worth showing, because it is the reclaimable one.
* **A sidecar's RSS is CHILD-REPORTED.** The gateway cannot see inside another process's
  heap, so the number comes from the child's own ``stat`` frame (§3.1). An in-process
  model has no separately attributable RSS at all — the honest value is ``None``, never a
  fabricated split of the gateway's own footprint.
