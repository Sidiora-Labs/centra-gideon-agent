"""On-disk layout probing for downloaded local models (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 §4.4).

**The bug class this exists to end.** A downloaded model can land on disk in several shapes
depending on who fetched it, and every consumer was guessing at one of them:

* **HF hub snapshot** — `models--{org}--{name}/snapshots/{rev}/…`, with the real bytes in
  `blobs/` and symlinks in the snapshot dir. This is what `huggingface_hub` produces, and the
  one most often guessed wrong because the model id (`org/name`) does not appear literally.
* **Provider-native** — a directory or file named after the model, which a provider's own
  `save()` wrote.
* **Direct file** — a single artifact (`.onnx`, `.gguf`, a piper voice) fetched by URL, where
  the model id maps to a filename possibly with an extension.

Guessing one layout gives a `downloaded` flag that reads False for a model sitting right
there — the user re-downloads gigabytes — or a `delete` that reports success while leaving the
weights behind, so the disk never frees. Both were observed, which is why the plan makes this
ONE shared helper that probes **every** layout rather than per-provider guesses.

**A partial download is NOT downloaded.** `models--…/blobs` holding only `*.incomplete`, or a
bare `<name>.part`, means an interrupted fetch. Reporting that as present is worse than
reporting nothing: the user gets a model that fails at load time with no explanation.

**Deleting is greedy on purpose.** `delete_all_layouts` removes every layout it finds and
returns what it touched, rather than stopping at the first hit. A model that was fetched twice
by different paths (a provider `save()` and later an HF snapshot) leaves two copies, and a
delete that frees one of them is the disk-never-frees bug in a different costume.
