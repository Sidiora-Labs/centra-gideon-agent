"""Project service — the first-class work-unit container.

A **Project** (the Tasks ``hierarchy.Project``, see :mod:`gideon.tasks.models`)
ties together everything a user does on one logical effort: Goal Loops, Code
projects, and manually-created Tasks all scope under one project, sharing its
context directory for continuation.

This module is the small service layer the work-unit features call to RESOLVE a
project to bind to. It deliberately holds no state of its own — it composes the
``HierarchyStore`` — so both Goal Loop and Code share one binding policy:

- ``resolve_project_id`` — given an optional chosen id, return a usable project id,
  auto-creating a fresh one when nothing is chosen (the "initiate a project for the
  session" behavior).
- ``ensure_task_list`` — find-or-create the per-work-unit TaskList UNDER its bound
  project (replacing the old umbrella "Goal Loops"/"Code" projects), so a unit's
  decomposed tasks live in the project the user chose.
