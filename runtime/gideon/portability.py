"""Portable zip export/import for Gideon state — the DSAR surface (§6).

Creates a zip archive of Gideon state for download via the dashboard, and
restores from uploaded zip archives. Designed to work over HTTP for remote users
(e.g. remote Linux server → local browser).

Two properties this module exists to guarantee, both now enforced by construction
rather than by a hand-maintained list:

* **`secret ∪ derived` never leaves the machine.** Every write site runs through
  :func:`_is_excluded`, which projects the inventory's ``secret=True`` *and*
  ``derived=True`` entries. Measured before this was true: the export's hardcoded
  database list carried ``memory_index.db`` — declared ``derived=True`` — so a
  "portable export" shipped a stale vector index that a restore would then pair
  with a newer store, the exact hazard `inventory.export_entries()` documents.
* **An export declares its own scope.** A per-domain export (memory / knowledge /
  work / automation / platform / config) carries only that domain's declared
  entries, and prunes every *other* domain's entries out of the tree walks — so a
  ``platform`` export cannot smuggle ``workspace/knowledge/files`` (the user's
  documents) out under cover of the ``workspace`` tree.

MANIFEST versions (:data:`SUPPORTED_MANIFEST_VERSIONS`): v1/v2 carry sizes only;
**v3 carries per-member ``bytes`` + ``sha256`` plus ``schema_version``/``machine_id``
(§2's integrity shape)**, so :func:`validate_import_zip` can detect a corrupted
archive before an import writes anything. v1/v2 zips still import — there is simply
nothing to verify them against, which is stated rather than silently assumed.

    ``derived``, and the export's hardcoded database list named ``memory_index.db``

            🔴 WHY (DAS-10). Two write sites could emit the same declared database: the
            projection below (safe, WAL-checkpointed) and the `workspace` tree walk
            (a raw `zf.write`). Measured on a home whose `workspace/lexicon/lexicon.db`
            had a 53 KB uncheckpointed WAL: the zip carried the path TWICE (6 entries
            against 5 declared members, plus a `Duplicate name` warning), shipped
            `lexicon.db-wal` **and** `lexicon.db-shm`, and — worst — when
            `_backup_sqlite` raised and the projection logged "skipping unreadable
            database", the tree walk shipped a raw 45 KB copy anyway *and the manifest
            declared it*. That inverts the projection's fail-closed intent: a store the
            export decided not to carry travelled regardless, as a validated member.

            The inventory sweep further down already refuses raw database copies for
            exactly this reason. It skips **every** `.db` in a tree; this predicate is
            deliberately narrower — only the databases the projection owns — because
            `workspace/` is the user's own directory and silently dropping an *undeclared*
            sqlite file a user put there would trade one data defect for another.

    * ``replace`` moves each live path into ``pre-restore-<ts>/`` **before** writing the
      incoming one (`snapshot._do_replace`), so a failure part-way leaves the displaced
      originals on disk under that directory and the summary reports its path. That
      directory is the recovery: it is removed only when it ends up empty, i.e. only
      when nothing was displaced. A replace that dies mid-way is therefore recoverable
