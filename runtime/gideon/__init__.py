    """Process-wide shutdown signal that rebinds to the running event loop.

    A plain module-level ``asyncio.Event()`` binds to whichever loop first
    touches it; awaiting it later from a different loop (e.g. the fresh loop
    ``asyncio.run()`` creates for the gateway, or a loop after an in-process
    restart) raises ``RuntimeError: got Future attached to a different loop``
    and crashes the gateway in a restart spiral.

    This proxy lazily (re)creates the underlying :class:`asyncio.Event` on the
    *current* running loop, so each ``asyncio.run()`` gets a fresh, correctly
    bound Event. A ``set()`` issued with no loop running is remembered and
    applied to the next Event built. Background loops use
    ``await shutdown_event.wait()`` (with a timeout) instead of plain
    ``asyncio.sleep()`` so they wake instantly on Ctrl-C.
