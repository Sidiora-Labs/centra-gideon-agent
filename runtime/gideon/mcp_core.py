"""Gideon core agent tools + the ``mcp-core`` MCP-server composition root.

Two roles:

* **Residual core tools** — the cross-cutting tools that don't belong to a single
  entity category, owned here and served in-process via the bundled
  ``gideon-core`` tool provider:
      skill_invoke       — load a skill's full instructions on demand
      wait               — pause the loop for an external system
      hook_register      — register a webhook-listener session
      notify             — reach the user via their notification channel
      notify_attachment  — notify with a file attachment
      loop_nudge_stop    — halt the autonomous self-nudge loop
  (The entity-specific tool groups live in their own modules + providers —
  ``mcp_subagents`` / ``mcp_memory`` / ``mcp_artifacts`` / ``mcp_prompts``.)

* **MCP-server composition root** — ``run_mcp_core_server`` runs as
  ``gideon mcp-core``, the single stdio MCP server an ACP CLI (claude-code/
  codex) spawns. It aggregates this module's tools with every category module's
  (``_AGGREGATED_CATEGORY_MODULES``) so that one server exposes the FULL tool set,
  while the native loop calls each provider's handlers in-process.

The shared session/HTTP plumbing (``_resolve_session_key`` / ``_get`` / ``_post`` /
``_delete`` / ``_CURRENT_AGENT_ID``) is owned here and imported by the category
modules. Tool names are entity-prefixed and PClaw-native.
