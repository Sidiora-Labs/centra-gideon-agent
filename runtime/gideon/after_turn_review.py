"""After-turn self-improvement review — continuous, per-turn learning.

Gideon learns at consolidation time (session-end, batched). This adds a
**continuous** layer: after a learning-worthy turn, a bounded background review
captures durable memory — so a correction at turn 3 is learned before turn 4,
not reconstructed at session end. Absorbs the memory half of the old
"auto-capture corrections" port (the correction heuristic lives here).

Two hard guardrails (the difference between learning and self-sabotage):
- **Never learn environment-dependent failures** — "tool X is broken", "not
  allowed here", "command failed" harden into refusals the agent later cites
  against itself. A deny-filter blocks these from becoming durable memory.
- **Skip sensitive / incognito / temporary sessions.**

**Eligibility is not decided here.** ``LearningGate``
(:mod:`gideon.learning.gate`) computes it once per event and every cadence
consumes that one decision — this module used to own a ``should_review`` that
callers recomputed independently, which is how two capture paths in the same turn
came to disagree. What stays here is what is genuinely this module's own: the
correction heuristic, the environment-failure deny-filter, and the capture itself.

Writes flow through ``write_lesson`` (→ the contradiction judge from #18), so a
captured correction is deduped + contradiction-checked like any other lesson.

The heuristic + guardrail are pure, testable functions; the actual capture
(``run_after_turn_review``) is best-effort and never blocks the turn.

    Split out from :func:`run_skill_ladder_review` so every exit names its verdict: the

    pass unobservable. ``verdict`` is a key of :data:`_LADDER_VERDICT_LEVEL`; ``summary`` is
    the chip text (or None), unchanged.

    The fifth tier is the ad-hoc→template branch: it routes a procedure-shaped turn through
    ``learning.template_gate`` instead of the skill queue, because a repeatable plan and a how-to
    are different artifacts and the gate that judges plans is deterministic.

    ``completion`` is an injectable ``async (prompt)->str`` (defaults to
    ``one_shot_completion``) so tests drive it without a real model. Best-effort;
