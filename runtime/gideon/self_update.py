"""Self-update: what kind of install is this, and what does updating it mean.

Every surface that can update Gideon in place — the dashboard's
``POST /api/update``, the ``gideon update`` CLI, and the gateway's
unattended auto-update — has to answer the same two questions first: *how was
this copy installed?* and *what is the correct way to advance it?* This module
owns both answers, and the primitives that carry them out.

It lives in the core package, not under ``dashboard/``, deliberately. The
install-kind taxonomy shipped as ``dashboard/handlers/updates_kind.py``, which
made it reachable only by importing an HTTP handler — so the CLI kept its own
git-only pipeline and, on the pip/pipx/uv-tool installs the README documents
first, ``gideon update`` dead-ended on "GIDEON_PROJECT_DIR not set"
with the correct machinery one module away (DIST-13). A decision layer that only
one frontend can import will drift from the other one; this module is the seam
both call.

**Resolution order** (first hit wins, contract C1)::

    env GIDEON_INSTALL_KIND in {"container","desktop"}  -> that
        (baked into the Dockerfiles; set by the Electron shell, plan 45)
    a resolvable project dir that contains a .git directory     -> "git"
    else                                                        -> "pip"

``"pip"`` is one member covering every wheel install — ``pip``, ``pipx``,
``uv tool`` — because the apply is identical for all three: upgrade the wheel in
the running interpreter's environment. Which program performs it is resolved
separately by :mod:`gideon._installer` (a uv venv ships no pip).

**What this module does NOT own.** Sequencing and reporting stay with each
frontend, because the two lifecycles genuinely differ: the dashboard applies
asynchronously, publishes ``update_progress`` over the websocket, holds a 409
in-flight guard and re-execs the live gateway; the CLI applies synchronously,
prints to stdout, prompts a TTY and re-execs nothing (there is no server in that
process). A single ``apply(kind, progress=...)`` would be a callback-shaped
abstraction over two different lifecycles, so it was rejected — the shared part
is the decision plus these primitives.

Pre-1.0 clean break (owner 2026-07-20): implemented directly, WITHOUT a
lifecycle gate — there is no lifecycle/gates.py machinery yet, so this is the one
behavior, not a gated alternative to the old git-only path.

       (git writes it at clone time) — the answer when HEAD is detached, e.g. a
       checkout parked on a release tag. Offline-safe.
    3. **``git remote show origin``**, which asks the remote. Only reached when
       the local ref is absent (older clone, or a manually added remote), and it
       needs the network, so it is last among the probes.
    4. :data:`DEFAULT_BRANCH_FALLBACK` — the repository's real default branch.

    A literal fallback is only defensible if it names a branch that exists. Before
    DIST-13 this was hardcoded to a branch name this repository has never carried,
    so a detached-HEAD update fetched an unresolvable ref and failed confusingly.
