"""Check-work — claim reconstruction → derived executable checks → evidence report.

HARNESS-CRAFT §3.1/§3.2 (HC-4). ONE module, two entry points, so the skill and the
unattended hook can never grow two behaviors for one name:

* the bundled ``check-work`` skill (``skills/bundled/check-work/SKILL.md``) — the
  LIGHT, in-session half. The agent reconstructs what it claimed this session,
  calls :func:`derive_checks`, and executes what came back with real tool calls.
* the SDLC post-gate hook (``loops.check_work_stages``, default off) — the
  unattended half. After a stage's gate passes it re-derives checks from the
  stage's own claims, catching the "gate command passed but the claim is broader
  than the command" class (a claimed file that was never written).

**Doctrine — ground truth over self-report** (inherited from the loop
judge-independence work): a derived check either EXECUTES and yields ``pass`` or
``fail`` with quoted evidence, or it is reported ``unverifiable`` with the reason
it could not run. There is no third path. Nothing in this module returns ``pass``
without having observed something, and a claim that yields no derivable check is
reported as underivable rather than quietly dropped.

Command checks are never executed by this module on its own authority: the caller
injects a ``command_runner``. Without one, a command check is ``unverifiable``
("re-run it yourself"), which is the honest answer — not a pass.
