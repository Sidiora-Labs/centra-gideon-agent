"""Filing a failing scenario — exactly one Inbox item and exactly one Task.

The SV-9 atom's `done_when` reads "a failing scenario files one Inbox item + one Task", and *one*
is a ceiling as much as a floor. Three Inbox items for one failure trains the user to ignore the
inbox, which costs more than filing nothing. So the count is enforced here rather than left to
the caller's discipline: :func:`file_finding` files one of each per finding and is idempotent on
the finding's key, so a retried node, a resumed run, or a node that fires twice cannot multiply
the filing.

(The atom cites this to plan Success Criterion #6; #6 itself covers the watcher, the skip record
and the UI drive, and does not mention filing. The requirement is the atom's, not #6's — the
citation is the atom's, and it is recorded here rather than silently propagated.)

Both sinks are the existing native ones — `post_to_inbox` (the in-core push sink) and the native
`TaskProvider` through `tasks.registry.create_task`. No new inbox source, no new task provider;
§5 of the plan is explicit that inventing one is the tempting wrong answer here.

The two records are deliberately different documents. The Inbox item is the *interrupt*: one
line saying what broke, plus the evidence bundle reference. The Task is the *work*: the scenario
text, the reproduction steps, and the branch name if a fix branch was opened. A user who reads
only the inbox learns that something is wrong; a user who opens the task can act on it.
