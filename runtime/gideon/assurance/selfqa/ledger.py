"""The ledger side of triage — a skip that leaves a row behind.

"A test-only commit yields a ledger-only skip with a one-line rationale" is an assertion about
what gets *written*, not about what is absent. A companion that ran and correctly skipped, and
a companion that never fired at all, both produce zero Inbox items and zero Tasks; the only
thing that separates them is this record. So the skip path writes first and returns second, and
:func:`record_triage` refuses to write a record with no rationale rather than emitting a row
that answers "why did nothing run?" with an empty string.

The record goes through the platform ledger primitive (:mod:`gideon.assurance.ledger`, PP-4) using
existing kinds — `step_skipped` for a skip, `decision` for an impactful commit that proceeds. No
new ledger kind is minted for this: a consumer that already folds `step_skipped` gets the
companion's skips for free, and one that does not would not learn a bespoke kind either.

    A skipped commit writes `step_skipped`; an impactful one writes `decision` (it is a decision
    to spend a scenario, and the run's later step events cover the work itself). Both carry
    `sha`, `impact` and `rationale`, so the run inbox can render *why* without a second lookup.

    `instance_path` is the ENGINE's key for the node instance that is recording (`root.children[0]`,
    not the node id `triage`), supplied by the action payload the engine fills in. It is required
    for the same reason the rationale is: `service.inspect_node` builds a node's ledger slice by
    filtering the run's ledger on `instance_path == <the engine's instance key>`, so a row stamped
    with a bare node id is durably written, readable through the ledger reader, and **invisible in
    the runs surface** — the "(visible in the runs surface)" half of the skip contract silently
    unmet. A row nobody can find answers "why did nothing run?" to nobody, so an absent path is
    refused here rather than guessed.

    Raises `ValueError` on an empty rationale or an empty `instance_path`. That is the whole point
    of the record: a row saying "skipped" with no reason — or no reachable home — is the silence
    this function exists to prevent, and letting it through would make the surface look healthy
    while being useless.
