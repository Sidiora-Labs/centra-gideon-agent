"""Commit-delta state for the Self-QA watcher (SELF-VERIFICATION §3.1, SV-11).

The Wave-2 companion shipped this logic inside a sandboxed cron script
(``crons/selfqa_commit_watch.py``) because no vcs trigger existed yet. AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's
``vcs`` preset now does (:func:`gideon.automation.triggers.file_watch.vcs_patterns` watches
``.git/refs/heads/*`` + ``.git/HEAD``), so the interim script retires and the delta logic
lives HERE — in-process, with real package access, freed of the sandbox constraints the
script's own docstring catalogued (stub ``gideon`` module, allowlisted env, config
smuggled through a file beside the script).

What a fire means is unchanged from the script, clause for clause:

- **First sight of a repo records HEAD and stays quiet** — enabling the companion must not
  fire a run against whatever commit happened to be checked out.
- **State advances BEFORE the run starts** — a run that fails downstream must not re-fire
  the same commits on the next change; a watcher that retries a failing run on every fire
  is how a token budget disappears overnight.
- **An unknown ``last_sha`` (rebase, force-push, fresh clone) reports just HEAD** — the
  honest answer: one commit is provably new and nothing before it is provable.
- **At most :data:`MAX_COMMITS_PER_FIRE` SHAs per fire, newest kept** — a watcher that was
  off for a week should not open a hundred-commit run; the state still advances past the
  backlog so it cannot re-fire.
