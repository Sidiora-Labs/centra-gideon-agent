"""Event-trace recorder — dev-only NDJSON capture of live event streams.

Part of the Self-Verification event-trace replay substrate. This is the ONE piece that
lives in core (the harness that *consumes* traces is repo-inner dev infra and can't be
imported by core). It is a thin, opt-in tap at existing event chokepoints:

- **off by default, zero overhead:** recording is enabled only when ``GIDEON_TRACE_DIR``
  is set in the environment. When unset, :func:`record` returns immediately after a single
  cached-None check — no file I/O, no formatting, no import cost on the hot path.
- **redacted at write time:** every payload passes through ``security.redact`` (credentials
  + exfiltration URLs) because traces get checked into ``harness/traces/`` as fixtures.
- **one NDJSON line per event:** ``{ts, stream, key, seq?, type, payload}``. Files are
  ``<trace_dir>/<stream>-<key>.ndjson`` (one per stream+key), append-only.

This module deliberately has NO dependency on the harness and imports only stdlib +
``gideon.security.security`` — so wrapping a chokepoint with a ``record(...)`` call adds a
dev-only capability without coupling core to dev tooling.
