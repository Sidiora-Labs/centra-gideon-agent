"""The experiment-matrix CHILD entrypoint (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §1.2/§1.3).

``run_matrix`` (:mod:`gideon.assurance.evals.runner`) spawns one of these per cell:

    python -m gideon.assurance.evals.child <descriptor.json>

The §1.3 isolation fix lives HERE by construction: the parent sets
``GIDEON_WORKSPACE`` in *this child's* spawn env only, so this process is
already pointed at the per-cell workspace before any code runs. We reuse
:class:`~gideon.assurance.eval.runner.EvalRunner` unchanged (``workspace_dir=`` reads
the same path), run ONE cell's scenario, and emit its raw result as a
sentinel-prefixed JSON line on stdout for the parent to read back. The parent
process's ``os.environ`` is never mutated — that is the whole point of §1.3.

ES-6 adds one more thing this child does before the run: it stages the Loop-2 gate's
before/after ARM (:mod:`gideon.assurance.evals.gate`) into its throwaway home, so the candidate
artifact under test exists only inside this cell.

One more stager runs last: when — and ONLY when — the caller declared one, the child applies
the cell's provider binding (:mod:`gideon.assurance.evals.cell_provider`) into the same throwaway
home, so a cell can reach one real model for one use case. With no binding declared the
child's env carries no provider and no credential at all, and the offline ``scripted``
fixture is the only model it can resolve.

Crash / infra-error contract: any failure emits an ``{"ok": false}`` result AND
exits non-zero, so the parent maps the cell to ``VERIFIER_ABSENT`` (never a false
``FAILED``). A clean scenario run emits ``{"ok": true, "passed": ..., "score": ...}``.

    """This cell's model spend, read from its OWN throwaway home before it is destroyed.

    ``guardrails/audit.py`` writes one line per attempt into ``config_dir()/model_calls.jsonl``.
    That file lives in the cell's ``GIDEON_HOME`` — a ``TemporaryDirectory`` the parent
    deletes on exit — so the token denominator the honest verdict needs was being computed and
    then thrown away (protocol §7 G4). Folding it into the payload here is what makes it
    survive: the parent persists this dict verbatim into the cell artifact under the real home.

    ``estimated`` is carried through and never dropped. ``AttemptRecord.estimated`` exists to
    say "dollars/tokens are heuristic, not provider-reported", and §4 requires any published
    ratio to carry that word.

    ``observed`` is the load-bearing field: ``False`` means the audit file was absent or
    unreadable, which is NOT the same fact as zero spend. A reader that cannot tell those
    apart would publish "this arm was free" about a measurement that never happened.

    ``tokens_recorded`` is the SECOND load-bearing field, and it exists because ``observed``
    was not enough (#2540). An attempt that COMPLETED cleanly always consumed prompt tokens, so
    a completed attempt reporting a zero total did not report its usage at all — Ollama's
    OpenAI-compatible endpoint intermittently omits the ``usage`` block, ``llm/openai.py`` starts
    its counters at 0, and ``guardrails/model_call.py`` coerces the absent value to 0 before the
    audit row is written. Measured on ``main``: that cell came back
    ``{observed: true, attempts: 2, tokens: 0}`` — byte-identical to a cell whose two attempts
    genuinely spent nothing because neither completed. So the token totals here are ``None``
    (:data:`~gideon.assurance.evals.provenance.UNRECORDED`, never ``0``) the moment one contributing
    attempt did not report its usage, and ``unrecorded_attempts`` says how many.

    ``dollars_est`` is NOT nulled with them, deliberately. It is a real estimate over a real
    attempt; only the token count is absent. That asymmetry is exactly why #2630 refused to widen
    ``priced`` to cover token counts, and why ``tokens_recorded`` is its own word."""
