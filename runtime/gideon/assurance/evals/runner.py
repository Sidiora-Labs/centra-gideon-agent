"""The experiment-matrix RUNNER (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §1.2/§1.3).

``run_matrix`` expands a :class:`~gideon.assurance.evals.matrix.MatrixSpec` into the
cartesian product of its axes × ``trial_count``, and executes each cell
**sequentially** in a **spawned child process** (:mod:`gideon.assurance.evals.child`)
whose ``GIDEON_WORKSPACE`` points at a fresh per-cell temp workspace. The
parent gateway's ``os.environ`` is NEVER mutated — that is the §1.3 isolation fix,
achieved by constructing the child env at spawn (precedent:
``schedule_script.run_script_sandboxed``).

That construction is a BUILD, not a copy: :func:`gideon.security.sandbox.build_child_env`
composes the child env from the measured name ALLOWLIST, so nothing a cell may reach is
there merely because the launching shell happened to export it. What a cell needs beyond
that floor it gets by NAME — see :data:`_FORWARDED_ENV_NAMES` and
:mod:`gideon.assurance.evals.cell_provider`.

Three-state outcome mapping (§1.2), the load-bearing contract:

* the child ran and reported ``passed`` ⇒ ``PASSED`` / ``FAILED`` with its score;
* the SpendMeter preflight says ``EXCEEDED`` ⇒ ``VERIFIER_ABSENT`` (couldn't run
  within budget), and NO child is spawned;
* the child timed out / exited non-zero / emitted unparseable output ⇒
  ``VERIFIER_ABSENT`` — an infra failure is never averaged in as a ``0`` score.

The runner never raises out: a cell's infra failure becomes a ``VERIFIER_ABSENT``
cell, not an exception that aborts the whole matrix. Every cell's raw artifact is
retained under ``matrices/<id>/`` so a surprising aggregate is always drillable.

    ``aggregates.json`` + ``trials.json``, appends a ``results.tsv`` row, and
    SEL-logs matrix-run start + completion (best-effort).

    ``artifact_arm`` (ES-6) is the Loop-2 gate's before/after arm: a set of home-relative files
    the CHILD stages into its throwaway home. It is threaded here rather than given its own
    runner because a second spawn path would be a second isolation contract to keep true.

    ``provider_binding`` is the model grant the CALLER declares for this run: one use case
    bound to one ``Provider:model`` ref, applied by the child inside its throwaway home. It
    is an explicit parameter rather than a field on the spec because it is a property of
    THIS invocation's environment, not of the experiment being described — an
    ``experiment.json`` that hardcoded an endpoint would stop being reproducible elsewhere.
    Omit it and every cell resolves the offline ``scripted`` fixture, exactly as before.

    ES-2: the pin is computed FIRST, before any cell runs, and persisted as
    ``matrices/<id>/pin.json``. A scenario that cannot be resolved — or that names a
    fixture home that does not ship — raises
    :class:`~gideon.assurance.evals.scenarios.ScenarioLibraryError` out of here, on

    scores.

    #2561: ``compute_pin`` reads the INVOKING HOME's ``active_models.json`` and never saw
    ``provider_binding``, so a bound run and a run where every cell failed with
    ``ProviderResolutionError`` carried the identical ``model_fp``. What the CELLS could reach is
