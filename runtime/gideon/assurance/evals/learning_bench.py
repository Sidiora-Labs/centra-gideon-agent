"""The skill-impact benchmark: the frozen task register, its reports, and V4 reproduction.

`docs/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` is PROTOCOL v1 — owner-signed on
2026-08-16, before any run, including the commitment to publish a modest or negative result.
This module is the shipped half of executing it: the frozen ten-task register, the preflight
that says whether a paired run is runnable *before* a model is called, report persistence, and
the §8 reproduction predicate.

**What is deliberately NOT here: the verdict.** The protocol's §5 thresholds live in
`harness/fanout_measure.py`, and `harness` is a repo-root dev package that does not ship in the
wheel — so importing it from `src/` would strand an import at install time. The verdict is
computed by the runner (`scripts/learning_benchmark.py`, through `harness/learning_verdict.py`)
and **written into the report**. Everything downstream — this module, the gateway route, the
dashboard panel — only ever READS a verdict string.

That is not a workaround, it is the property worth having. A surface that cannot recompute a
verdict cannot invent one. A report with no verdict therefore renders as *"not measured"*, and
the one failure mode this benchmark most needs to avoid — drawing `0.000` where nothing was
measured, turning "we never asked" into "it scored nothing" — is unreachable by construction.

Isolation: every paired trial runs as a matrix cell in a spawned child whose
``GIDEON_HOME`` is a per-cell temp dir seeded from the scenario's declared
``fixture_home``. Nothing here reads or writes the operator's skills. The protocol's §3 forbids
`gideon eval` for benchmark runs for exactly that reason — it isolates the workspace but
not the home — and this module never reaches it.
