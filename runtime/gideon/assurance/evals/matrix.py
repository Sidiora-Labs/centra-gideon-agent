"""Experiment-matrix TYPES (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §1.2).

One matrix runner is meant to serve five consumers (studies, ablation, retrieval,
judge benchmark, bake-off). ES-1a defines only the TYPES those consumers share —
the spec, the per-cell result, the whole-matrix result, and the three-state
aggregation. The ``run_matrix`` execution body (subprocess spawning, per-cell
timeouts, cost preflight) is ES-1b; nothing here spawns a process or calls a model.

The three-state outcome is load-bearing: an infra error / timeout / ``None`` reward
is ``VERIFIER_ABSENT``, never a zero score. :func:`aggregate` computes the mean over
``PASSED``/``FAILED`` cells ONLY and reports ``verifier_absent`` as a separate count,
so an unrunnable check can never be averaged in as a failure.
