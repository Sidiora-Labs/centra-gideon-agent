"""Loop-3 live field metrics beside lab results + ``lab_field_divergence`` (E3 / ES-9).

Amendment E3's contract, verbatim: *"Loop 3 — live quality (field): derived metrics,
computed by query, stored nowhere new (the §4.4 discipline): per-template/per-action-type
👍/👎 rate + edit-before-approve rate from plan 58's FEEDBACK-SIGNAL store, plus
approval/rejection/undo rates from the earned-autonomy ledger. Rendered BESIDE lab results
on the §10 Learning-page tab — one row per subject: lab score (Loop 1, pinned) | gate
status (Loop 2) | field trend (Loop 3). A subject whose lab score rose while its field
trend fell is flagged ``lab_field_divergence`` — the honest "should-be vs is" check, and a
§4.2 trust-record demotion signal."*

**Everything here is a query.** No file is written by any function in this module except
through the demotion machinery that already exists (``autonomy.demote`` via
``ladder.revoke_scope``/``revoke_granted_scopes``). The sources are all shipped records:

* 👍/👎 — FEEDBACK-SIGNAL's ``feedback.jsonl`` current verdicts, attributed by
  ``producer_id == subject`` — the SAME attribution :func:`gideon.security.guardrails.
  autonomy._feedback_rejections` already uses, so the field row and the ladder's own
  evidence can never disagree about whose thumbs these are.
* edit-before-approve — the run journal's ``user_edited_mid_flight`` events against
  human-answered gates (plan 58 defers explicit edit records as an open question; the
  journal event is the flywheel's own "gold" edit signal, and it exists today).
  Template-scoped only: no record anywhere captures an edit on an action type's output,
  so that cell is ``None`` — *not measured*, never ``0.0``.
* approvals/rejections/undos — the SEL approval verdicts through
  :func:`gideon.security.guardrails.autonomy.approval_outcome_series` (one attribution
  dialect, again) plus the reversal records ``guardrails.ladder`` keeps for undo.
* lab score (Loop 1) — the newest ``results.tsv`` study row for the subject, pin and all.
* gate status (Loop 2) — the newest gate report attached to a proposal targeting the
  subject, projected through the SAME :func:`gideon.assurance.evals.gate.summary` the inbox
  row renders.

**The divergence is the point.** ``lab_field_divergence`` flags a subject whose newest lab
measurement ROSE (``score_new > score_old``) while its live field trend is ``falling`` and
the field evidence postdates the lab row — lab said "better", the user's own verdicts say
"worse", which voids the "the system behaves well" premise behind any standing autonomy
grant. :func:`sweep_lab_field_divergence` files the §4.2 demotion mechanically: a
divergent action type loses its OWN standing grant (:func:`gideon.security.guardrails.ladder.
revoke_scope`), and a divergent template revokes standing grants wholesale
(:func:`~gideon.security.guardrails.ladder.revoke_granted_scopes`) — the same consequence a
failed §2 study and a nodding gate already carry, because all three are template-scoped
proof that the evidence autonomy rests on is wrong. Both paths are gated on a standing
grant, which is what makes a STANDING divergence naturally idempotent, and re-granting
always takes a click.
