"""The code map's grammars arrive through the egress guard, and the language pack downloads nothing.

The language pack keeps each language's grammar as a shared library, and the first time a language
is parsed it downloads one by itself: a manifest from its releases on GitHub, then one bundle of
every grammar for this machine, tens of megabytes. Its own client made those requests, where the
egress guard never saw them: a host on Denied hosts was reached all the same, and nothing was
audited.

So the pack reads its manifest from a file in the home (``library_env``:
``TREE_SITTER_LANGUAGE_PACK_MANIFEST_URL``), which only this module writes, and with no file there
it fails before it reaches anything. :func:`ensure` fetches the manifest and the bundle through
``net.fetch``, under the connector policy with the owner's Network egress settings on it: a refused
host is never contacted, every redirect is checked again, and every request is audited. It checks
the bundle against the size and digest the manifest gives, and writes the manifest with the
bundle's address on this machine. The pack then copies the bundle into its cache, checks its digest
itself, and unpacks the grammar it was asked for; the copy here is removed once the pack holds its
own. The manifest names only files on this machine, so the pack can never reach the network, even
for a language nothing has asked for yet. The processes on one home fetch once between them: a fetch
holds the grammar folder's lock, and the others wait for it and use what it unpacked.
