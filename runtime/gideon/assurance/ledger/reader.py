    Budgets are PRE-CHARGED from this on resume (WF2-R4 invariant #1): a resumed run
    must inherit what it already spent, or a crash loop becomes an unbounded spend.

    ``priced`` is the money figure's own disclosure, and it exists because this primitive has TWO
    producers writing through it and only one of them books a cost. A workflow
    ``step_completed`` always carries ``cost_usd`` (``workflows/journal.py::Journal.step_completed``
    writes it, ``0.0`` for a free local model — a real observation). A LOOP ``step_completed``
    carries no cost key at all (``loop/journal.py::LoopJournal.cycle``): loop money lives in
    ``usage/turns.jsonl`` and ``loop/manager.py::loop_spend`` reads it there, deliberately, because
    booking it here too would be one dollar in two stores. Seeding at zero and summing
    ``.get("cost_usd", 0.0)`` therefore reported every loop that has ever run as free — the same
    number a genuinely-free local run reports, with no key distinguishing them.

    The word is :mod:`gideon.operations.usage_ledger`'s, not a new one, and it means exactly what it
    means there: ``priced=False`` ⇒ ``cost_usd`` is a **FLOOR**, and a caller MUST render it
    "not recorded" / "at least this much", never ``$0.00``. Folded the same way too — one unpriced
    constituent taints the total (``usage_ledger._fold``), and a ledger with no completed steps
    reports ``priced=True`` like ``usage_ledger._blank_agg`` does, because "nothing completed" is
    already said by ``steps_completed: 0`` and needs no second hedge.

    ``cost_usd`` stays a plain ``float`` rather than ``float | None``: the sum is legitimately a
    float and every caller's arithmetic depends on it. The honesty rides beside the number, not
    inside it. (``introspection.RailTotals`` makes the other trade for a single run's rail — see
    its docstring for why the two differ.)

    ``tokens`` has the same absent-vs-zero shape and is deliberately NOT covered by ``priced``:
    ``priced`` is a claim about MONEY in both money surfaces, and widening it to mean "and the
    token count is a floor too" would give one word two meanings. See #2566.
