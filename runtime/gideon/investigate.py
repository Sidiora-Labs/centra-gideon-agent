"""Investigate Anywhere — one chat-with-context primitive for every entity row (plan 60).

Every entity row gets an **investigate** affordance that opens a chat pre-loaded
with that entity's full context. One shared primitive:

* a per-kind **resolver registry** — the owning module registers a pure-read
  function that composes an :class:`InvestigateContext` (typed envelope: kind, id,
  title, snapshot, back-link, suggested agent + task mode, opening prompt) from
  its own store. A client can't forge a snapshot — composition is server-side.
* ``POST /api/investigate`` creates a fresh chat session in ``ask`` mode (read-only
  investigation — propose-don't-write), stages the envelope on the session, and
  returns the session key.
* at the session's FIRST turn, ``chat_runner._inject_investigate_context`` prepends
  the envelope to the model-bound message — ``fence_untrusted`` wrapped, DATA not
  instructions — exactly like the knowledge/attachment injections. The user's
  visible message stays clean, and the user always fires the first turn.

Soul guardrails: resolvers are PURE READS (investigating never mutates the
entity); the envelope always passes ``fence_untrusted`` before reaching a prompt;
no surface grows its own bespoke "chat about this" wiring.
