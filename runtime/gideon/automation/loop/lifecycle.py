"""Scratch-workspace lifecycle for loops (auto-campaign-scratch-workspace).

A loop owns a scratch dir (``config_dir()/loop/<id>/`` — its findings, briefs, and
document deliverable). By default that dir PERSISTS after the loop finishes (never
auto-delete a user's work). When a loop is created with ``auto_teardown_on_complete``,
the dir is treated as disposable scratch and removed once the loop reaches a terminal
state — but ONLY after the completion path has already **graduated** the deliverable
to the permanent Artifacts library (``watchdog._register_deliverable_artifact``). So
the report survives even for a torn-down scratch loop; only the raw scratch is reclaimed.

An externally-bound ``workspace_dir`` (the user's own codebase) is NEVER auto-torn-down
— teardown is scoped strictly to the loop's own dir.
