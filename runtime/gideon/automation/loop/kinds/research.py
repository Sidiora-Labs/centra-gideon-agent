"""Research kind — deep, iterative web research toward a synthesized report.

A specialization of the open-ended Goal loop (it reuses Goal's separate-judge
done-ness, granularity dial, walkthrough, validation, and task decomposition —
no agent certifies its own research). What differs is the *subject-matter
expertise*: the worker runs a **deep-research plan** with a dynamically evolving
set of subtopics, searches the web + fetches article content, and synthesizes
findings into an output whose **template and manner are dictated by the user's
request** — scaling to as many sources as the signal demands.

The novelty over a plain open-ended goal is the per-cycle research discipline
encoded in the brief + cycle nudge (expand/prune subtopics, breadth-then-depth,
source accounting, evidence-first synthesis) and a research-shaped kind_config
(``subtopics`` / ``output_template`` / ``output_manner`` / ``source_budget``).
Engine-agnostic: this is just another ``LoopKindStrategy`` + one ``register()``.
