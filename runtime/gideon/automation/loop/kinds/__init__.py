"""Per-kind loop strategies — where subject-matter expertise lives.

The unified engine (store/manager/watchdog) is kind-agnostic. Everything that
varies by :class:`gideon.automation.loop.loop.LoopKind` — how a task is classified,
how the problem is phased, which capabilities load, how the worker brief is
framed, which planning-walkthrough config is used — is supplied by a
:class:`LoopKindStrategy` registered here.

A new kind = a new strategy module + one ``register()`` call. No engine edits, no
entity columns. This is the seam that lets all kinds share loop + project features
while keeping rich, type-specific behavior.

**The SUPERVISOR is no longer part of that seam** (`PP-16` seam 3). How done-ness
is gated, whether a budget stop is genuine, and whether the stall signal applies
are DECLARED in
:data:`gideon.automation.workflows.supervisor_policy.KIND_CONVERGENCE` and evaluated by
the one kind-agnostic evaluator in :mod:`gideon.automation.loop.supervisor`. A kind may
not supply a convergence mechanism in Python — the closed
:data:`~gideon.automation.workflows.supervisor_policy.DONE_SIGNALS` vocabulary is the
whole contract. What remains here is intake, worker framing and projection keys.
