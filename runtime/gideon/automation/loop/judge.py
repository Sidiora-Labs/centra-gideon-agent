"""The judge subagent — the third-party cycle assessor (§5.4).

A dedicated, **separate** agent — never the worker, never a member of a
multi-agent roster — assesses each cycle's output for the open-ended (§5.2) and
stuck-detector (§5.1) paths. It is the mechanism that lets us assess done-ness
with an LLM *without* violating VISION's tenet: it has no stake in the work,
having not produced it. The worker only *produces*; the judge *advises*; the
supervisor (deterministic) *decides*.

It receives the goal/DoD + the cycle's finding + a compact digest of prior
findings and emits a structured verdict:

    {done, done_reason, marginal_value (0-5), quality_score (0-5), regressed}

It runs in its own session with no write tools — it reads and judges, it doesn't
act. Built on the eval :class:`LLMJudge` (the same provider seam the ratchet
already uses) but with its own done-ness + marginal-value rubric.

**The verdict object is the contract's, not this module's (WF2LOO-16).** There used to be a
private ``CycleVerdict`` here — a third vocabulary over one decision, alongside the two
`WF2LOO-13` already merged. It is DELETED: `assess_cycle` returns a
:class:`~gideon.automation.workflows.judge_contract.JudgeVerdict`, the boolean ``done`` above is
projected onto the closed enum by the contract's single `verdict_for_cycle`, and the asymmetric
skeptic merge lives with the fields it merges (`judge_contract.adjudicate`). The loop's own
addition to the contract is evidence: `_observe_ground_truth` is unchanged, and
:func:`evidence_refs_from_observation` turns what it observed into the contract's
``evidence_refs`` — proof the SUPERVISOR gathered, not a claim the worker made.
