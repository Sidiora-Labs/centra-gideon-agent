"""Deterministic template lint — the conventions check (WF2-R15).

`validate_spec` answers "will the engine run this?". This answers a different question: "does
this template follow the conventions that keep a growing library coherent?" A spec can be
perfectly valid and still be a bad template — no description to choose it by, an input with no
help text, a Finding record written by hand instead of cited, no mid-flight steering example.

Why a lint rather than more validation rules: these are **authoring** standards, not run
requirements. Making them validation errors would refuse a user's own half-finished workflow,
which is theirs to leave rough. Making them nothing at all is how a six-template library becomes
a twelve-template library where four templates each define severity differently.

Deterministic on purpose — no model call. Every finding is a structural fact about the spec, so
the lint gives the same answer in CI as on a laptop, and the CI failure names the exact template
and node.

Severity here means:

* **error** — would mislead or block a user of the template (a duplicated convention that has
  already drifted, a reference that cannot resolve);
* **warning** — a real gap worth fixing before shipping (no steering example, thin description).

The `bundled` library is held to `error`-free AND `warning`-free by test. A user's own template is
only ever advised.
