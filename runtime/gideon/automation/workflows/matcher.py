"""Tiered template matching — deterministic first, embeddings as a tie-breaker, LLM last.

The system this replaces made one embedding call and took the top cosine hit. That fails three
ways at once: it cannot explain itself, it cannot run offline, and a 0.51 winner beats a 0.49
runner-up with no acknowledgement that the two were indistinguishable.

**Five tiers, cheapest first, and every tier can answer alone.**

* **T1 — keyword index** over each template's `keywords[]`. Deterministic, offline, auditable, and
  free. Most intents are decided here.
* **T2 — metadata scoring** over tags, name, description and example OUTPUTS. Outputs matter more
  than descriptions: a user's intent resembles what they want to END UP with far more than it
  resembles prose about a workflow.
* **T3 — shape filter** from the intent classifier's tuple. A monitor-shaped intent should not
  match a one-shot template however well its words line up.
* **T4 — embeddings, demoted to TIE-BREAKER.** Used only when the top candidates are within
  `TIE_BAND`, which is the one case where the deterministic tiers genuinely cannot choose.
* **T5 — an LLM that RE-ENTERS the deterministic scorer.** It summarizes the intent; it never
  emits a template id. A model naming a template directly can name one that does not exist, and a
  fuzzy-resolved hallucination is worse than no match because it looks like an answer.

**Every decision carries a reason string.** A router nobody can audit is one nobody can correct,
and "why did it pick that?" is the first question anyone asks.

**Nothing here hard-fails offline.** T4 needs an embedder and T5 needs a model; both are optional
and their absence degrades to the tier below with a recorded reason.
