"""The run controller — one conductor per run, and the only writer of run state.

Everything about this module follows from one rule: **a run has exactly one writer**
(WF2-R10). The tick loop under `self._lock` is it. Nothing else — not a dispatcher, not
a watchdog, not an HTTP handler — writes a terminal status. Handlers request; the loop
decides and writes.

That rule is what makes the harder features tractable later. Mid-flight mutation (Slice
4) can only be safe if there is a well-defined moment when no node is being scheduled;
here that moment is "between scheduling steps, holding the lock". Crash recovery can only
be correct if terminal writes are serialized, or a resumed run and a still-dying task
race to disagree about the outcome.

The loop is deliberately boring:

    while not terminal:
        drain cancel intent
        compute frontier (pure)
        launch admitted work
        await *something* finishing
        apply results, persist state

`asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)` is what keeps it responsive without polling: a fast
transform does not wait behind a ten-minute stage. `WAITING` nodes hold no lane and are
woken by deadline, so a run parked on an approval for six hours costs nothing.

**Budget pre-charge (WF2-R4 invariant).** A resumed run inherits spend from its ledger
before scheduling anything. Minting a fresh budget on resume would turn a crash loop into
unbounded spend — the exact failure the cap exists to prevent.

        greedy preserve pattern fatal precisely because they cannot be honored, and honoring
        neither means running in a mode nobody chose. An ignored fatal issue is the inert-control
        shape this program keeps finding, so it terminates the run through `_finish` (the single
        terminal writer) instead of degrading quietly.

        multi-hour run would tie the workspace to this process's lifetime, so a gateway restart
        would strand it. What the lock actually protects is the provisioning WINDOW — the
        preserve+setup pass, where two processes writing the same tree corrupt each other. Live
        contention refuses the run rather than queueing: two runs interleaving writes in one
        worktree is worse than telling the second one now.

        Idempotent, because `_prepare` runs again on resume: `add_worktree` returns the same path
        for an existing run id (measured), setup is marker-guarded and content-addressed, and
        preserve is an overwriting copy. The second pass is therefore cheap and safe rather than a
        second workspace.

        Guarded on everything except the deliberate refusal: a provisioning bug must cost the
        isolation, never the run — a run that cannot start because a scratch dir failed to `mkdir`
        would be strictly worse than one that runs in the project workspace and says so.

        The run already carries the inherited mode in `extra` (stamped by `start_run`); this is the
        moment it becomes ENFORCED in the process-global `session_restrictions` registry — the fast
        path the knowledge/learning writers consult during the run. The chat layer never marks the
        registry (it enforces off `session.is_restricted` on the LIVE session object, which a
        background run no longer holds), so this is the registry's FIRST writer for a run's keys.

        The mark is made for BOTH the launching session key AND the run-owned key: the origin key is
        what the run-end LearningGate reads (`_capture_run_end` keys `for_session` off
        `origin.session_key`), and the owned key is what any run-scoped write would carry. A
        `temporary` run gets both marks per `restriction_calls`, because `is_temporary` gates reads
        while `is_restricted` gates writes.

        **Durability lives in `run.extra`, not a session JSONL.** A run owns no `ConversationLog`
        file — stage subagents persist under their own `subagent:<id>` keys, and the `workflow:`
        owned string is a provenance ref, not a JSONL key. The run record's `extra["memory_mode"]`
        IS the run's durable metadata head: `start_run` stamps it via `ownership.stamp_run_mode`,
        which is `ownership.durable_metadata` (same `memory_mode` key by construction, not two
        literals). It round-trips through the run record on disk and is what a gateway restart
        replays — after which `_prepare` runs again and re-marks the registry from it, and the
        engine's node-skip + the run-end gate keep reading it. Materializing an owned-session JSONL
        line would create a file no reader consumes (the reindex path forgets restricted sessions on
        sight), so the durable write is deliberately the `extra` head. DEVIATION from the literal
        "JSONL write" phrasing, recorded in the plan's Execution log.

        Idempotent and best-effort: `_prepare` runs once per live controller and again on resume,

        This is the third answer to a waiting gate, and the reason it has to exist: a reviewer who

        re-rolls the twelve stages nobody complained about (the same argument `revision.py` makes
        about regeneration).

        Mirrors `planning.session.comment_step`'s awaiting_review → running semantics (a comment
        sends the step back for a re-draft rather than accepting the artifact), with the engine's
        own state names: the gate instance goes back to PENDING at the current epoch, not DONE, so
        it re-asks against the revised step. It is deliberately NOT an approval — nothing is marked
        approved, no `always_allow` is remembered, and no `gate_resolved` is journaled, because the
        gate has not been answered yet.

        EVERY refusal here happens before the token is consumed. The whole point of a revise is that
        the reviewer is still deciding, so a rejected revise must leave them able to answer.

        `dispatch_stage` spawns and returns RUNNING immediately (``engine.py:777``), so by the
        time that result is applied the awaited asyncio task is ALREADY done: `_await_progress`
        pops the entry out of `_inflight` (:2686) before `_apply` sees it, and the tick loop
        then takes the idle branch (:573) that never calls `_await_progress` again.
        `_enforce_stall_timeouts` is reachable only from there (:2682), so it stopped being able
        to observe the node at all; `node_timeout_total` never could, because it bounds the
        awaited dispatcher coroutine (:2539) and for a stage that coroutine ends at the spawn.
        The result was a node that stayed RUNNING with no `step_completed` after its subagent
        had reported `done: True` — which hung every template containing a `stage`.

        **`_inflight` is deliberately NOT the home for a dispatched stage.** Every consumer of
        that dict assumes `entry.task` is a live awaitable: `_await_progress` selects on it with
        FIRST_COMPLETED, and both the stall sweep and `_cancel_inflight` cancel it. Re-inserting
        an already-finished task would make `asyncio.wait` return instantly on every tick and
        re-apply the same RUNNING result forever; parking a never-resolving placeholder there
        instead would mean inventing a fake task to satisfy a signature. A spawned subagent is
        not an awaited task. What the controller legitimately owns is the ID of the work, and
        that is instance state — exactly like `wake_at`.

        **One source of truth for liveness.** "Has this subagent finished?" stays owned by
        `DelegationSupervisor.get` (``subagent.py:1632``), the same lookup the sessions surface reads
        (``dashboard/handlers/sessions.py:388``). Nothing is registered here. That also settles
        the HUNG case without a second deadline: the manager's own reaper (``subagent.py:739``)
        force-kills a child past `_default_timeout` and records the verdict as `done=True` with
        `error="Reaped after ..."` (:791-793). That deadline already existed and was merely
        unread — so this method is a READER, not a new timeout.

        `design-project.refine` asks 600s, `general-project.project` 900s,
        `goal-pursuit-open-ended.work` 900s and `goal-pursuit-verifiable.work` 1200s — and
        `_enforce_stall_timeouts` consulted only `services.node_timeout_stall`, so every one of them
        silently got the 300s default and a legitimately slow node was killed as wedged.

        That is the WRONG DIRECTION to fail in. `timeout_stall` is supposed to mean "silent", not
        "slow" (the heartbeat in `engine._wait_with_progress` exists precisely to keep that
        distinction), and a node whose author measured it needing 20 minutes being cancelled at 5 is
        the failure the knob was added to prevent.

        A node may only RAISE its window, never lower it below the run default: that value is the
        operator's floor for how long a silent node may sit, and letting a template shorten it would
        let a bundled spec tighten an operator's policy. Zero/invalid falls back to the default
        rather than disabling the check — a malformed knob must not switch a safety timeout off.

        `node_outputs` does. Only SUCCESS states contribute — a failed node's leftover ref must
