"""Bench-only skill suppression (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §3.3).

The §3.3 impact bench replays a skill's consulted runs with that skill **surfaced vs
suppressed**. The comparison only means anything if suppression genuinely removes the
skill from what the model saw — a "suppressed" arm whose prompt still carries the body
measures nothing and reports a delta of 0.0, which reads exactly like a skill that does
not matter.

So suppression is enforced at the ONE choke point every prompt path goes through:
:meth:`gideon.extensions.skills.loader.ProcedureLibrary.load_skill`, the only place a skill body
is read. Force-loaded loop skills, passively surfaced skills, and ``skill_invoke`` all
call it, so a suppressed skill's body cannot reach a prompt through any of them.

The suppression set lives in the PROCESS ENV, not in a file and not in config: it is set
by :func:`gideon.assurance.evals.overlay.apply_in_child` inside a throwaway eval child and
therefore cannot outlive that child or leak into the operator's gateway. An empty/absent
env var means "suppress nothing", which is the shipped behaviour — that equivalence is
what makes this safe to have in the load path at all.
