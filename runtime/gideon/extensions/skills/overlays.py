"""Skill sidecar overlays.

An accepted skill refinement applies as a SIDECAR OVERLAY rather than mutating the base
``SKILL.md``: a single file — ``<skills_dir>/.overlays/<name>.json`` — holds the accepted
refinements (few-shot exemplars + description notes) and is merged onto the base body at LOAD
time. Three properties fall out, all load-bearing:

* **The skill's own file holds only what its author wrote.** A refinement is applied once, from
  here, each time the skill loads, and never written into ``SKILL.md``: every writer of that file
  stores the author's text with any copy of an applied refinement left out of it
  (:func:`without_copies`, through ``SkillsLoader``'s one writer). Two writers used to save the
  skill as it LOADS back into its file — the Skills page's editor and the curator — and the
  refinement then loaded twice, and a revert removed only this copy of it.
* **Revert removes a refinement completely.** Reverting one takes it out of this file, and
  reverting the last (or all) deletes the file, so the skill loads as its author wrote it.
* **`install_guarded` locks stay intact.** The overlay lives OUTSIDE the skill directory, so
  ``verify_skill_integrity`` — which hashes every file *inside* ``<skill>/`` against
  ``.gideon-lock.json`` and flags any extra file as ``added`` — never sees it. The base bytes and
  their hashes are never rewritten, so a marketplace-locked skill stays verifiable.

This mirrors the trivial-rollback property templates get from version pinning (``versions.py``):
the base is immutable, the accepted change is a separate, deletable layer.
