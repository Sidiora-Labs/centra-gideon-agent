"""Refine proposals from a detected stumble — LEARNING-VISIBILITY S3 (the refinement arm).

``after_turn_review.detect_stumble`` decides that a turn used a skill and still went wrong.
This module turns that verdict into ONE reviewable artifact: a ``kind="refine"`` proposal on
the EXISTING queue (``skills/proposals.py``), carrying the refinement body accept will apply
and a unified diff of what applying it does.

Three properties are the whole point, and each is a defect this arm exists not to have:

* **The diff is computed, never claimed.** It is ``difflib`` over (the skill's current
  effective body) vs (that body with the proposed refinement block appended by the SAME
  renderer accept runs — ``overlays.render_block``). So the previewed diff is not a model's
  description of a patch; it is the patch, and a test asserts the post-accept body equals the
  diff's "after" side byte for byte.
* **It is derived at READ time, not stored.** A diff frozen at enqueue time goes stale the
  moment anything else refines the same skill, and a stale diff shown on an approval surface
  is worse than none: the user would approve a change they were not shown.
* **No model runs here.** The body is derived from the turn's own record, so the refinement
  arm's degraded floor is *proposing nothing* rather than guessing. That also makes each
  trigger unit-testable without a provider.

**Propose-don't-write.** Nothing in this module writes a skill. It appends to the review
queue; ``proposals.accept`` — a human action — is the only writer.

**Coordination, not a fork** (LEARNING-FLYWHEEL's refiner statistical gates): the flywheel's
stronger acceptance logic slots in front of the same ``enqueue(kind="refine")`` call and the
same accept path. There is no second queue, no second kind, and no second surface here.
