"""Skill proposals — propose-only auto-skill evolution (skill-evolution-proposal-only).

Auto-skill synthesis used to write straight into the live ``auto/`` skill namespace.
After the documented malicious-skill-drift risk (OpenForge B2), the stance is
**propose, never install**: synthesized skills land in a review QUEUE, and a human
accepts (moves to live) or rejects them. Nothing the system authored autonomously
runs until a person approves it.

A proposal is a JSON record under ``~/.gideon/skills/.proposals/<id>.json``
carrying the synthesized skill (slug/description/triggers/procedure) + provenance +
a **fenced** excerpt of the source trace (so the reviewer sees what drove it without
that text being executable if it's ever re-fed to a model). Accept installs the
proposal — a ``kind="new"`` proposal via the auto-skill writer, a ``kind="refine"``
proposal as a SIDECAR OVERLAY on its named target skill (``overlays.py``; the base
``SKILL.md`` is never rewritten, so a locked skill stays verifiable and revert is a
one-file delete) — and reject drops the record.
The queue is the single sink for autonomous synthesis — there is no auto-install
path (by design).
