# Check Work

You just told the user something was done. This skill answers a different question:
**is it?** Not by re-reading your own message — by observing the artifacts your
message claimed exist.

**The one rule:** every check is a tool call or it is `unverifiable`. There is no
third option. You may never report a check as passing because it "should" pass, or
because a related command passed earlier in the session. Ground truth over
self-report — the same doctrine the loop judge runs on.

## Step 1 — Reconstruct the claims (don't re-derive the task)

Read back over **this session's** recent turns and tool calls and write down what was
*claimed complete*, in the claimer's own words. Quote them.

- "Added `derive_checks()` to `src/gideon/check_work.py`" → a claim about a file's contents.
- "`make lint` is clean" → a claim about a command's exit status.
- "The endpoint returns the new field" → a claim about a running surface.
- "I'll add tests next" → **not a claim.** Intent isn't a claim; skip it.

Claims come from the transcript, not from the task description. If the task said
five things and the session claimed two, you check the two that were claimed.

## Step 2 — Derive 2-4 checks from *those* claims

Each check must be a real command the user could run and watch pass or fail, and it
must be traceable to a specific claim. **Not a generic checklist** — a checklist that
would read the same for any session is a tell that you skipped step 1.

| Claim shape | Check shape |
|---|---|
| a file was written / edited | `test -e <path>`, then `grep -n '<the thing claimed>' <path>` |
| a command passes | re-run that exact command (`make lint`, `python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov <file>`) |
| an endpoint answers | call it (`curl -s localhost:<port>/api/...`) and read the body |
| something was deleted / renamed | `grep -rn '<old name>' <tree>` returns nothing |
| an artifact renders | fetch/open it and confirm the expected content is present |

Prefer the **content** form over the existence form: `grep` for the symbol the claim
named beats `test -e`, because an empty file passes `test -e`.

Two is the floor (one check is not a cross-check); four is the ceiling (past that
you're writing a test suite, and the user asked for a check).

Only commands that exist in this repo. If you cannot name a real command for a claim,
that claim is `unverifiable` — say so. Do not invent a script.

## Step 3 — Run them. Actually run them.

Execute each check with a real tool call and keep the output. Then classify:

- **pass** — it ran and the observed output matches the claim. Evidence = the output
  line (`src/gideon/check_work.py:196: def derive_checks(`), not "confirmed".
- **fail** — it ran and the output contradicts the claim. Evidence = the contradiction
  (`no such file`, `1 failed`, exit 1, an empty grep).
- **unverifiable** — it could not run here (no dev gateway up, no credentials, needs a
  browser, the path is outside the work root). Evidence = *why*, plus what would make
  it verifiable.

A fail is the useful outcome. Report it plainly and immediately; do not soften it,
re-run it until it passes, or quietly fix the artifact and then report a pass — if you
fix something, say that the first run failed and show both runs.

## Step 4 — Report

```
**Check-work: FAIL**

- [PASS] `src/gideon/check_work.py` contains `derive_checks` — `grep -n 'derive_checks' src/gideon/check_work.py`
  - evidence: src/gideon/check_work.py:196: def derive_checks(claims, ...)
- [FAIL] `tests/test_check_work.py` exists — `test -e tests/test_check_work.py`
  - evidence: no such path (the turn claimed tests were added)
- [UNVERIFIABLE] `curl -s localhost:10000/api/config` — no gateway is running here
  - evidence: connection refused; start `make serve` first and re-run
```

Verdict rules: any fail → **FAIL**. No fail and at least one executed pass → **PASS**.
Nothing executed → **UNVERIFIABLE** — an empty report is never a pass.

If fewer than two checks were derivable, say that in one line ("only one claim in this
session was checkable: …") instead of padding the report.

## Scope — light and immediate

This is the **light** half of verification: seconds, current session, the claims that
were just made. It does not read a spec, walk a whole feature, or replay a run. That
depth belongs to the deep QA companion (see `references/qa-boundary.md`); when a
check-work run keeps failing or the user wants whole-feature assurance, hand off there
rather than growing this skill into it.

Unattended SDLC loops run this same derivation automatically after a stage gate passes
when `loops.check_work_stages` is on — same module, same rules, no self-report.
