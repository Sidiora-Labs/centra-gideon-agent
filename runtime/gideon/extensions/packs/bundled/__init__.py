"""Bundled first-party Domain OS packs — the authoring path (AGENT-PACKS §4.1, AP-4).

Two packs ship in the wheel: **Personal CFO** (budget-review template + a spending-digest
trigger + finance skills + a finance-category connector requirement + a CFO roster) and
**Health OS** (checkup-cadence trigger + journaling template + health skills + a health
roster). They are the reference for third-party authors and the acceptance test for the whole
mechanism (§Success 1): each one exports, wipes, and imports onto a fresh
``GIDEON_HOME`` with its skills locked, its template runnable, its trigger DISABLED,
its connector prompting configure-or-substitute, and its setup interview asking for a folder.

**Why a source tree and not a checked-in ``.gideon``.** A binary ZIP in the repo is a file
nobody can review in a diff and nobody can regenerate from anything. So the packs live as
plain source trees under ``packs/bundled/<name>/`` and :func:`build_bundled` assembles one on
demand. That assembly IS the export leg of the round trip: it runs the same content-layer
secret scan (:func:`packs.build._scan_component`) over every shipped member and derives the
same ``sha256``/``content_hash`` provenance :func:`packs.build.build_pack` derives, so the
archive an importer verifies is produced by one derivation, not two.

**The author declares edges; the builder derives hashes.** Each pack's ``pack.json`` lists
``components`` with ``kind``/``id``/``path``/``depends_on`` and NO hashes — hand-maintained
hashes drift the moment someone edits a skill. The builder fills them in, and fails closed
in both directions: a declared component with no file, or a component-shaped file nobody
declared, raises rather than shipping a pack that quietly differs from its manifest.
