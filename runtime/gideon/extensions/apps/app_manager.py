"""App Platform lifecycle — install / enable / disable / uninstall (A1).

The runtime is Gideon-native, built on top of
the existing manifest (:mod:`apps.manifest`) + storage primitives
(:mod:`apps.manager`). Turns "read what's present" into a real, safety-gated
lifecycle:

* **install(source)** — copy → **stage in quarantine** → validate manifest →
  **scan staged content** (the shared :class:`SkillScanner` gate; ``dangerous``
  is terminal, non-overridable) → require consent for risky verdicts → run
  ``setup.onInstall`` (bounded subprocess) → register providers → write
  ``installed.json``.
* **enable / disable(name)** — run ``setup.onEnable``/``onDisable`` (bounded),
  flip the provider registration.

Removal is a THREE-rung ladder, and each rung is a different promise about the
user's ``data/`` — the notes they wrote, a campaign's ledger, an incident log:

* **uninstall(name)** — DEACTIVATE. Nothing leaves disk; the app is turned off.
* **uninstall_keep_data(name)** — the app's files go, ``data/`` is KEPT (parked at
  ``apps/.{name}.data``) and a later ``install`` of the same name puts it back. It
  REFUSES while an earlier unconsumed copy of that ``data/`` is still on disk, rather
  than deleting or overwriting one — :func:`_unconsumed_data_copies` owns that question.
* **force_uninstall(name)** — everything goes, ``data/`` included.

The middle rung exists because the first two alone force a choice between leaving a
dead app installed forever and destroying the user's data (issue #2541).

Every lifecycle action is SEL-audited. Executing a third-party ``setup`` hook is
RCE-by-design, so a hook only runs after the scanner passes (or the caller gives
explicit consent for a ``warning``) — never on a ``dangerous`` verdict, and never
auto-forced for an unattended/agent-initiated install.

Atomic update + rollback is A2; the dependency ledger is A3; this is the core.

    * :func:`uninstall_keep_data` treated an existing STAGE as leftover garbage and

      in exactly one case: a park that failed, where the stage is the user's LAST copy
      (#2574). So the one state the sweep could ever find was the one it must not touch.
    * the same function ``rmtree``'d an existing PARK before moving the new copy over it.
      A park coexists with an installed app only when an earlier restore FAILED, so that
      copy is data the user has never seen — and the delete was ``ignore_errors=True``,
      so when it silently failed instead, ``shutil.move`` found a directory at the
      destination and moved the stage INSIDE it, reporting success.
    * :func:`force_uninstall` — which the middle rung calls to do its removal — discards
      any park for the name. Reached from ``uninstall_keep_data``, that wipes the earlier
      unconsumed copy before the new one is even made, and returns ``True``.

    Both paths are checked together because both are the same kind of thing (a copy of
    the user's ``data/`` that no live app tree holds) and the caller's decision is the
    same for both: do not proceed, name them, let the user resolve it. Consulting one and
    not the other is how the family got three members.

    and does not try to.

    ``unconsumed`` is the same list :func:`_unconsumed_data_copies` gives the keep-data

    The app is gone from every surface; the data the user made with it is parked at
    ``apps/.{name}.data``, and a later :func:`install` of the same name puts it back.
    Closes the gap in issue #2541: before this, the ladder was "don't remove it"
    (:func:`uninstall`) and "remove everything" (:func:`force_uninstall`), so a user
    who wanted the app gone but their notes kept had no path at all.

    Two pieces of machinery are REUSED rather than reimplemented, because a second
    copy of either is a second thing that can drift:

    * the preserving copy is the one :func:`update` already performs — ``live/data``
      copied out before the tree it lives in is replaced — staged through the same
      quarantine dir install/update stage through;
    * the removal is :func:`force_uninstall` itself, unchanged: its hooks, its
      deregistration, its dependency-ledger accounting, its ``rmtree``.

    FAIL-CLOSED on preservation. If ``data/`` cannot be copied out, NOTHING is
    removed. An operation whose entire promise is "your data survives this" must not
    proceed to the delete having failed to keep that promise.

    And past that point — the removal has happened and the PARK then fails — the staged
    copy is LEFT in quarantine and the audit line names it, because by then it is the
    only copy there is. ``False`` with ``data=park_failed staged_copy=…`` means "the app
    is gone, your data is at that path"; it never means the data is gone (#2574).

    FAIL-CLOSED on an EARLIER copy, too. Both of this rung's own paths can already hold a
    copy of the user's data from a previous run that nothing consumed — a park that failed
    leaves the stage, a restore that failed leaves the park — and every way of proceeding
    over one destroys it. So :func:`_unconsumed_data_copies` is consulted FIRST, before
    anything is copied or removed, and a non-empty answer refuses with
    ``data=unconsumed_copy <paths>`` (#2585). This rung never resolves that itself: the
    "cleanup" for each is a delete in a failure path, which is how #2574 happened.

    Because that refusal comes first, the park below needs no ``rmtree`` of its own
    destination — the destination is provably absent — so it is a single
    :meth:`~pathlib.Path.rename`. Both paths live under ``apps/``, always the same
    filesystem, so that rename is ATOMIC: there is no cross-device ``copytree`` fallback
    to fail halfway and no ``shutil.move`` destination-is-a-directory case to nest the
    stage inside an older park. A parked copy is now complete by CONSTRUCTION, which is
    the guarantee :func:`_restore_preserved_data` relies on when it treats one as
    authoritative — previously that guarantee lived only in the order these two functions
    happened to be called in.
