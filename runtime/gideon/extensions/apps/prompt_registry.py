"""Runtime registry of app-contributed prompt use-cases.

An app/extension can OWN the prompts it uses (declared in its manifest's
``prompts`` list and seeded into the native prompt store on enable). For such a
prompt to be *bindable* and *resolvable*, its use-case must join the core
use-case vocabulary that :mod:`gideon.extensions.providers.prompt_use_cases` exposes.

We can't union from the catalog there: an app's prompts only exist once its
manifest is read, and ``prompt_use_cases`` is on the prompt-resolution hot path
(importing the apps layer from it would be a cycle and a per-call filesystem
scan). So the app-prompt SEEDER registers each app prompt's use-case HERE, and
``prompt_use_cases`` reads this in-process registry and unions it with the core
catalog. The registry is repopulated every startup (the bundled-provider
discovery path + ``enable`` re-seed) and on each ``enable``; ``disable`` removes
the app's entries.

Entries are keyed by use-case. Re-registering the same use-case overwrites (an
app re-enabled, or a manifest changed). Robust when empty — with no apps
installed this contributes nothing and the core catalog stands alone.
