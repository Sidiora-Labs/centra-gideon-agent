"""The NATIVE CAPABILITY CONTRACT (APE-5) — how a bundled app owns its provider code.

A **bundled** (native) app lives at ``gideon/apps/native/<name>/`` and ships inside
the core distribution. Historically every one of them was ``app.json``-only: the manifest's
``provider.implementation`` named a *core* dotted path
(``gideon.engine.tasks.native:create_provider``), so the bundle declared a capability core
implemented. Growing that capability meant editing core — the one thing the app platform
exists to avoid.

This module is the contract that removes that asymmetry:

* A bundled app MAY ship its own Python modules **in its own directory** and point
  ``provider.implementation`` at a bundle-relative module (``provider:create_provider``).
  A module path with no dot is bundle-relative; a dotted one is still a core/package path,
  so the 26 pre-existing bundles are unaffected.
* Those modules are loaded from the bundle dir under a **namespaced** module name
  (:func:`namespaced_module_name`), so two bundles that both ship ``provider.py`` cannot
  collide in ``sys.modules`` — the collision an installed app was already protected from
  and a bundled one was not.
* **Allowed imports = the published SDK, and nothing else.** A bundled app's module may
  import ``gideon.sdk.*``, the standard library, and core's own third-party
  dependencies. It may NOT import any other ``gideon.*`` module. This is the same
  rule ``tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py`` applies to installed apps —
  deliberately the SAME rule, not a second, narrower one: a bundled app is reached
  through the same ``providers/loader.py`` seam, is registered through the same typed
  handler, and is upgraded by the same release, so a separate "native-only" allowlist
  would be a second boundary to keep in step for no gain. What *is* native-specific is
  documented as caveats rather than import bans (see the module list in
  ``docs/architecture/APP_PLATFORM.md``): a bundled module runs IN-PROCESS, so it never
  receives the per-app backend subprocess environment (``sdk.util.shared_app_data_dir``
  is always ``None`` for it), and it cannot declare its own dependencies (the manifest
  ``dependencies`` block installs into an app venv, which a bundled module does not get).

:func:`contract_violations` is the machine-checkable half; ``tests/
test_native_capability_contract.py`` runs it over every bundled module and carries the
vacuity floor (at least one bundle must actually ship a module, or the rail measures
nothing — the failure mode the installed-app rail has, since it silently skips whenever
the workspace ``apps/`` dir is absent).
