"""One masking policy for the sensitive fields of an app/provider settings schema.

A schema property flagged ``x-meta.sensitive: true`` is **write-only**: the operator may
set it and replace it, and the value never travels back out of the process. Two API
surfaces read the very same file — ``~/.gideon/apps/<app>/data/config.json`` — and
must therefore agree:

* ``GET/PUT /api/apps/{name}/config`` (the Apps config UI), and
* ``GET/PATCH /api/providers/{name}/config`` (the Settings → Providers schema form).

They did not. The apps route masked; the providers route — the one the Providers page
actually calls — returned the stored secret verbatim, and echoed it back on save. For the
bundled ``slack-channel`` app that meant a Bot Token and an App Token in every page-load
response body, held in React state, and revealable on screen through the form's eye
toggle. Two implementations of one rule is how that happens, so there is now one:
this module, used by both routes.

The same rule governs a *multi-instance* provider's per-instance config — a
:class:`~gideon.extensions.providers.instances.ExtensionInstance` — through
:func:`mask_instance`. Its ``to_dict()`` is the **persistence** serializer (the instance
store writes that exact dict to disk), so masking cannot live inside it; masking a
credential onto disk would destroy it. :func:`mask_instance` is the *wire* serializer
instead, and every instance route uses it. That distinction is the whole reason the
instance surfaces leaked for as long as they did: the route handed a disk serializer
straight to a response body.

The write half is the other half of the same rule. Once ``GET`` masks, the form PATCHes the
MASK back for any field the operator did not touch, so a PATCH must read the sentinel (and
an empty string where a value already exists) as "keep what is stored" rather than
overwrite a real credential with bullets.

Masking is about not *handing out* secrets; it is not encryption at rest. The store itself
is a plaintext file under the user's home, which the app-platform threat model addresses
separately (``docs/architecture/app-platform.md``).
