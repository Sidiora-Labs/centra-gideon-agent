"""Platform event registry (APE-2) — typed core facts, delivered only to apps that declared them.

APE-1 shipped the DECLARATION half: ``permissions.eventSubscriptions``, a list of exact
platform-event names an app asks to receive, disclosed at install consent. It deliberately
added no accessor and no delivery, on the reasoning that an enforcement point with no call
site enforces nothing. This module is the runtime that honours the declaration.

**Three registered events, each registered AT its emit site** (no second bus beside the
existing ones — the emit points are the places the fact already becomes true):

* ``session.created``    — ``dashboard/state.get_or_create_session``, where a new session
  row is inserted into ``_sessions``.
* ``knowledge.ingested`` — ``knowledge/pipeline/runner.ingest_item``, at the same terminal
  point the SSE ``ingest_complete`` fires from, so the app-facing fact and the UI-facing
  one can never disagree.
* ``task.completed``     — ``tasks/native.NativeTaskProvider.update_task``, on the same
  edge-triggered completion boundary (``pool.should_fire_completion``) the ``TaskComplete``
  user hook fires on. One edge, two observers.

**Two axes, kept apart (the contract APE-1 pinned).** ``eventSubscriptions`` is NOT
``permissions.events``. ``events`` is the gateway's WebSocket event-type allowlist, gated by
``can_use_event`` and enforced in ``state.broadcast_ws``; a platform subscription must not
grant the WS type of the same name, or the registry would inherit a second, wider path to
the same data (``test_event_subscriptions_do_not_widen_the_ws_event_allowlist``). Delivery
here therefore does **not** touch the WS fan-out at all: it goes through the broker-owned
per-app inbox (below), gated by its own accessor
``PermissionChecker.can_receive_platform_event``.

**Transport: the existing broker inbox, not a new one.** A delivered event is appended to
the app's broker-owned queue under ``config_dir()/app_messages/<app>.json`` — the same
queue ``apps/messaging.py`` owns and the app already drains, read-once, through
``GET /api/apps/message`` (scoped to the reader's own verified app identity). Reusing it
buys the depth cap, the atomic write, the read-once semantics and a live consumer for free.
Platform events are distinguishable from app-to-app messages by their sender:
:data:`PLATFORM_SENDER` is ``"@platform"``, which ``manager._validate_app_name`` rejects, so
no installed app can ever forge a message that reads as one. The two GRANTS stay separate:
``appMessaging`` governs app→app, ``eventSubscriptions`` governs platform→app, and holding
one grants nothing about the other.

**Deny by default, exact match.** ``emit`` fans out only to apps that are installed,
ENABLED, and name the event exactly. There is no prefix and no ``*`` wildcard (mirroring
``desktop``, unlike ``api``/``events``), so a subscription to ``task.completed`` never
matches ``task.completed.extra`` or ``task.*`` — a typo denies rather than widens. An app
that declares nothing receives nothing.

**Payloads carry identifiers, never prose.** Each event's payload keys are pinned in the
registry and an undeclared key is refused. That is a security rule, not tidiness: if an
event carried a task title or an item's text, a subscribed app with no matching
``permissions.api`` grant would receive content it cannot otherwise read, and the
subscription would silently widen ``can_use_api``. Keeping payloads to ids/statuses means a
subscription grants TIMING, not CONTENT — the app still has to fetch details through its own
granted API scope. ``session.created`` carries the session's name because the name IS its
address in this codebase; that is exactly what install consent discloses ("Receive platform
events: session.created"), and string values are length-capped. An app that feeds a payload
value to a model should fence it itself (``gideon.sdk.security``); nothing here is
free text the platform generated on an app's behalf, so there is no fence to apply on its
behalf either.

**Audit posture (deliberate).** Ordinary fan-out writes NO security event, in either
direction. An app never *requests* a platform event — dispatch is host-initiated, so a
non-delivery is not an access attempt, and one SEL row per (installed app × emitted event)
would flood the HMAC chain and drown the real rows. What IS audited is bounded and
anomalous: an emit naming an UNREGISTERED event (``outcome="rejected"`` — a code defect that
would otherwise vanish) and a delivery that FAILED for an app that had earned it
(``outcome="error"`` — a subscribed app silently missing an event it declared).
