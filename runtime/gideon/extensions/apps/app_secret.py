"""Per-app proxy secret — mint + read the HMAC key that authenticates the proxy.

An app backend binds on loopback with no inbound auth of its own (see
``docs/architecture/app-platform.md`` §2.1): the port is a *network* boundary, not
an *authorization* one. To make the permission model hold, every request the gateway
reverse-proxy forwards is signed with an HMAC over a per-app secret, and the backend's
SDK middleware refuses anything unsigned (fail-closed). This module owns that secret's
one true storage shape so the two call sites agree:

- :func:`ensure_app_secret` — used by the backend supervisor at ``start()`` to mint
  (once) and read the secret, then inject it into the child env as
  ``GIDEON_APP_SECRET``. Fail-closed: returns ``None`` if the secret cannot be
  written/read, so the supervisor declines to start an unprotected backend.
- :func:`read_app_secret` — used by the proxy handler at forward time to sign. The
  supervisor already minted it; the proxy just reads (returns ``None`` if absent →
  the proxy fails closed rather than forwarding unsigned).

Kept in its own module (not inline in ``backend_runtime`` or the handler) precisely
because two independent call sites need identical path + 0600 discipline; a single
auditable home is safer than duplicating the crypto-adjacent bits.

The secret is a 256-bit hex token (``secrets.token_hex(32)``). The file is 0600 and its
value is NEVER logged.
