"""The child half of provider availability — see :mod:`gideon.extensions.providers.availability`.

Runs as ``python -m gideon.extensions.providers.availability_probe <app>…`` in its own process, never inside the
gateway. For every provider record of every named app it resolves the app's
``availability()`` hook exactly as the extension loader does
(:func:`gideon.extensions.providers.loader.load_availability`), and writes one JSON line per record
to stdout the moment that record's answer exists. Every hook runs on its own thread, so a slow
hook delays only its own line and the gateway keeps every answer that landed before it gave up.

stdout is the protocol channel and nothing else. App code that prints — a hook with a debug
``print``, a library announcing itself on import — goes to stderr, because ``sys.stdout`` is
repointed there before any app module is imported.

Read-only by construction: the apps are discovered into a PRIVATE registry with no type
handlers, so registering one enables nothing, and nothing here seeds, installs or writes.
