"""``--seed-local-model`` — bind a local Ollama provider into ``$GIDEON_HOME``.

Why this is a step BESIDE the fixture rather than content INSIDE it: ``seed()`` is a
bare ``shutil.copytree`` of a checked-in tree (see :mod:`gideon.seed`), so
everything it writes is byte-identical on every machine. A model binding is not
machine-independent — it names an endpoint that may or may not be listening and a
model that may or may not be pulled. Baking one operator's endpoint into the fixture
would ship a demo home that cannot serve a turn anywhere else, and the copy has no
hook where a probe could run. So the fixture stays machine-independent and this
module does the machine-dependent half, conditionally.

The whole point is that it DEGRADES rather than half-populates. Nothing is written
unless every precondition holds:

* the endpoint answers Ollama's ``/api/tags``,
* that answer contains a model to bind,
* the ``ollama-models`` provider app is installed in the home (or installable from a
  local app source).

If any of those is missing the home is left exactly as the fixture wrote it and the
reason is printed. A demo seed that errors, hangs, or writes a ``providers[]`` entry
no installed app can build is worse than one that populates nothing, because the
operator then has to diagnose a broken home instead of reading one line of output.

No credential is involved anywhere. A local Ollama needs none, which is why it is the
right provider for a committed demo path — do not extend this to a cloud provider,
which would.
