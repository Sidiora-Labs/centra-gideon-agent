"""First-run onboarding progress state (ONBOARDING-UX C1).

**What this holds.** The resume point of the guided first-run flow, which essential
apps the user set up, and which "try one" first-success cards they completed:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "step": "name",
      "essentials": {"model": null, "search": false, "speech": false, "channel": null},
      "first_success": {"knowledge": false, "trigger": false, "loop": false}
    }

**Why it is entity state, not config.** This is per-user progress through a flow, not a
tunable — so it lives in ``entity_settings/onboarding.json`` and is written by a dedicated
``POST /api/onboarding/state``, never through the ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` PATCH allowlist
(the §2.1 entity-state rule). It rides the existing ``entity_settings`` inventory entry
(``KIND_JSON_ENTITY_DIR``), so snapshot/restore and durability sync already cover it —
exactly like ``feedback.json``, ``channel_trust.json`` and ``legibility.json``.

**Tolerant reads are the contract.** :func:`load_onboarding_state` never raises: a missing
file, a corrupt file, a file written by an older client that has none of these fields, or a
field carrying the wrong type all resolve to the default for that field. The flow degrades
to "start at the beginning", never to a 500.

**Strict writes are the contract.** :func:`merge_onboarding_state` rejects an unknown or
mistyped key with :class:`ValueError` rather than dropping it silently. Bug #22 (the
entity-settings PUT that blind-merged any body key) taught the repo that a lenient write
path leaks garbage back out through every read; for a brand-new endpoint an explicit 400
also means a frontend typo surfaces immediately instead of becoming a silent no-op.

**Naming deviation from C1, recorded.** C1 spelled the middle step ``provider`` and the
field ``provider_chosen``. The 2026-07-26 amendment (ruling a) re-scoped that step from
"pick a provider" to "install the essential apps" and generalized the field to
``essentials``; this module names the *step* ``essentials`` too, so the step id and the
field it fills agree. C1 also annotated ``name``/``completed`` as "existing" fields of this
state — they are not: the name lives in server identity and ``onboarded`` is derived from
it being non-empty (``web/src/app/identity.tsx``). Storing either here would create a
second source of truth, so neither is part of this schema.
