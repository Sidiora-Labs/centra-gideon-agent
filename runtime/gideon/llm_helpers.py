    Resolves the provider through the same use-case bridge the chat path uses —
    which reads the active model selection from ``active_models.json`` (Settings →
    Models) — then builds a temporary instance, streams the response, and returns
    the collected text. The resolved provider is wrapped in the model-call guard
    (circuit breaker + hard timeout + attempt audit) at the bridge seam.

    ``use_case`` names a chat sub-category axis (MODEL-USE-CASES-V2):
    ``"background"`` IS a real axis now (titles/tags/suggestions/digests/
    consolidation route through it, falling back to the active ``chat`` chain when
    unbound), as are ``"reasoning"``, ``"loops"``, and ``"orchestration"``. The
    remaining informal label ``"ingestion"`` collapses to ``"background"``; anything
    unrecognized collapses to ``"reasoning"``. ``chat``/``code_tools`` are never
    used here — they route a native agent through the in-process agent runtime,
    but a one-shot completion wants a plain model provider.

    On a chain with fallbacks, a ``CircuitOpenError``/provider failure from entry N
    advances to entry N+1 for this call (bounded by chain length) — the
    call-failure walk that complements the seam's resolution-time breaker skip.

    ``output_type`` (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §2.4) opts into typed structured output:
    pass ``dict`` or ``list`` to require the response parse as that JSON shape.
    On a parse miss the call is retried ONCE with a targeted correction note
    injected (the dominant real-world cause is the schema not being visible), and
    if it still fails an :class:`~gideon.guardrails.failure.OutputContractError`
    is raised — replacing the silent ``None`` degrade that ``parse_llm_json``
    returned at every call site. Returns the raw text unchanged when ``output_type``
    is ``None`` (the response is still a ``str``; typed callers parse the returned
    text, e.g. via ``json.loads``).

    ``model`` PINS resolution to one concrete model (a ``"Provider:model_id"`` ref,
    or a bare id), bypassing the use case's active-selection CHAIN — a pin is not a
    chain. This is the seam cross-model judge isolation needs (WF2LOO-11): the engine
    resolves a different-FAMILY judge model up front, validates it against the
    producing stage's model, and pins it here so the judge provably runs on the model
    it was checked against. The default ``""`` keeps today's use-case-only resolution
    byte-for-byte.
