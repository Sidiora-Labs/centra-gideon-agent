    """Does the provider behind ``model_ref`` enforce a supplied JSON Schema NATIVELY?

    The gate on forwarding ``output_type`` as a build kwarg (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §2.4,
    AG-9). It asks a narrow question about ONE entry and answers ``False`` to every
    doubt, because a false positive here does not degrade to a weaker constraint — it
    corrupts the request. Build kwargs land in the provider's ``extra_options``, and both
    wire clients copy that bag onto the request body (``llm/openai.py`` assigns
    unconditionally, ``llm/anthropic.py`` ``setdefault``s). A provider that does not POP
    ``output_type`` therefore hands a Python ``type`` to the JSON encoder and dies with an
    opaque ``TypeError`` from the HTTP client — a call that works today would start
    failing. So only a provider that ADVERTISED the capability is sent the key; the ollama
    app pops it (``resolve_output_format``) and normalizes it into ollama's own ``format``.

    ``JSON_SCHEMA`` ONLY. ``JSON_MODE`` is deliberately excluded, and the comparison below
    names the grade rather than spelling it ``!= NONE`` so the code states that decision.
    A ``JSON_MODE`` provider speaks OpenAI-wire ``response_format={"type":
    "json_object"}`` — a DIFFERENT request field that no adapter derives from
    ``output_type``, so the key would ride through unconsumed (the corruption above)
    instead of being translated. It also cannot express ``output_type=list`` at all
    (``json_object`` mode requires an object), so for half of this function's real inputs
    the weaker grade is not weaker, it is wrong. Reaching ``JSON_MODE`` is genuine work —
    its own ``response_format`` build kwarg plus an adapter that consumes it — not a
    loosened comparison here.

    Contrast ``workflows/grounding.py``, which asks ``!= NONE``: that answers a different
    question — "does schema-constrained emission exist ANYWHERE in this install" — for
    which ``JSON_MODE`` legitimately counts.

    The comparison is ``==`` rather than ``is`` because :class:`StructuredOutput` is a
    ``str`` enum: that accepts both the enum member and its own ``"json_schema"`` spelling
    (an app declaring the grade as a bare string still gets its capability honoured) and
    nothing else — no other grade or value compares equal, so the acceptance set widens
    without admitting a false positive.

    Everything unverifiable degrades to ``False``: an unqualified ref (a bare model id,
    including the ``"gpt-oss:20b"`` shape whose colon is not a provider prefix — the
    ``get_entry`` lookup rejects it exactly as the bridge does), the legacy
    ``"Provider/model"`` slash spelling, an unregistered provider type, an unbootstrapped
    registry, or ``""`` (the unbound-axis plain path, where the implicit fallback has not
    picked a provider yet). In every one of those cases core sends no constraint and the
    universal parse-with-targeted-retry net in ``_run`` owns the contract — byte-for-byte
    today's behaviour.

    Resolves the provider through the same use-case bridge the chat path uses —
    which reads the active model selection from ``active_models.json`` (Settings →
    Models) — then builds a temporary instance, streams the response, and returns
    the collected text. The resolved provider is wrapped in the model-call guard
    (circuit breaker + hard timeout + attempt audit) at the bridge seam.

    ``use_case`` names a chat sub-category axis (MODEL-USE-CASES-V2):
    ``"background"`` IS a real axis now (titles/tags/suggestions/digests/
    consolidation route through it, falling back to the active ``chat`` chain when
    unbound), as are ``"reasoning"``, ``"loops"``, and ``"orchestration"``. The
    remaining informal label ``"ingestion"`` collapses to ``"background"``; anything
    unrecognized collapses to ``"reasoning"``. ``chat``/``code_tools`` are never
    used here — they route a native agent through the in-process agent runtime,
    but a one-shot completion wants a plain model provider.

    On a chain with fallbacks, a ``CircuitOpenError``/provider failure from entry N
    advances to entry N+1 for this call (bounded by chain length) — the
    call-failure walk that complements the seam's resolution-time breaker skip.

    ``output_type`` (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §2.4) opts into typed structured output:
    pass ``dict`` or ``list`` to require the response parse as that JSON shape.
    On a parse miss the call is retried ONCE with a targeted correction note
    injected (the dominant real-world cause is the schema not being visible), and
    if it still fails an :class:`~gideon.guardrails.failure.OutputContractError`
    is raised — replacing the silent ``None`` degrade that ``parse_llm_json``
    returned at every call site. Returns the raw text unchanged when ``output_type``
    is ``None`` (the response is still a ``str``; typed callers parse the returned
    text, e.g. via ``json.loads``).

    ``output_type`` ALSO rides the bridge as a build kwarg (AG-9) — but only to an entry
    whose provider advertised ``StructuredOutput.JSON_SCHEMA``, so a natively capable
    provider CONSTRAINS generation instead of merely being asked nicely in prose. The
    ollama app is the first consumer: it pops the key and normalizes ``dict``/``list``
    into ollama's own ``format=<schema>``. The gate is per ENTRY, not per call, because a
    chain can advance from a capable model to an incapable one mid-call; a provider that
    never advertised the capability is sent NOTHING, because build kwargs reach the
    request body and an unconsumed key there is a corrupt request, not a soft no-op.
    ``JSON_MODE`` is deliberately excluded — see :func:`_enforces_json_schema_natively`.
    The native constraint LAYERS with the parse-and-retry above rather than replacing it:
    constrained decoding can still return a valid-but-empty document, so dropping the
    parse would turn a caught failure into a silent one.

    ``model`` PINS resolution to one concrete model (a ``"Provider:model_id"`` ref,
    or a bare id), bypassing the use case's active-selection CHAIN — a pin is not a
    chain. This is the seam cross-model judge isolation needs (WF2LOO-11): the engine
    resolves a different-FAMILY judge model up front, validates it against the
    producing stage's model, and pins it here so the judge provably runs on the model
    it was checked against. The default ``""`` keeps today's use-case-only resolution
    byte-for-byte.

    ``temperature`` pins the SAMPLING temperature for this one call (HARNESS-CRAFT
    §2.1): it rides the bridge as a build kwarg into the provider's ``extra_options``,
    where both protocol clients already forward call params into the request. This is
    what makes best-of-N sampling genuinely varied rather than N identical calls. Two
    honest caveats: an Anthropic model in extended-thinking mode forbids a custom
    temperature and drops it (``llm/anthropic.py``), and a provider that ignores the
    parameter simply returns its default — a temperature is a request, not a promise.
    ``None`` (the default) sends nothing, keeping every existing call site unchanged.

    The per-call OUTPUT BUDGET (LMMV §2.2) is derived, never hardcoded: every resolution
    path (pin / chain-advance / plain) asks
    :func:`gideon.local_models.budgets.output_budget` for the model it is about to
    run and rides the answer as a ``max_tokens`` build kwarg. A local model whose card
    declares ``context_tokens``/``output_tokens`` therefore gets ITS window instead of the
    hosted-model table's 200k default and the adapters' hardcoded 4096; a model the
    catalog does not know falls back to that table and, only then, to 4096 — the same
    number as before, now named once in ``local_models/budgets.py``. Because the bridge
    merges build kwargs with ``setdefault``, an operator's configured ``max_tokens`` still
    wins. No compaction logic is involved: this makes the number available, it does not
    decide what to drop.

        ``output_tokens`` (LMMV §2.2) via ``local_models.budgets``, which falls back to
        the shared hosted-model window table and, only when that too is silent, to the
        4096 the adapters used to hardcode. Riding it as a build kwarg means it reaches
        the provider through the same seam ``temperature`` uses — and because the bridge
        merges build kwargs with ``setdefault``, an operator's explicitly configured
        ``max_tokens`` still wins over the derived one.

        Fail-soft: an unresolvable budget must not be the thing that stops a completion,
        so the call site degrades to "pass nothing" (the adapter default) rather than
        raising.

        ``output_type`` rides here too (AG-9), and ONLY when this entry's provider
        advertised ``StructuredOutput.JSON_SCHEMA`` — see
        :func:`_enforces_json_schema_natively` for why an unadvertised provider must not
        receive the key. PER ENTRY is the whole point of deciding here rather than once
        up front: every resolution path (pin / chain advance / plain) funnels through this
        function WITH the ref it is about to run, and the chain walk below can advance
        from a capable entry to an incapable one mid-call. A decision made once would send
        the constraint to a fallback provider that cannot honour it — precisely the
        corrupt-request failure the capability gate exists to prevent.

        The constraint is a REQUEST, never a promise, so it does not replace anything: the
        parse-with-targeted-retry net in ``_run`` still checks every response. Constrained
        decoding is measured in this repo to return valid-but-empty documents, so dropping
        the parse because "the provider guarantees it" would convert a caught failure into
        a silent one. Both layers stay.

        ``output_type=None`` (the overwhelmingly common case) short-circuits before the
        capability lookup, so the kwargs are byte-for-byte what they were and no registry
        work happens on that path.
