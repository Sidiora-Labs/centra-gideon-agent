"""App Platform lifecycle — install / enable / disable / uninstall (A1).

The runtime is Gideon-native, built on top of
the existing manifest (:mod:`apps.manifest`) + storage primitives
(:mod:`apps.manager`). Turns "read what's present" into a real, safety-gated
lifecycle:

* **install(source)** — copy → **stage in quarantine** → validate manifest →
  **scan staged content** (the shared :class:`SkillScanner` gate; ``dangerous``
  is terminal, non-overridable) → require consent for risky verdicts → run
  ``setup.onInstall`` (bounded subprocess) → register providers → write
  ``installed.json``.
* **enable / disable(name)** — run ``setup.onEnable``/``onDisable`` (bounded),
  flip the provider registration.

Removal is a THREE-rung ladder, and each rung is a different promise about the
user's ``data/`` — the notes they wrote, a campaign's ledger, an incident log:

* **uninstall(name)** — DEACTIVATE. Nothing leaves disk; the app is turned off.
* **uninstall_keep_data(name)** — the app's files go, ``data/`` is KEPT (parked at
  ``apps/.{name}.data``) and a later ``install`` of the same name puts it back.
* **force_uninstall(name)** — everything goes, ``data/`` included.

The middle rung exists because the first two alone force a choice between leaving a
dead app installed forever and destroying the user's data (issue #2541).

Every lifecycle action is SEL-audited. Executing a third-party ``setup`` hook is
RCE-by-design, so a hook only runs after the scanner passes (or the caller gives
explicit consent for a ``warning``) — never on a ``dangerous`` verdict, and never
auto-forced for an unattended/agent-initiated install.

Atomic update + rollback is A2; the dependency ledger is A3; this is the core.
