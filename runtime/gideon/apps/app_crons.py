"""App-declared cron reconciliation (untrusted-app sandbox P3).

An app manifest may declare ``crons: list[CronEntry]`` — scheduled agent jobs the
app wants run on a cadence. These are only honored when the app declares the
``cron`` permission (``can_use_cron``); without it the declaration is inert.

Rather than couple app_manager to the scheduler, the gateway calls
:func:`reconcile_app_crons` once at startup (after apps are loaded). Reconciliation is
idempotent + declarative: every app-owned trigger is tagged ``created_by="app:<name>"``, so we can
diff the desired set (enabled apps × their permitted manifest crons) against the registered
``app:*`` triggers and add / prune to match. This covers enable, disable, uninstall, permission
changes, and manifest edits without per-lifecycle wiring — the next start reconciles.

Trigger id/name convention: ``app:<app-name>:<cron-name>``.

**🔴 S108 — this wrote to `crons.json`, so app crons DID NOT FIRE.** The clock engine
(`triggers.service.tick`) reads the unified store and nothing else, and the boot migration that
imports `crons.json` runs BEFORE reconciliation. Measured: a job written here landed in `crons.json`
with `triggers.json` empty, so an app's declared cron stayed inert until the NEXT gateway boot
imported it — every app cron was one restart behind its own manifest, and a freshly installed app's
cron never ran on the session that installed it. Reconciliation now writes the store directly.

The rows are built as `Trigger` objects rather than through `tools.create`, deliberately: this
reconciler's whole mechanism is a diff against a DETERMINISTIC id (``app:<app>:<cron>``), and
`tools.create` mints its own slug-derived unique id. Going through it would leave every restart
unable to recognize its own previous rows, so the diff would add duplicates forever instead of
converging.
