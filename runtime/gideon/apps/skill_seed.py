"""App-owned skill seeding — an app ships and OWNS SKILL.md skills (§4.1).

An app declares the skill DIRECTORIES it ships in its manifest's ``skills`` list
(``{path: "skills/my-skill/"}``, dir paths relative to the app dir, each holding a
``SKILL.md``). This mirrors :mod:`gideon.apps.prompt_seed` for prompts, with
one hard rule the prompt path doesn't need: **a skill never bypasses the
supply-chain gate just because it arrived inside an app.**

On ``enable`` (and the always-on bundled-discovery path at startup),
:func:`seed_app_skills` installs each declared skill dir into the user skills tree
THROUGH the shared chokepoint (:func:`gideon.skills.marketplace.install_scanned`
→ quarantine → ``scan_dir`` at the app's trust tier → ``.pclaw-lock.json`` with
per-file sha256 + SEL audit — DANGEROUS refuses always). Idempotent +
non-clobbering: a skill dir of the same name that already exists (possibly a
user's own, possibly a prior seed) is left untouched, exactly the prompt-seed
contract. On ``/update`` the old app's skills are removed pre-swap and the new
ones re-seeded post-swap, so a changed skill re-passes the scan.

On ``disable``/uninstall, :func:`remove_app_skills` removes ONLY the skills this
app shipped — keyed by the ``.pclaw-lock.json`` provenance (``source ==
app:<name>``), never a user's own skill (no lock, or a different source).
