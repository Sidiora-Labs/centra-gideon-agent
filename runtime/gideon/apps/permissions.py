"""App permission enforcement (A5) — make declared ``Permissions`` real.

An app's manifest declares a permission scope (``permissions``: api / events /
mcpTools / storage / network / memory / cron). Until now that was declarative
only. This module turns it into an enforced boundary, server-side — the
defense-in-depth half of the plan (the SDK enforces client-side too in A6, but a
client check is bypassable, so the gateway must reject independently).

Identity: a request carrying an app-scoped token has ``request["app"]`` set to
the app name (minted in :mod:`token_auth`). When that's present, the app
enforcement middleware checks the request path against the app's
``permissions.api`` allowlist — an undeclared path is rejected ``403`` before the
handler runs. A request with no app identity (the owner/dashboard) is unaffected.

The checker is the seam every capability enforcement consults (untrusted-app
sandbox). Enforcement status of each method:

* ``can_use_api``   — app-permission middleware (server.py), 403 on undeclared path.
* ``can_use_agent`` — the app agent-run endpoints (handlers/apps.py), checked
  against the CALLING app's identity rather than the ``{name}`` path segment, plus
  a per-run ownership check so an app only reads runs it spawned.
* ``can_use_event`` — WS fan-out (state.broadcast_ws) filters an app connection's
  events to its declared set.
* ``can_receive_platform_event`` — the platform event registry (``apps/app_events.emit``)
  fans a core fact out ONLY to apps that named it exactly, and that dispatch is the only
  path such an event reaches an app by, so this is the whole gate. A SEPARATE axis from
  ``can_use_event`` above: a WS grant is not a platform subscription and vice versa.
* ``can_use_mcp_tool`` — the direct tool-invoke endpoint (handlers/tools.py).
* ``can_use_memory`` — app-permission middleware gates any ``/api/memory`` path.
* ``can_use_cron``  — app-declared manifest crons are registered only when held
  (apps/app_crons.reconcile_app_crons).
* ``can_use_storage`` — the backend launcher hands the app its DATA_DIR only when
  held (apps/backend_runtime).
* ``can_use_app_messaging`` — the gateway broker (apps/messaging.send_message) refuses
  an undeclared sender→target pair 403 + SEL, and it is the only app-to-app path, so
  this is the whole gate. Enforced, and (APE-12) disclosed at install consent as such.
* ``can_use_desktop`` — the desktop seam (``handlers/desktop.py``) refuses an app
  identity that did not declare the capability, 403 + SEL ``desktop.capability_denied``.
  Apps have no other path to the shell (Electron IPC is renderer-only and the
  gateway mediates every call), so this is the whole gate. Enforced, and disclosed
  at install consent among the enforced bullets.
* ``can_use_network`` — **DECLARATION-ONLY (unenforced by design)**, and the consent
  surface says so rather than implying otherwise (EI-12 D2). There is no per-app
  egress chokepoint to enforce at: an app's provider code is imported **in-process**
  by the gateway (``providers/loader.py``), so its own ``httpx``/``requests`` calls
  are the gateway's egress, and an app with a backend owns a separate OS process with
  its own network stack. Confining either would take an OS-level isolation layer
  (cgroups/nftables/seccomp) or routing all app egress through a guarded seam — an
  architecture change, not a flag. So the flag is DISCLOSURE, and the Store discloses
  it as such: ``PermissionList`` (``web/src/pages/apps/AppsSection.tsx``) renders the
  network claim OUTSIDE the enforced-permission bullets, labelled advisory, and
  renders it whether or not the app declares it — so neither its presence nor its
  absence reads as containment. Every gateway-MEDIATED reach is separately bounded by
  ``can_use_api``. Treat ``network: true`` as an honest declaration, not a boundary.

    """Why an app-scoped request must be refused, or ``""`` to allow it.

    **The one authorization decision for a request carrying an app identity**, so the
    gateway middleware and its tests exercise the same code. It previously lived inline
    in ``server.py``'s ``app_permission_middleware`` closure, which cannot be imported —
    so the two test files that cover it each re-implemented it as a mirror, and a mirror
    is free to drift from the boundary it claims to test.

    🔴 FAILS CLOSED, which is the fix. Every check inline was written as
    ``if checker is not None and not checker.can_use_...``, so an app whose manifest
    could not be resolved skipped ALL of them and reached any path at all. Measured
    against the shipped predicate, an app-scoped token for a name with no readable
    manifest was allowed ``/api/apps/<other>/agent-run``, ``/api/memory/all`` AND
    ``/api/security/credentials`` — strictly more reach than the app's own declared
    allowlist. Two ordinary situations produce it:

    * **The owner uninstalls the app.** The directory goes, so ``_manifest_of`` returns
      ``None``. App tokens live an hour (``_APP_TOKEN_TTL_SECS``) and carry the claim in
      the token itself, so there is nothing to revoke — meaning the owner's remediation
      handed a misbehaving app MORE access than it had before, for up to an hour.
    * **The manifest stops parsing.** An app that can write its own install directory
      escapes its sandbox by corrupting its own ``app.json``.

    Disabling had the mirror-image problem: ``_manifest_of`` reads ``app.json`` from
    disk and never consults ``installed.json``, so a disabled app's checker granted
    everything it always had. Minting a token already refuses a disabled app
    (``api_app_token``), which only covers tokens minted AFTER the flip — the live one
    kept working. Checking per request is what makes "disable" mean disable now.

    Ordering is deliberate: lifecycle (installed → enabled → readable) before capability,
    so the reason names the actual problem rather than "path not declared" for an app
    that is simply gone.
