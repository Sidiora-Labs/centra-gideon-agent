"""App permission enforcement (A5) — make declared ``Permissions`` real.

An app's manifest declares a permission scope (``permissions``: api / events /
mcpTools / storage / network / memory / cron). Until now that was declarative
only. This module turns it into an enforced boundary, server-side — the
defense-in-depth half of the plan (the SDK enforces client-side too in A6, but a
client check is bypassable, so the gateway must reject independently).

Identity: a request carrying an app-scoped token has ``request["app"]`` set to
the app name (minted in :mod:`token_auth`). When that's present, the app
enforcement middleware checks the request path against the app's
``permissions.api`` allowlist — an undeclared path is rejected ``403`` before the
handler runs. A request with no app identity (the owner/dashboard) is unaffected.

The checker is the seam every capability enforcement consults (untrusted-app
sandbox). Enforcement status of each method:

* ``can_use_api``   — app-permission middleware (server.py), 403 on undeclared path.
* ``can_use_agent`` — the app agent-run endpoints (handlers/apps.py), checked
  against the CALLING app's identity rather than the ``{name}`` path segment, plus
  a per-run ownership check so an app only reads runs it spawned.
* ``can_use_event`` — WS fan-out (state.broadcast_ws) filters an app connection's
  events to its declared set.
* ``can_use_mcp_tool`` — the direct tool-invoke endpoint (handlers/tools.py).
* ``can_use_memory`` — app-permission middleware gates any ``/api/memory`` path.
* ``can_use_cron``  — app-declared manifest crons are registered only when held
  (apps/app_crons.reconcile_app_crons).
* ``can_use_storage`` — the backend launcher hands the app its DATA_DIR only when
  held (apps/backend_runtime).
* ``can_use_network`` — **DECLARATION-ONLY (unenforced by design)**. An app
  backend is an isolated subprocess with its own OS-level network stack; there is
  no in-process egress hook the gateway can intercept. The flag records INTENT so
  the Store can surface it (install consent lists "network access: yes/no") and a
  future OS-level isolation layer (cgroups/nftables/seccomp) can enforce it. Every
  gateway-MEDIATED reach is already bounded by ``can_use_api`` — a ``network:false``
  app can still reach the internet through its own subprocess; the plan is to
  tighten this via egress sandboxing in a future milestone. Until then, treat
  ``network: true`` as an honest declaration, not a security boundary.
