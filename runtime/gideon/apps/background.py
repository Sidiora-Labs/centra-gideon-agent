"""The contract an app's supervised background worker implements (APE-3, contract half).

An app may declare the ``backgroundTasks`` permission (``apps/manifest.py``) to register a
long-lived worker — richer than ``cron``, which is N discrete agent runs on a clock. Until
this module existed the permission granted nothing because, as ``manifest.py`` says of it,
"whose host still does not exist". This is the half of that host an app **writes against**:
the worker shape, the cooperative control protocol, and the env handshake the child reads.
Supervision (spawn, watchdog restart, PPID reaping, budget accounting) is the parent-side
half and lives in the runtime, not here.

Process model — deliberately the same shape as an app **backend**
================================================================
``backend_runtime._launch_cmd`` starts a child as ``[sys.executable, <entry script>]`` — a
*script path*, not an imported symbol — and hands the child its whole context through
**environment variables** ("so it never guesses a path relative to ``__file__``"). A worker
follows that convention exactly rather than inventing a second one: the app ships an entry
script, and the script's ``__main__`` block hands its worker object to :func:`run_worker`::

    # apps/my-app/worker.py
    from gideon.sdk.background import BackgroundWorker, run_worker

    class Poller(BackgroundWorker):
        poll_interval = 60.0

        def run_once(self, ctx):
            (ctx.data_dir / "last-run").write_text(str(time.time()))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        run_worker(Poller())

So the worker is **a unit-of-work object driven by a loop the SDK owns**, not a bare
``async def run()`` the host awaits and not a free-form script that owns its own ``while
True``. The choice is forced by the two done-when clauses: a host that must be able to STOP
and to PAUSE a worker needs a point in time where the worker is between units of work and
the control state can be consulted. ``run_once`` *is* that point. A worker that owned its
own loop would have to be trusted to poll — see "an uncooperative worker" below.

Stop and pause are DIFFERENT states, not one flag
=================================================
* **stop** is terminal. The app was disabled or uninstalled, or the gateway is shutting
  down. The worker finishes the unit of work it is in, the driver returns, the process
  exits. :meth:`WorkerControl.resume` deliberately cannot undo it.
* **pause** is resumable. The app breached a budget (or an operator paused it, or the host
  is degraded). No new unit of work starts, the process stays alive, and a later
  :meth:`WorkerControl.resume` continues where it left off.

Collapsing the two into one boolean is the failure this module exists to prevent: a paused
worker that reports itself stopped is a worker the host will not resume, and a stopping
worker that reports itself paused is an orphan.

An uncooperative worker
=======================
Cooperation is how a worker keeps its in-flight unit of work; it is **not** what makes the
host correct. A worker that never calls :meth:`WorkerControl.should_stop` still yields
control at the end of each ``run_once`` because the *driver*, not the worker, owns the loop
condition. A worker whose ``run_once`` never returns at all is escalated by the parent-side
supervisor on the existing precedent for app backends — SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after
``backend_runtime._TERM_TIMEOUT`` (5 seconds). It loses whatever it was mid-way through,
which is exactly the cost the cooperative path buys off.

The permission handshake
========================
This module invents **no** permission surface. ``backgroundTasks`` (declared at install,
consented in the Store) stays the only gate, and it is checked **parent-side**, by the
host, before a child is ever spawned. What the child does is *fail closed on the absence of
evidence that the check happened*: the host sets :data:`WORKER_GRANT_ENV` to the exact
permission name it verified, and :meth:`WorkerContext.from_env` refuses to build a context
without it. So ``python worker.py`` by hand, or an app backend trying to self-start a second
worker, raises :class:`WorkerContractError` instead of quietly running unsupervised work.

That handshake is a *contract* check, not a sandbox: an env var is forgeable by the app
itself, and an app that spawns its own process was always able to. Confinement remains the
sandbox's job (``sandbox.build_child_env`` / ``spawn_shim_argv``, as for a backend). What
the handshake actually guarantees is that no worker runs *believing it is supervised* when
it is not.

Import closure: stdlib only, on purpose. A contract an app imports must not drag the host
in — nothing here imports the gateway, the dashboard, or ``backend_runtime``.
