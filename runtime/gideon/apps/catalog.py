"""App catalog — what's AVAILABLE to install, for the Store half of the App page.

The App page has two halves:
  * **Library** — what's installed (``apps.manager.list_apps``).
  * **Store** — what's available to install, which this module enumerates from two
    sources:
      1. **Native** — manifests Gideon ships under ``apps/native/`` (native)
         that aren't currently installed (e.g. a default provider the user
         force-uninstalled, or a bundled app they haven't added yet).
      2. **Git sources** — a user-managed list of git URLs (seeded with any
         Gideon-bundled defaults). Each entry is an installable app source;
         the catalog reports it as available without cloning (the clone happens at
         install time, behind the scanner gate).

A catalog entry is metadata only — installing one routes through the normal
``app_manager.install`` (path for bundled, git URL for sources), so the scanner
gate + lifecycle are unchanged.

# folded into every read of :func:`list_git_sources`, so a bundled default cannot be removed
# (the next read puts it back) — which is exactly why the docstring above says "not
# user-removable". The registry has to be REMOVABLE, so instead of being folded in on read it
# is written ONCE into ``app-sources.json`` as an ordinary row (:func:`seed_default_git_sources`,

# on it is a normal user entry: the existing DELETE removes it, and the marker — which survives
# the removal — is what stops the next start from seeding it again.

    The rule distinguishes a USERNAME from a SECRET, because `ssh://git@github.com/owner/repo.git`
    is an ordinary remote and refusing all userinfo would break it:
      * userinfo containing `:` is a password, and is refused for every scheme;
      * for `http`/`https`, ANY userinfo is refused — nobody puts a bare username in an https git
        remote except to carry a token (`https://<PAT>@github.com/…` is the documented GitHub form).

    🔴 **Any string at all was accepted (#280).** `not-a-git-url` persisted silently and then

    a working source that happens to be empty. It is refused at the point of entry now.

#
# An installed app's SOURCE may offer a newer version than the copy on disk. We
# surface that WITHOUT a polling loop: the latest-available version is computed on
# the existing ``/api/apps`` read path from CHEAP, on-disk local-source manifest
# reads (the same dir-scan ``_scan_local_sources`` does) — no network clone on the
# hot path. The Store keeps its own (cached, network-capable) discovery for BROWSING;
# this is the always-cheap "is anything I already have out of date?" check.
#
# One notification per ``(name, latest_version)`` is delivered through the registered
# ``apps/update`` attention kind, deduped by a persisted ``entity_settings/app_updates.json``
# high-water mark so re-computing on every read never re-nags — only a version NEWER than the
# one already announced fires again.
