"""Prose-model compressor (Context Economy §2.4) — background paths ONLY.

An LLM summarizer for long natural-language text, used exclusively where latency is
already tolerable (the background compression service, the subagent-result path). It
is never wired into ``project_output``'s synchronous dispatch — the tool-dispatch
path cannot await an LLM.

Contract (guard-the-guard):
  * output = bounded summary + the raw_ref line when one exists (the road back to
    the raw bytes survives the summarization);
  * ANY failure — no resolvable model, a provider error, an over-budget response —
    degrades to the deterministic ``log`` projector, so a caller always gets a
    bounded, useful result;
  * savings are recorded under the ``prose`` compressor key (§1.3).

When AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS lands, the ``one_shot_completion`` call inherits its
chokepoint (breaker/metering) for free — no bespoke resilience built here.
