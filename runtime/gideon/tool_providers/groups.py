"""Dynamic tool-group activation (CONTEXT-ECONOMY §5).

The tool surface grows with every installed app and MCP server, and every
enabled tool's schema rides every model turn. Groups partition that surface so
**inactive groups cost (almost) zero context**: their schemas leave the tool
block and each is replaced by ONE catalog stub line.

Three properties make this safe rather than a hidden capability cliff — the
fail-open triad (mirroring :mod:`agents.native.tool_retrieval`'s stance that "a
hidden tool is a capability regression, not a safety risk"):

1. **Selection ≠ dispatch.** Deactivating a group removes SCHEMAS only. The
   runtime's ``_tool_index`` dispatch map is never filtered, so every tool stays
   callable by name — a model that ignores groups entirely still works.
2. **Stubs, not silence.** Each inactive group renders as one line naming its
   tool count and a few names, so the capability is visible at ~15 tokens
   instead of ~7 schemas.
3. **Search reaches across groups.** ``tool_search`` ranks the FULL catalog and
   annotates a hit in an inactive group with the activation step, so any tool is
   one search (or one direct call) away.

Group activation is therefore **context economy, not a security boundary**.
Structural tool DENIAL stays where it already lives: user disable
(:mod:`tool_providers.tool_prefs`) and the unattended interactive-strip, both of
which run BEFORE grouping in the runtime's assembly chain.

**Groups are derived, not hand-maintained** — one group per registered tool
provider, which is the partition the registry already keeps. The reserved
``core`` group (:data:`CORE_GROUP`) is ``always_on``: it holds the platform
providers plus every :data:`~tool_providers.tool_prefs.CORE_LOCKED` tool name
(wherever it lives) plus the runtime's synthetic meta-tools, so the primitives an
agent can't recover from losing are never deactivatable.
