"""Second-opinion verification for attention notifications (INU-6).

An attention item raised by a background agent asserts a *claim* — "a new skill would help
you", "this run needs your approval because X". Some of those claims are wrong: a proposal
built on a misread, an agent-request premise that no longer holds. This module lets a rule
ask a cheap model, before the notification fires, whether the claim is clearly refuted, and
withholds only the ones that are.

**REFUTED-only.** The verdict set is closed — ``confirmed`` / ``refuted`` / ``skipped`` —
and only an affirmative ``refuted`` withholds. ``confirmed`` and every ambiguous or
unparseable answer (``uncertain``, an empty response, garbage) resolve to ``skipped``, which
delivers the notification. The asymmetry is deliberate: silently dropping a legitimate
attention item can lose a loop that needed an answer, so the dangerous direction (a false
positive that filters a real item) is the one made hard to reach — the model must say
``REFUTED`` as its first word or in a ``{"verdict": "refuted"}`` object, nothing weaker.

**Fail-OPEN on every failure path.** No configured model, a timeout, the circuit breaker
open, the budget exhausted, an unparseable response — all return ``skipped``. The model call
goes through :func:`gideon.llm_helpers.one_shot_completion`, which wraps the resolved
provider in the ``ModelCallGuard`` (circuit breaker + hard timeout + attempt audit) at the
bridge seam, so budget/breaker exhaustion surfaces here as an exception and degrades open
rather than blocking delivery.

The public entry point the inbox hook uses is :func:`run_verification_sync`, a sync bridge
over the async :func:`verify_attention_item` — ``emit_attention_item`` is synchronous and has
many synchronous callers, so the model call is run to completion on a worker loop rather than
forcing every emitter to become a coroutine.
