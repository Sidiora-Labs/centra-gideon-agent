"""The periodic identity report — "how I've adapted to you" (LV-4).

What this is: a **long-horizon** composition over the learning artifacts that already
have live writers, rendered as one readable document. LV-3's
:mod:`gideon.learning_summary` answers "what changed lately" (deltas inside a
window); this answers "what shape have I taken" (the accumulated state). The plan's
amendment names the difference explicitly — *"the weekly digest shows deltas; the
identity report shows the accumulated shape"* — which is why the two are separate
functions over the same seams rather than one function with a flag.

Five sections, each over an existing read seam:

* **facets** — :func:`gideon.preference_facets.load_facets`, each carrying its
  class, its *decayed* stability and the live state the ambient PROFILE block uses. So
  the report cannot claim a preference is shaping replies when the decay says it is
  fading.
* **lessons** — ``MemoryService.over_vector_store(vs).get_lessons()``. (The plan's
  recon named ``learn.py::LessonStore.load_all()``; **that class was deleted by
  WF2LEA-3** and LV-3 recorded the correction — lessons live in ``memory.db
  lesson.*``.)
* **skills** — the ``auto/`` namespace from ``SkillsLoader.list_skills``, with use
  counts and recency from ``SkillUsageStore.all_usage()`` (ridden through
  ``with_usage=True``, not re-derived) and the curator's persisted aging ``status``.
* **proposals** — :func:`gideon.skills.proposals.list_pending`.
* **memory** — a subset of ``memory_stats()``.

Three properties the atom is judged on, and how each is built in:

* **Propose-don't-write.** Every read is a snapshot. Nothing here writes to a facet, a
  lesson, a skill, a proposal or the memory store — so *generating* the report cannot
  change what it reports. The delivery half writes an artifact and an inbox row, which
  are not learning stores; :func:`compose_identity_report` writes nothing at all.
* **A count is never maintained beside the thing it counts.** Every section is a
  :class:`ReportSection` whose ``count`` is ``len()`` of the full row list it was built
  from and whose ``items`` are the capped sample. A UI showing ``len(items)`` as the
  count would under-report the moment a home got busy, so the two are separate fields
  and neither derives from the other. The plan's contract spelled ``proposals_pending``
  as a bare ``int``; it is a section here for exactly this reason (recorded as a
  DEVIATION in the plan's execution log).
* **The narrative cannot invent a number.** :func:`narrate_identity_report` makes ONE
  ``one_shot_completion(use_case="background")`` call over the *already gathered* facts,
  fenced as data. Its output is prose that sits ABOVE the deterministic sections; the
  numbers are rendered from the gather verbatim and are never round-tripped through the
  model. **No-model floor:** no model, an empty completion or a raised provider error
  all yield ``narrative_status="unavailable"`` and the deterministic sections stand
  unchanged — which is why this module is mapped to ``assistant_reasoning`` in
  ``test_resilience_degraded_lint.py::_CALL_SITE_SURFACES``.

Delivery (:func:`deliver_identity_report`) persists the markdown as a **versioned
artifact** — one slug, a new version per delivery, the same choice
``knowledge_render_provider._write_spec`` made and for the same reason ("why did last
month's report look like that" has to stay answerable) — and then raises ONE attention
item through :func:`gideon.inbox.emit_attention_item`, which is the only correct
way to raise a durable agent request. Order matters: the artifact is written FIRST, so
quiet hours suppressing the ping cannot also lose the report. Never a modal.

**The cadence lives here, the clock does not.** This module owns the cadence vocabulary
(:data:`IDENTITY_REPORT_CADENCES`), what each cadence's reporting window means
(:func:`cadence_window_days`) and how a period becomes an idempotency key
(:func:`delivery_dedup_key`). The trigger that fires on it is
:mod:`gideon.action_providers.identity_report_provider`, which owns only the cron
expressions and the reconcile — so nothing here has to know a scheduler exists, and the
cron and the hand-run POST call the same :func:`deliver_identity_report`.
