"""Inbound request audit (MCP-READONLY-INBOUND §C1).

Every inbound request writes one JSONL line. This is deliberately its own log
rather than a subsection of the security event log: the SEL is the
security-relevant record (an auth failure, a cap breach), while this is the
complete request trace, including the boring successful reads — which is what you
actually need to answer "what did that client do yesterday?".

Refusals write to BOTH: here for the trace, and to the SEL because a rejected
credential on a network surface is a security event.
