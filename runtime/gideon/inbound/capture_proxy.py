"""The external-agent capture proxy — TRANSPORT half (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §7.1).

Two loopback-only routes another agent on this machine points its API base URL at:

* ``POST /capture/v1/chat/completions`` — the OpenAI dialect
* ``POST /capture/v1/messages``        — the Anthropic dialect

plus §8's one non-proxy route, mounted here so it shares the admission gate:

* ``POST /capture/import``             — stage an exported log (:func:`handle_import`)

The agent sets ``OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10000/capture/v1`` and puts the
**capture surface bearer** (§1.1) in ``OPENAI_API_KEY``. Two consequences fall out of
that single choice, and both are the point:

1. A misconfigured agent fails LOUD (401 from us) rather than open — it cannot reach
   any upstream at all without the token we minted.
2. The user's real upstream key never appears in the external agent's config. We hold
   it; the agent holds a revocable local credential. That is a strict improvement over
   pasting a provider key into every agent's dotfile.

Three rails are load-bearing here and each one is placed where it is on purpose:

**Loopback, always.** Capture never consults ``allow_remote``. It is not a data read —
it proxies the user's paid upstream credential and records full prompts, so a remote
caller reaching it is both a billing compromise and a transcript disclosure. The check
runs before any config read so no combination of settings can widen it. (The control
bridge earned the same exception at `auth.peer_allowed`; this surface takes it here
rather than there because `peer_allowed`'s remote branch is about *declared public
URLs*, a concept capture has no use for.)

**The egress guard pre-flights, before any connection.** ``net.fetch``'s buffered read
is byte-capped and cannot stream SSE, so this module dials upstream itself — which
means it also inherits the obligation `web/render.py` spells out for the headless
browser: a client that bypasses ``net.fetch`` must run ``guard.evaluate`` at its own
layer, before it opens anything. :func:`_forward` is the SOLE place a socket is opened
and the guard runs strictly before it, so a denied host is never dialed. The policy is
`net.policy.LISTED` (``allow_only=True``), which makes the operator's allow-list
**exclusive** — and therefore makes an EMPTY list refuse every host. That direction is
deliberate: for an egress allow-list, "nothing named yet" must mean "nowhere to go",
not "anywhere". A permissive empty list would turn this route into an open relay that
spends the operator's credential on any host a local agent names.

**Recording is off the hot path.** The response reaches the caller FIRST; the turn
record is handed to a background task afterwards. Sync storage inside the proxy loop is
the named anti-pattern (§7.1 "latency honesty") — it makes every captured turn slower
than an un-captured one, which is how a recording feature gets turned off. A recorder
that raises, or a `capture_store` that has not landed yet, degrades to a logged warning:
the caller always gets its bytes.
