"""The inbound tool table + the fencing wrapper (MCP-READONLY-INBOUND §C1/§C3).

Session 1 ships the TABLE MACHINERY with an empty table; Session 2 adds the five
curated read-only tools. That split is deliberate: the transport, auth, caps and
audit are verifiable on their own (an MCP client can connect and see zero tools),
and the tools then land against a substrate already proven.

The load-bearing piece here is :func:`wrap_result`. Everything an inbound tool
returns came from the user's own stores, but it flows to a MODEL — and content in
those stores can carry prompt injection (a scraped page saved to knowledge, an
inbox message). So every textual result passes through one wrapper that fences it
as data. A new tool cannot skip that, because returning anything else isn't
representable: handlers return text, and the dispatcher does the wrapping.
