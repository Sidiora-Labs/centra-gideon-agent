"""Inbound surface authentication (MCP-READONLY-INBOUND §C1).

Two independent gates, both of which must pass: the caller presents a valid
bearer token for this surface, AND the connection comes from an allowed peer.

They're separate on purpose. A token alone would make the surface reachable from
anywhere the port is; a peer check alone is not authentication at all — local port
forwarders (``socat``, ``ssh -R``) make remote traffic arrive as 127.0.0.1, which
is precisely why the dashboard's own middleware refuses to treat loopback as
proof of anything.
