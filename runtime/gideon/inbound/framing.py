"""The ONE response wrapper for every inbound surface (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §1.4).

Fencing in this codebase is *caller responsibility* — `fence_untrusted` is a helper,
not an interceptor, so a call site that forgets it produces content a model may read
as instructions. With five dialects arriving, "remember to fence" is not a control;
this module is. Every surface returns through :func:`fence_payload`, so a new dialect
physically cannot skip the data-not-instructions treatment without deleting a call it
had to write anyway.

Attribution carries the CLIENT, not just the surface (``inbound:mcp:abc123``): "an
inbound MCP caller said this" and "*this* client said this" are different claims, and
only the second lets a later audit tell which integration's content a model acted on.
