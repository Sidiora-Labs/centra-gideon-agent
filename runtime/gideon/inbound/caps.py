"""Request caps for inbound surfaces (MCP-READONLY-INBOUND §C1).

An inbound surface is the one place an outside caller sets the pace, so every
dimension it could exhaust gets a ceiling: body size, wall-clock, request rate,
concurrency, and result size. The numbers are deliberately modest — this surface
exists for a person's IDE to ask occasional questions, not to serve traffic.
