"""Telemetry import for agents that cannot be proxied (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §8).

Some agents on this machine will never point their API base URL at the §7.1
capture proxy — they are closed, or they only ever wrote a log file. §8 says such
an agent is still mineable: export its log, normalise it into the §7.2 session
record shape with a *small per-format adapter*, and then run the identical
redact → fence → stage pipeline the proxy runs. This module is the adapter set
plus the idempotence ledger; it deliberately owns no hygiene of its own.

Three deliberate boundaries:

* **Hygiene belongs to the store.** ``capture_store.stage_records`` owns
  ``redact()`` and ``fence_untrusted()``. Re-implementing either here would mint
  a second hygiene path that can drift out of step with the proxy's — the exact
  failure §7.2 designs against. The store is resolved lazily (and injectable) so
  the adapters are testable without it.
* **Malformed input is data, not an exception.** A hand-exported agent log is
  usually part rubbish: a truncated last line, an interleaved stderr banner, a
  well-formed record of a kind that carries no turn. §8 requires those be
  *skipped and counted*, so every adapter returns a :class:`ParseResult` and no
  adapter raises on content. Only a caller error (unreadable path) short-circuits,
  and it short-circuits into the same report shape.
* **Idempotence is by file content.** Re-importing the same export is a no-op,
  keyed on a SHA-256 of the file's bytes recorded in a per-home ledger.
* **The two entry points do not share an admissible path set.** ``gideon
  capture import <path>`` takes any path — a human at a shell can already read
  that file as themselves. ``POST /capture/import`` (mounted beside the proxy in
  ``capture_proxy``) reads only :func:`imports_dir`, because its bearer is a
  capture-surface token and not the shell user. Both then run the *same*
  :func:`import_capture_file`, so there is one pipeline and one hygiene path.

Reporting shape (§8): ``{imported, skipped, reasons}``, plus the content hash and
a ``duplicate`` flag so a caller can tell "already imported" from "imported
nothing".

    cannot inherit that: its bearer is a *capture-surface token* held by an external
    agent, which is far less privileged than the shell user — so a caller-chosen path
    would turn the gateway into a file-read oracle that stages any readable file

    1. **Not a bare file name.** ``../``, ``a/b`` and ``/etc/passwd`` never become a
       candidate at all — checked textually first, so nothing is stat'ed on a path the
       caller had no business naming.
    2. **Resolves out of the directory.** A *symlink* placed in the drop directory is
       the escape a name check alone cannot see, so the resolved parent is compared
       against the resolved root. Both sides are resolved because the home itself may
       sit under a symlink (``/tmp`` → ``/private/tmp`` on macOS), where comparing a
       resolved path to an unresolved root would refuse every legitimate file.
    3. **Not a file.** Reported last, and by name: "nothing dropped here yet" is the
