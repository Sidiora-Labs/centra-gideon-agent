"""Capture-session store: the persistence half of the Dialect-5 capture proxy.

EXTERNAL-ACCESS §7.2. The capture proxy (``capture_proxy.py``) and the telemetry
importer (``capture_import.py``) both land here, because both owe the *identical*
guarantee and there must be exactly one implementation of it:

**Hygiene happens AT INGESTION, never at mining time.** Before a single byte of
external-agent content reaches disk it is (a) screened by
:func:`gideon.security.redact_credentials` and (b) wrapped by
:func:`gideon.security.fence_untrusted` with ``source="capture:<client_id>"``.
That ordering is the whole security argument for this atom: when a LEARNING-FLYWHEEL
pass later reads a capture session, the content is *already* inside fences, so
``learning/hygiene.py``'s existing rule ("content inside ``fence_untrusted`` is
invisible to direct capture cadences; it may only travel the proposal path") applies
with zero new policy. An injection planted in an external agent's transcript can
therefore never direct-write a lesson. Fencing at *read* time would have been a
policy that every future reader has to remember; fencing at *write* time is a
property of the bytes.

SCREEN EACH SOURCE STRING ONCE, AT ENTRY — never over an assembled record. This is
not a style preference, it is a measured defect. ``_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS`` matches the
``api_key=`` prefix *as part of* the credential span, so screening the composed line
``api_key=sk-ant-api03-…`` collapses the whole thing to ``[REDACTED: credential]`` and
**destroys the field name**, while screening the value alone yields
``api_key=[REDACTED: credential]`` and keeps the record readable. A trailing
chokepoint over a finished record is therefore strictly worse than per-field
screening, which is why :func:`_screen` is called at every field boundary and never
once at the end.

The second half of the same hazard governs how callers may use the returned warning
list: a second pass over already-redacted text returns ``(unchanged_text, [])``.
``found`` is only trustworthy **on first contact**. Any vacuity floor ("prove the
redactor would have caught this") must assert against a screen of the *raw* source,
because a re-screen of scrubbed text reads as clean and would make the floor vacuous.

Latency honesty: recording is post-hoc. The proxy responds to its caller first, then
persists off the hot path via :func:`record_turn_async`, which is an
``asyncio.to_thread`` wrapper — sync file IO in the async proxy loop is the known
anti-pattern this avoids.

:func:`record_turn` NEVER raises. A capture store that can break the proxy it observes
is worse than no capture store: the user's actual agent traffic must not fail because
a record could not be serialized. Every failure degrades to "this turn went
unrecorded", logged at debug, and the caller is unharmed.

    """Index one captured turn into ``learning.db``'s staging tier. **NEVER raises.**

    The FOURTH capture cadence (``Cadence.CAPTURE``), beside per-turn, session-end and
    run-end — the plan's own framing: the capture proxy feeds the existing flywheel
    machinery as a new source and "must not grow a parallel learning pipeline". This is
    that hookup, and it is the whole of it: the row lands whether or not any mining pass
    exists to read it, so capture is durable even with flywheel steps 1-3 absent.

    **The row carries the fence; it does not bypass it.** ``content`` is the sidecar's
    ALREADY-fenced prompt/response verbatim. Two properties depend on that, and both are
    lost by "helpfully" re-processing here:

    * Re-screening is worse than useless. ``redact_credentials`` populates ``found`` only
      on first contact and matches the ``key=`` prefix *inside* the credential span, so a
      second pass over persisted text reports clean and would destroy field names. Every
      source string was screened once at its own boundary in :func:`_build_record`.
    * Staging the *unfenced* text would defeat the ingestion fence entirely. Because the
      content stays fenced, ``capture_hygiene``'s existing rule — fenced spans are
      invisible to direct capture cadences and may travel only the proposal path — makes
      an injection planted in an external agent's transcript un-actionable from
      ``learning.db`` with zero new policy.

    Returns the staging row id, or 0 when nothing was staged (deduplicated, learning off,
    or a store failure). Failure is silent-but-logged for the same reason
    :func:`record_turn` never raises: a staging problem must not cost the captured turn.
