"""`POST /mcp` — JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP (MCP-READONLY-INBOUND §C2).

The minimum an MCP client needs to connect and enumerate: `initialize`,
`tools/list`, `tools/call`. Deliberately NOT implemented:

* **No SSE stream** (`GET /mcp` → 405). The spec permits a POST-only server, and a
  long-lived stream is a second lifecycle to get right for no v1 benefit.
* **No batch requests.** A batch multiplies one authenticated request into N
  handler invocations, which complicates every cap (rate, deadline, result size).
  Refused with a clear JSON-RPC error rather than half-supported.

Order of checks matters and is deliberate: enablement → peer → token → rate →
concurrency → body size → parse. Each rejects with the least information that
still lets a legitimate client fix its call, and every rejection is audited.

# The MCP protocol revision this surface implements.
#
# **Why 2025-06-18 and not something newer** (the G1.1 conformance review, recorded here
# because the choice is the deliverable, not the string):
#
# The rule is "advertise a revision this surface ACTUALLY conforms to, verified clause by
# clause — not the newest string available." Checked against what this code does:
#
# * **Streamable HTTP, POST-only.** The spec permits a server that only accepts POST and
#   answers `GET` with 405, which is exactly `handle_mcp_get`. No SSE stream to get right.
# * **Stateless.** No `Mcp-Session-Id` is issued or required. The spec's own direction is
#   toward stateless servers, so this is alignment rather than a gap. Re-introducing session
#   handling to satisfy an older client would be a regression dressed as compatibility.
# * **`initialize` / `tools/list` / `tools/call`** are implemented with the result shapes the
#   revision specifies; `capabilities` advertises only `tools`, which is all this surface has.
# * **No batching.** 2025-06-18 REMOVED JSON-RPC batching, so this surface's long-standing
#   refusal of batches is now conformant rather than a deliberate deviation — one of the two
#   reasons this revision is the right target.
# * **Origin validation / DNS-rebinding guidance.** Satisfied more strictly than the spec
#   asks: `auth.peer_allowed` gates on the TRANSPORT peer (never a forgeable header), and a
#   non-loopback peer additionally needs `allow_remote` *and* an exact `Host` match against
#   the owner-declared `public_url`. An `Origin` check would be strictly weaker than this.
#
# **Deliberately unmet clauses of LATER drafts:** anything requiring server→client requests
# (elicitation, sampling) or a resumable event stream is out of scope for a read-only,
# POST-only surface, and OAuth-based authorization is expressly this plan's non-goal — the
# surface uses a dedicated bearer token distinct from the dashboard's. Advertising a revision
# that mandates those would be a false claim, which is exactly what this review is for.

# anything else gets a typed error naming these, rather than a silent partial handshake where

# `2024-11-05` stays supported because it is what this surface advertised before the bump and
# what already-configured clients pin. The difference that matters between the two — batching —
# was never supported here, so honoring the older revision is honest: a 2024-11-05 client gets
