"""The layered admission gate every inbound surface passes through (§1.1, §1.3).

Four kill switches stack here, and a request must clear all four:

1. **master** — ``external_access.enabled``. Off unmounts all five surfaces.
2. **per-surface** — ``external_access.<surface>.enabled``.
3. **per-client** — the client record's own ``disabled`` flag, enforced in
   ``clients.lookup_by_token`` rather than here (see the note at the bottom).
4. **incident mode** — AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS' ``~/.gideon/incident.json``. An
   active incident refuses every inbound request with 503, the same one-check
   pattern the other execution seams use.

Every one of them parses **fail-CLOSED**, which is the INVERSE of `guard_flag`.
Stated loudly because the inversion looks like a bug to anyone who learned the
guardrails convention first: a *guard* that cannot read its flag must keep
protecting (fail ON), while an *inbound surface* that cannot read its flag must
refuse to answer (fail OFF). Both rules say "ambiguity resolves toward safety";
safety points in opposite directions for the two. Do not "fix" this to be lenient.

Why a module rather than a method on each dialect: five dialects each re-deriving
"am I allowed to serve this?" is five chances for the fourth one to forget the
incident check. There is one function, and adding a surface means calling it.
