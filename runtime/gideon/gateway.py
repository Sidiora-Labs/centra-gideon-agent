"""Gateway process orchestrator for Gideon.

Manages the lifecycle of all runtime services: session manager, cron
scheduler, context builder, heartbeat, autonudge, inbox, MCP discovery,
subagents, task runner, dashboard / API server, update checks, and signal
handling. This is the core process boot — it runs with or without any external
channel configured.

Channel connectivity is optional and pluggable via the channel-transport seam:
each registered transport's ``start_inbound`` runs at boot (Slack Socket-Mode
lives entirely in the ``slack-channel`` app bundle), and the transport registers
its outbound :class:`~gideon.channel_delivery.ChannelDelivery` on the
orchestrator. Core imports NO vendor channel code. With no channel configured the
gateway runs dashboard-only.
