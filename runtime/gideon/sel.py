"""Security Event Log — immutable, tamper-evident audit trail for tool invocations.

Records structured JSON events for every tool/MCP action with:

- Caller identity (session key, agent, source interface)
- Operation type (tool_call, tool_approved, tool_rejected, tool_denied, mcp_call)
- Resources affected (tool name, tool kind, arguments summary)
- Outcome (approved, rejected, denied, completed, failed)
- Downstream service (MCP server name if applicable)
- HMAC-SHA256 integrity chain (each entry signs over previous hash)

        it newest-first, so an ``offset`` is unstable by construction: append *k* entries
        between page 1 and page 2 and every element shifts *k* places toward the tail, so
        page 2 re-serves *k* rows the operator already saw — and a concurrent ``prune()``
        shifts the other way and SKIPS rows. Skipping rows in an audit trail is the
        failure that matters: the surface would omit events while looking complete.

        ``cursor`` is the ``event_id`` of the last row of the previous page. A page is the
        next ``limit`` matching records strictly OLDER than that anchor (earlier in file
        order). Appends land strictly newer than the anchor, so they cannot enter or
        shift any page taken after it — pages 2..N are stable under concurrent writes,
        while page 1 (no cursor) still shows the true live tail.

        An anchor that is no longer in the scanned window (pruned, or rotated out)
        returns ``cursor_found=False`` — the caller REFUSES rather than silently
        restarting from the newest record, which would re-serve the whole log as if it
        were new.

        Reads stay O(tail): at most ``scan_cap`` trailing lines are ever touched.
        Per-record ``integrity_ok`` is computed on the RAW line, before redaction —
        redacting first would rewrite the payload the HMAC covers and report every
        record as tampered.
