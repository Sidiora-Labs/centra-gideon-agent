"""Data-event triggers (#38) — the event-pattern layer of the triggers facade.

The third trigger kind alongside ``schedule`` (clock) and ``lifecycle`` (agent-loop
event): an **event** trigger fires when PClaw's own state changes. v1 exposes the
cheapest source — memory writes (``vector_memory._log_event``):

- **MemoryUpdate**     — any memory write (create/update/delete).
- **MemoryKeyPattern** — a write whose key matches a glob (``project.acme.*``).
- **ContentMatch**     — a write whose value matches a regex/substring.

Each spec carries an action (reusing the action-provider registry) + an optional
``max_fires`` so a trigger auto-disables once exhausted ("alert me the NEXT time X").
A per-spec debounce + a global rate cap guard against trigger storms.

This is deliberately a small, decoupled engine: ``vector_memory`` calls
``emit_memory_event`` best-effort (never blocking a write), and the registry persists
specs as JSON like crons. Folds into ``triggers-unification`` as its event layer.

#: How much of a memory value `ContentMatch` will scan.
#:
#: §7/R4 rule (d) — "payload content never participates in event-pattern matching; only trigger spec
#: patterns match, payload is data" — HOLDS here and was verified rather than assumed: the regex
#: comes
#: from `trigger.content_re` and the value is only ever matched against. Nothing lets payload text
#: supply a pattern, and `render_template` does not re-expand a substituted value (checked in S126).
#:
#: 4 KB because a `ContentMatch` trigger asks "does this memory value mention X", and a mention that
#: first appears past 4 KB is not what anyone is watching for. Applied to the SCAN only, never
#: to what
#: is stored or fired — truncating the value itself would silently change what the automation sees.

#: 🔴 **THIS CAP DOES NOT FIX ReDoS, and saying so matters.** Measured on this very function: an
#: author regex of `(a+)+$` — a shape people write by accident, not an attack — takes 0.66s at 24
#: characters, 2.5s at 26, 10.2s at 28, 40.7s at 30. It is EXPONENTIAL in length, so a 4096-char cap
#: bounds nothing useful; a cap that looked like a fix would be worse than none, because the next
#: reader would stop looking. The cap's real value is bounding the LINEAR cost of a sane regex
#: over a
#: large value. Catastrophic patterns are addressed where they are authored — see
#: `catastrophic_regex_hint`.
CONTENT_MATCH_SCAN_LIMIT = 4096

#: Regex constructs whose backtracking is exponential: a quantifier applied to a group that is
#: itself
#: quantified (`(a+)+`, `(a*)*`, `(a+)*`) or an alternation-in-a-quantified-group (`(a|a)+`). These
#: are the two shapes behind essentially every real ReDoS, and both are almost always an accident —
