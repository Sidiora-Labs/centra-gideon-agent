"""Data-event triggers (#38) — the event-pattern layer of the triggers facade.

The third trigger kind alongside ``schedule`` (clock) and ``lifecycle`` (agent-loop
event): an **event** trigger fires when PClaw's own state changes. The vocabulary is
**source-agnostic** (EIAT-1): every event carries a ``source`` and a source can never
fire another source's trigger.

Memory writes (``vector_memory._log_event``) — ``source="memory"``:

- **MemoryUpdate**     — any memory write (create/update/delete).
- **MemoryKeyPattern** — a write whose key matches a glob (``project.acme.*``).
- **ContentMatch**     — a write whose value matches a regex/substring.

Inbox messages (``inbox_service._ingest``, after the allowlist) — ``source="inbox"``:

- **InboxMessage**     — any accepted inbox message from a watched source.
- **InboxSender**      — a message whose sender matches ``sender_glob``.
- **InboxAddress**     — a message whose receiving address matches ``address_glob``.

App-contributed sources (``trigger_sources.emit``, AUTO-A4) — ``source="app"``:

- **AppEvent**         — an event from an installed app's ``trigger_source`` provider, whose
  namespaced name (``app:<app>:<event>``) matches ``event_glob``. An empty glob matches every app
  event. The payload is fenced at ingestion with the app's provenance, so the app's own text can
  never arrive as instructions.

Each spec carries an action (reusing the action-provider registry) + an optional
``max_fires`` so a trigger auto-disables once exhausted ("alert me the NEXT time X").
A per-spec debounce + a global rate cap guard against trigger storms.

This is deliberately a small, decoupled engine: every source calls the ONE emitter
``emit_event`` best-effort (never blocking the source's own work), and the registry
persists specs as JSON like crons. Folds into ``triggers-unification`` as its event
layer.
