"""One SQLite binding + capability probe for the whole codebase (PLATFORM-REACH PR-1).

Six modules each carried their own ``try: import pysqlite3 as sqlite3 / except
ImportError: import sqlite3`` (and one carried a bare ``import sqlite3``), so the
driver choice was decided seven times and a test that patched the stdlib module
missed the modules that had bound ``pysqlite3``. This module makes that choice
ONCE: import :data:`sqlite3` from here and every caller shares the same driver.

``pysqlite3`` (the ``pysqlite3-binary`` wheel) ships a newer SQLite than some
platforms' bundled stdlib build — notably one WITH FTS5 + JSON1 — which the
knowledge/memory search paths need. Preferring it when present, falling back to
the stdlib otherwise, is the platform-portability the plan is about; the probe
below reports what actually resolved so the doctor can show it.
