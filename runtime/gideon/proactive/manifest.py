"""Stage 1 — Collect: the digest's ordinal manifest (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.1).

The manifest is the pipeline's *anti-hallucination contract*. Every later stage — the
classifier gate, the strict-JSON proposal call, the ranking, the digest body — addresses an
item by the ordinal assigned HERE (`"1"`, `"2"`, …) and by nothing else. A proposal naming
an id the manifest never minted is refused rather than repaired, because "repair" means
guessing which of the user's messages a model meant, and a wrong guess archives the wrong
thing.

Two properties make that contract worth having, and both are properties of this module:

**Ordinals are a function of the collected set, not of arrival order.** `build_manifest`
sorts before numbering (source lane, then timestamp, then source id), so two collects over
the same window mint the same ordinals. Without that, a re-collect after a gateway restart
would renumber the window and a reply that said `3 yes` would act on a different item —
which is success criterion 9's wrong-target execution, reached without any adversary.

**One real item is one ordinal.** Deduplication is by fingerprint, and the fingerprint is
derived from provenance (source + source id) rather than from rendered text, so an item
whose title was re-rendered is still the same item, while two genuinely different messages
that happen to share a subject line stay two.

Nothing here reads the clock, the network or a model: a manifest is a pure function of the
rows the collectors handed over, which is what lets the ordinal contract be asserted
directly instead of inferred from a digest body.
