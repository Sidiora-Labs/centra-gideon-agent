"""Stage 3.5 — trivial-tier auto-execution, quadruple-bounded (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.6).

The sharpest edge in the plan: the point where a model's proposal becomes a write nobody
watched. §1.6 bounds it four ways, and all four are enforced HERE rather than requested in a
prompt, because a bound a prompt asks for is a bound an injected inbox item can ask to skip:

1. **The switch.** ``proactive.auto_execute_enabled`` is off by default. Off means this stage
   dispatches nothing, reads no budget, and returns every proposal deferred — the plan's
   one-click revoke, and the reason it is checked first is that a revoked switch must not even
   spend a store read.
2. **The frozen capability set** (substrate decision 7). A proposal names an ``action_type``,
   never a provider; :data:`PROVIDER_FOR_ACTION` is the only thing that turns one into a
   dispatch, and the provider it names must ALSO be in the caller's declared capability set.
   Two independent gates, so neither an unmapped action nor an undeclared provider can execute.
3. **The per-run cap.** ``max_auto_actions_per_run`` (default 5). The rest queue pending
   regardless of tier — a hundred trivial archives is still a hundred unattended writes.
4. **The NEW-1 budget floor**, consulted before EVERY action rather than once per run: a run
   that starts under its ceiling can cross it mid-flight, and a single check at the top would
   authorise the whole batch on the strength of the cheapest moment in it.

Eligibility itself is the fifth bound and the one that makes the other four meaningful: only a
``trivial``-tier proposal or one a taught always-approve rule matched is a candidate. Tier is
policy-clamped upstream (`proposals.clamp_tier` only ever RAISES), so "a jailbroken item cannot
self-assign trivial" holds by construction and this module never re-reads the model's ask.

**The budget check fails CLOSED here, unlike `triggers/screen.py`'s.** That module's budget gate
fails OPEN, correctly: it decides whether a trigger FIRES AT ALL, and a hung probe that stopped
every automation on the machine would be a worse outage than one unverified fire. This gate
decides whether an unattended WRITE happens, and its fallback is not an outage — the proposal
queues pending and the user sees it in the digest, which is exactly where it would have been
anyway. Nothing is lost by refusing, so refusing is the honest direction.

Nothing here reads the clock or the config: ``now``, ``cap`` and ``enabled`` are parameters, so
a test drives the whole ladder without a config file and the caller stays the only place that
decides what "today" and "the ceiling" mean.
