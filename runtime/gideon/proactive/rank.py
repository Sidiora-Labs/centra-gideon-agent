"""Stage 5 — rank + render (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.5).

Ranking is the substrate's materiality order and nothing else (`MATERIALITY_ORDER`, AUTO-R2):
runs that touched the world lead, errors follow, words follow those, noise sinks. Re-deriving
a second weighting here — "importance", "urgency" — would be a fifth dialect for the same
question the Run Ledger already answers, so this module consumes that vocabulary rather than
inventing beside it.

Rendering is deliberately deterministic and deliberately NOT a model call. A digest whose body
was written by a model is a second place injected content can reach a human, and the §1.3 call
has already been paid; the body here is assembled from typed fields the pipeline holds. That
also makes the digest assertable: a test can require that a dropped item's title is absent,
which is the property the gate's refusal path only *means* something through.

The digest is `info`-ranked on purpose. `notification_allowed` defers `info` inside quiet
hours, which for a MORNING digest is the correct behaviour rather than a limitation — success
criterion 1 asks for exactly that deferral.

    as a ranked list. A window the gate emptied renders the "nothing needs you" line rather
    than an empty body, because a blank digest reads as a broken digest.

    `auto_lines` is §1.6 bound 4's half of the first section: what the machine did WITHOUT
    being asked, each line naming the rule that authorised it. It joins the run lane under one
    heading rather than getting its own, because "what your machine did" is one question and
    two headings would make the user read twice to answer it — and it is rendered FIRST inside
    that section, since an action already taken outranks a run that merely finished.

    **`proposals` must be the PENDING set, not the batch.** The caller auto-executes before
    rendering (`pipeline.run_triage`), so anything that ran is in `auto_lines`; passing the
