"""The five-stage triage pipeline, wired end to end (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.1-§1.5).

`run_triage` is the whole digest: collect → gate → ONE proposal call → rank → deliver. The
stages themselves are pure and live beside this module; what is here is the *order*, the two
model calls, and the four spend decisions that make the order defensible:

1. **Nothing collected ⇒ nothing spent.** The manifest is built before any model is reachable,
   and an empty manifest returns immediately with `llm_calls == 0`. That is §1.2's
   precondition guard: one cheap store read decides whether the expensive stages run at all.
2. **No rules ⇒ no gate call.** Delegated to `should_call_gate`, which also honours the
   `classifier_gate_enabled` switch.
3. **Nothing survived the gate ⇒ no proposal call.** A window the user's own rules emptied
   still produces a digest (so they can see the filter worked), but it produces it for free.
4. **Exactly one proposal call, ever.** No retry against the schema — a parse miss degrades to
   a plain digest. `output_type=dict` already buys one targeted retry inside
   `one_shot_completion` on the providers that enforce schemas; layering a second retry here
   would spend a third call on the same fenced content.

Both calls resolve on the **background** axis (`use_case="background"`), never the chat axis,
and both go through `render_use_case_prompt` so the user can edit them in Settings → Prompts
like every other internal prompt.

`completion` and `deliver` are injectable, defaulting to the real
`one_shot_completion` / `DashboardState.notify` path. That is not a test seam bolted on: a
digest is an unattended scheduled run, and the two things it does that can fail on someone
else's infrastructure are the two things a caller may need to supply — the provider passes the
defaults, so the production path is the default path.

    quiet-hours suppression for anything below `error`. A digest is `info`, so quiet hours DEFER
