"""The ad-hoc→template gate's CALL SITE: decide, record the refusal, file a draft.

``learning.detectors`` holds the decision (a deterministic chain plus a structural score) and is
documented as pure — "nothing here calls a model, writes memory, or files a proposal". That purity
is worth keeping, and it is also exactly why the chain shipped inert: ``detectors.gate()`` had
**zero production callers**, so no real run was ever evaluated, no refusal was ever recorded, and
the ``Skip`` enum's whole premise — that "a count per reason says which gate is doing the work and
which is dead weight" — had no data behind it. A gate nothing calls cannot decline anything.

This module is the missing half, and only that half:

* **decide** by delegating to ``detectors.gate`` (no second copy of the thresholds);
* **record** every negative decision as a ``FLUSH_SKIPPED`` row carrying the TYPED ``Skip`` value,
  reusing the same ledger ``gate.record_denial`` writes to rather than minting a parallel one — two
  skip ledgers would make "why did nothing get captured this week" a two-query question with two
  possible answers;
* **file** an accepted candidate as a PENDING ``template`` proposal.

Filing is never installing. ``proposals.enqueue`` returns a row a human accepts or rejects, so even
the ``AUTO_FILE`` branch — which deliberately spends zero model calls — cannot put a template into
the library on its own. That is what makes a free auto-file safe: the cost it skips is the model's,
not the reviewer's.
