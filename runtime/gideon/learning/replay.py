"""Local A/B replay harness — evidence on captured sessions (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §9, EA-6).

The Proposal Inbox asks a user to accept a skill or template the system wrote itself. The
only evidence it can carry today is *provenance* (where the idea came from) and, for a
template diff, the Loop-2 gate's before/after over the shipped scenario library. Neither
answers the question a reviewer actually has: **would this have helped on MY work?**

This module answers it from the one corpus that is genuinely the user's own — the capture
sessions the inbound proxy already writes (``inbound/capture_store.py``, EA-5). It mines a
handful of real turns, replays each one twice (without the candidate, then with it), scores
both arms with the same judge, and attaches the pair to the proposal.

## What this is NOT

**It is not a gate.** :func:`attach` writes onto a PENDING proposal and touches neither
``status`` nor ``updated_at``; ``proposals.accept`` never reads the field. A ``regressed``
verdict is a sentence on a card, and the human still decides — exactly the contract
``Proposal.gate`` already documents for the Loop-2 gate ("never a reason to refuse the
accept"). A measurement that could block would make this the thing that stops a user
shipping a change because the *harness* broke, and would quietly convert the flywheel's
human-installs invariant into a machine veto. ``tests/test_ea6_replay_harness.py`` asserts
it directly: a ``regressed`` verdict still accepts.

**It never touches** :mod:`gideon.evals.runner`. That runner is the right tool for the
Loop-2 gate — it spawns a child process against a throwaway ``GIDEON_HOME`` so a staged
artifact cannot contaminate the real one. Here it would be the hazard rather than the
isolation: this pass runs INSIDE the gateway's consolidation tick, in the same process as
every live session, and an env mutation on that path is visible to every concurrent reader of
``config_dir()``. So the two halves are composed directly instead —
:func:`~gideon.llm_helpers.one_shot_completion` for the arms and
:class:`~gideon.eval.judge.LLMJudge` for the score — the same composition
``sampling._judge_candidates`` and ``loop/judge.assess_cycle`` already use.
``test_never_imports_the_eval_runner`` is the regression.

## What an arm actually is

The baseline arm sends the captured prompt as it was. The candidate arm sends the same
prompt with the proposal's body prepended as available context, under a fence. That is not a
simulation of skill injection — it *is* how a skill reaches a turn (the learning block is
prompt text), so the difference between the arms is precisely the candidate's presence. Both
arms run at ``use_case="background"``, both are judged against the SAME criteria derived from
the proposal, and the criteria are built once per proposal rather than per arm: a comparison
whose rubric moves between arms measures the rubric.

## Three states, and why the third exists

``state`` is two-valued (``replayed`` / ``unreplayed``) and ``verdict`` four-valued, giving a
card three distinct things to say — the same shape ``evals.gate.summary`` established and
``learningMeta.gateLabel`` renders:

* **replayed, with means** — ``improved`` / ``neutral`` / ``regressed``.
* **replayed, no scored case** — every mined case was rejected. ``candidate_mean`` and
  ``baseline_mean`` are ``None`` and the verdict is ``unmeasured``.
* **unreplayed** — no cases were mined, the budget was exhausted, or replay is off. Carries a
  ``reason`` and, for the budget case, ``deferred=True`` so the card says "deferred on the
  learning replay budget" rather than going quiet.

The means are ``None``, never ``0.0``, whenever nothing was scored. An empty scored set that
publishes a mean publishes a fabricated one: ``0.0`` reads as "the candidate answered
nothing correctly", which is a measurement nobody made and points the reviewer the wrong
way. This is the house rule ``optimize.SCORE_UNSCORED`` and ``learningMeta.evidenceLabel``
already hold, and :func:`summary` is where it is enforced for this surface.

## parse-failure → 0, and REJECT

``LLMJudge.judge_turn`` returns ``JudgeVerdict(score=0, reason="parse_error: …")`` when the
judge's output cannot be parsed. This module reads that as a **rejected case**, not a scored
zero and not a skip:

* counting it as ``0.0`` would drag whichever arm failed to parse toward a regression verdict
  on the strength of a broken *judge*;
* dropping it silently would let a proposal claim a clean two-case mean when four cases ran.

So a case whose either arm fails to parse is excluded from both means and counted in
``rejected``, which the card renders. Zero is a legitimate score when the judge *says* zero;
the discriminator is the ``parse_error`` reason, and ``test_a_parse_failure_rejects_the_case``
pins that the two are not the same outcome.

## The bound

Replay spends real money on the maintenance tick, so the ceiling is structural rather than
promised. :func:`replay_proposal` binds a learning-scope run key and a
:class:`~gideon.guardrails.budgets.Budget` into the two ContextVars
:class:`~gideon.guardrails.model_call.ModelCallGuard` reads, and the guard — which
already wraps every provider at the ``provider_bridge`` seam — does both halves itself:
``check_run`` before each call, ``charge(run_key=…)`` after. There is no second tally here,
and no way for a call on this path to escape the meter.

Following ``evals/gate.py``'s doctrine exactly: an **unbudgeted** replay does not run
unbounded, it does not run at all. ``Budget(max_dollars=0)`` is UNLIMITED, which is the one
thing a pass on the maintenance cadence must never be, so a non-positive
``learning.replay_max_dollars`` yields ``unreplayed`` + :data:`UNREPLAYED_NO_BUDGET`.
