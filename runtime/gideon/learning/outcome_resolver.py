"""The pending-outcome resolver — a decision's bet gets graded once its horizon elapses.

LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 (LEARN-R18). A decision-producing workflow run journals a `pending_outcome`
at DECISION time — before the answer is knowable — recording the `subject` it decided, the `metric`
that will reveal whether it was right, the `horizon_secs` after which that metric is meaningful, and
the `baseline` to beat. This module is the other half: a background one-shot on the curator tick
that, for every open question whose horizon has passed, measures ground truth, scores it relative to
the baseline, journals an `outcome_resolved` (closing the question), and files a lesson PROPOSAL
citing the measured figure and the run.

Two rules mirror the rest of the flywheel:

**Inert unless a memory service with a live vector store is injected.** Ground truth is read from
semantic memory; with no vector store there is nothing to measure and nothing to resolve, so
:func:`resolve` returns an empty report immediately.

**Propose, never install.** The graded lesson is a `lesson_batch` proposal through the shared
human-gated queue — a measured outcome is stronger evidence than a hunch, but it still does not get
to write a standing instruction without a person accepting it.

**Idempotent.** Each `outcome_resolved` cites the `pending_event_id` of the question it closes, so a
second curator tick reads the resolution, sees the question is answered, and skips it. A run whose
metric cannot be read after the horizon resolves as "inconclusive" — a real closure that decays
faster than a measured one, so a permanently unreadable metric neither re-resolves forever nor
masquerades as a confirmed outcome.

The `pending_outcome` events themselves are journal records, and the journal is append-only by
contract (never rewritten), so an open question is inherently exempt from the lesson/memory eviction
the curator runs elsewhere — it survives until its horizon, however far out.
