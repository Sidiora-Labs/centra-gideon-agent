"""The outcome resolver — every open bet gets graded once its horizon elapses.

LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 (LEARN-R18), generalized by PP-9. A producer journals a `pending_outcome`
at BET time — before the answer is knowable — recording what it did (`subject`), the `metric` that
will reveal whether it landed, where that metric is read from (`metric_source`), the `horizon_secs`
after which it is meaningful, and the `baseline` to beat. This module is the other half: a
background one-shot on the curator tick that, for every open question whose horizon has passed,
reads ground truth, scores it against the baseline, journals an `outcome_resolved` (closing the
question), and — for the producers whose bets are lessons — files a graded PROPOSAL citing the
measured figure and the run.

The facility, its producer vocabulary and its two resolutions live in
:mod:`gideon.ledger.outcomes`; this module is one resolver over all of them, not one
resolver per producer. Adding a producer means opening questions, not editing this file.

**Two metric sources, two availability rules.** A memory-sourced metric (a decision's ground truth)
needs a live vector store; with none there is nothing to read, so those questions stay OPEN rather
than resolving as inconclusive — "nobody could look yet" is a different fact from "the metric is
unreadable". A ledger-sourced metric (an escalation's answer) is an event the producer wrote
itself, so it resolves on any box.

**Propose, never install.** A graded lesson is a `lesson_batch` proposal through the shared
human-gated queue — a measured outcome is stronger evidence than a hunch, but it still does not get
to write a standing instruction without a person accepting it. Only the producers whose bet IS a
lesson propose (see `outcomes.PRODUCER_*` and `_PROPOSING_PRODUCERS`): an artifact nobody read is a
fact for `PP-10`'s dormancy sweep to interpret, not a lesson to file on the spot, and filing one
per publish would nag the user with something they cannot act on.

**Idempotent.** Each `outcome_resolved` cites the `pending_event_id` of the question it closes, so
a second tick reads the resolution, sees the question is answered, and skips it — the subtraction
happens once, in `outcomes.open_questions`. A question whose metric cannot be read after the
horizon resolves as "inconclusive": a real closure that decays faster than a measured one (see
`outcomes.DECAY_PROFILE`), so a permanently unreadable metric neither re-resolves forever nor
masquerades as a confirmed outcome.

The `pending_outcome` events themselves are ledger records, and the ledger is append-only by
contract (never rewritten), so an open question is inherently exempt from the lesson/memory
eviction the curator runs elsewhere — it survives until its horizon, however far out.
