"""Repeated ad-hoc work → templates; failed stages → typed lessons (§3.2/§3.3 — S74).

Two spokes that share one discipline: a DETERMINISTIC gate chain decides, and a model is consulted
only at the score boundary. §3.2 is explicit that this replaces "pure LLM-prompt branches" — the
previous shape asked a model whether something was template-worthy, which costs a call per
candidate and answers differently on Tuesday.

The chain, in order (LEARN-R13):

1. **Hard pre-gates.** Plan ≥2 steps; no template already surfaced for the run; budget burn ≤80%.
   Near-death plans make bad templates: a run that spent its budget flailing is not a procedure.
2. **A deterministic structural score.** Action-verb diversity, inter-step dependencies,
   parameterizable slots, −1 per hardcoded entity. Free, reproducible, and the thing thresholds get
   tuned against.
3. **The LLM runs ONLY at the score boundary.** A high score auto-FILES with zero model calls; a low
   score is dropped; only the ambiguous middle is worth paying for.
4. **Every negative decision writes a `skipped(reason)` row.** §3.2: the flywheel's negative space
   how thresholds get tuned" — a detector that silently declines is one nobody can calibrate.

**Measured before writing.** `is_environment_failure_claim` — §3.3's deny-filter, the guardrail that
keeps a flaky network from becoming a durable lesson — caught **1 of 4** real environment failures:
"connection refused", `ECONNRESET`, and rate-limit noise all passed straight through. §3.3 routes
every
`step_failed` through it, which made the gap worse, so this session widened it (now 12/12,
with 0 false positives on real lessons — a bare `429` had been filtering "the 429 rate limiter
config
lives in settings.py").

Pure decisions. Nothing here calls a model, writes memory, or files a proposal.
