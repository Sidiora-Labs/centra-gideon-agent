"""One ranked slot allocator — what reaches the prompt, and in what shape.

Four entity families (lessons, skills, memory, retrieved context) each decided
independently how much prompt weight to take. That is not a budget; it is four
budgets that happen to share a window, and the visible consequence is in
`context.py`: the lesson block gets **character-truncated mid-sentence** when it
runs long. Lessons are the user's own corrections — the single most authoritative
thing in the prompt — and they were the block being cut, because whoever appended
last won.

**A budget is a ranking algorithm, not a token counter.** Counting tokens tells you
that you are over; it does not tell you what to drop. So:

**Per-entity thresholds stay as ENTRY gates.** The 0.55 skill gate was calibrated
for short descriptions and the routing gate at 0.62 for longer match text — the
code comments document the calibration. A single joint threshold would silently
recalibrate both. Named profiles carry the rationale forward; recalibration happens
when measurement shows the split unjustified, not when it looks untidy.

**One salience pool after the gates.** Candidates from every family compete on
`(0.55·query_overlap + 0.45·score) × 0.85^rank × entity_prior`, with priors near
1.0 — relevance must dominate source identity, or the pool becomes the old
per-family allocation wearing a ranking costume.

**Slots have priorities, and exactly one is sacrificial.** Truncation applies only
to retrieved context. Instructions and lessons are never crowded out. An oversized
item **skips rather than truncates** — half a lesson is worse than no lesson,
because the reader cannot tell it is half.

**Tiered rendering degrades before it drops.** Every entity carries L0 (one line),
L1 (operational summary), L2 (full body). The allocator lowers tier before removing
an item, and closes with an L0 catalogue of near-misses so the model knows what
exists and can ask — a dropped item the model never learns about is a silent gap.

**The authority preamble counters a measured failure.** Perfect injection, and the
agent re-searches everything anyway. Three lines stating that injected content is
authoritative over model priors, and that a question already answered here is not
novel.
