"""The run-end learner — a terminal workflow run mines its own Run Ledger for lessons.

LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 (§7 step 5), the RUN_END cadence. When a run reaches a terminal state
the controller routes it through the `LearningGate` (permission: not ephemeral, not restricted,
learning enabled, this cadence on) and then calls :func:`capture`. This module is the RUN_END
sibling of `self_model_observer.observe_turn` (PER_TURN) and the consolidation envelope
(SESSION_END), and it is built to the same two rules:

**Inert unless a memory service with a live vector store is injected.** `capture` returns an
empty report the moment `service` is None or `has_vector` is False — the exact guard
`self_model_observer.observe_turn` uses. So every terminal-run controller test (which passes no
memory service) writes nothing, and an embedder-less box learns nothing rather than crashing.

**Propose, never install.** A failed step files a `lesson_batch` PROPOSAL through the shared
human-gated queue (`learning.proposals.enqueue`) — the same queue every other inferred lesson
clears. Nothing here writes a live `lesson.*` row; that happens only when the human accepts. This
closes the injection hole the plan names: a run's own failure text can no longer become a standing
instruction without a person in the loop.

What a terminal run contributes (§3.3):

- **Lesson proposal per distinct terminal failure**, through the env-failure deny-filter
  (`lesson_worthy` / `is_environment_failure_claim` — a flaky network is not a lesson), keyed by
  `(template, failure_mode, signature)` (LEARN-R8a/b) so the same mechanism failing twice is ONE
  proposal and the lesson can be re-injected on future runs of the template.
- **A failure CAPSULE** (LEARN-R8d): repro command + failure signature + forbidden success modes
  + bounded evidence, rendered into the proposal body so a later replay can verify the lesson
  still applies rather than re-reading prose.
- **A procedural prior** per failed step (`record_procedural(tool="workflow:<template>/<step>",
  outcome="failed")`) — the existing ≥3-failure synthesis then surfaces the prior next time the
  template is planned, for free.
