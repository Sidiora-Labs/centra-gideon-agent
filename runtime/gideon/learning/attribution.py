"""Predict-then-verify, wired: the curator grades what a human accepted (LEARN-R16 / §3.1 — S77).

`accountability.py` is the pure half — given before/after failure rates and what a change PREDICTED
it would fix, it returns the five-way verdict and decides whether a revert is owed. It was written
with zero production importers on purpose: the orchestration that reads the Run Ledger, persists a
record across the accept→observe→grade gap, and files the revert lives HERE, so accountability stays
a pure, source-scannable module (S77's `test_a_revert_is_a_PROPOSAL_never_an_application` asserts it
contains no `sqlite3`/`atomic_write`/`accept(`/`installer`).

This module is that orchestration, and it is what makes criterion 9 real. Two halves join over time:

**At accept-time — snapshot the bet.** `proposals.accept` DELETES the proposal file (only a
fingerprint-keyed `Decision` survives, with no manifest and no target), so the moment a human
accepts is the only moment the change's `predicted_fixes`, its `target`, and the failure rates
BEFORE it landed are still knowable. :func:`record_accepted_change` freezes exactly that into a
durable record. The baseline is keyed by run id, not timestamp: the two stores stamp time in
different formats, and a set difference over run ids is exact where a string compare across formats
is a bug in waiting.

**On the curator tick — grade it.** :func:`grade_accepted_changes` finds records with ≥N
post-acceptance runs of their target template, recomputes the failure rates over ONLY those new
runs, calls `accountability.attribute`, records the verdict, and — for a HARMFUL verdict — files a
revert PROPOSAL through the shared human-gated queue. It never applies anything; "mechanical" in
§3.1 means the revert appears in the queue without the user having to notice the regression, not
that it rolls back on its own, and S75's gate refuses a non-human accept regardless.

**Cluster = failure MODE, scope = the target's runs.** The join between what a proposer PREDICTED
and what the ledger MEASURED needs a shared vocabulary. Free-form prediction strings and per-run
signatures do not share one; the closed `FailureMode` enum does — a refiner says "this fixes
`schema_violation` failures" and the ledger's per-mode rate is directly comparable. Rates are scoped
to runs whose `workflow_name` equals the change's `target`, so a HARMFUL verdict means "this
template's runs got worse", not "something somewhere regressed after an unrelated accept". A target
matching no template has an empty scope and can only ever resolve INEFFECTIVE — the safe default,
never a spurious revert.
