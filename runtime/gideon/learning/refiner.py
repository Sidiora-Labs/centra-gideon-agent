"""Run outcomes → template refinement: the acceptance discipline (LEARN-R2 / §3.1 — S73).

The flagship spoke, and the one with the most ways to go wrong. An optimizer that edits templates
from
run outcomes random-walks them under judge noise unless acceptance is strict, so §3.1's
"acceptance discipline" section is longer than its mechanism section — and this module is the
discipline, expressed as pure decisions the refiner pipeline applies.

The four gates, each with the failure it prevents:

* **Failure clustering first, LLM second.** A zero-cost pass over the Run Ledger groups failures by
  shared mechanism and ranks them by frequency × unresolvedness. The refiner proposes against the
  TOP cluster only. Without it, an LLM reads a hundred unrelated failures and proposes something
  plausible about none of them.
* **Median of 3 critic runs, with an epsilon margin.** §3.1 is blunt: single-run acceptance is
  provably indistinguishable from noise". The median of three is what makes a score a measurement.
* **Held-out replay (GateOK).** An accepted edit must IMPROVE its target and may regress every
  other cluster by at most epsilon. An edit that fixes one failure by breaking two is a regression
  that looks like progress on the metric it was written against.
* **The frozen region.** The refiner may touch prompts, retries, and gates. It may NEVER touch the
  template id, its triggers, or its surfacing metadata — those decide WHEN a template runs, and a
  self-editing system that can change its own trigger conditions is one whose behaviour drifts
  without anyone approving the drift.

**Measured before writing.** Every prerequisite is in place: `journal.LEDGER_KINDS` carries all
five events the refiner reads (`step_completed`/`step_failed`/`step_skipped`/`gate_resolved`/
`run_abandoned`) plus `user_edited_mid_flight` — the "gold" signal §3.1 names, because a repeated
identical hand-fix is a user telling you what the template should have said. And `mutations.OpKind`
is a
CLOSED vocabulary of ten ops, so a diff is expressed in the engine's own terms rather than a second
edit language that would need its own validator.

Pure functions. Nothing here calls a model, writes a template, or files a proposal — the pipeline
does that, and keeping the decisions separable is what makes them testable without a judge in the
loop.
