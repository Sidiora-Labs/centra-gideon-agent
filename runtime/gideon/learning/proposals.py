"""One proposal queue for every kind of autonomous synthesis.

**The invariant this module exists to enforce: autonomous synthesis PROPOSES; the
human installs.** It is the flywheel's trust anchor — the system may notice
anything, and change nothing on its own.

Generalized from `skills/proposals.py`, which held exactly this shape for one kind
(synthesized skills). Six kinds now share it, because they share the property that
matters: each is a durable change to how the system will behave, inferred from
evidence rather than instructed.

## Why a queue rather than direct writes

The per-kind write policy is deliberate, not uniform:

- **Direct write** for facets, voice aspects, procedural priors, episodic/semantic
  memory. Reversible, decaying, low blast radius — a queue would cost more attention
  than the change is worth.
- **Direct write** for a lesson from an *explicit user correction*: the user just
  said it, so asking them to confirm it is noise.
- **Proposal** for a lesson *inferred* from consolidation or a run failure. This is a
  change from prior behaviour, where consolidation lessons wrote live — and it
  closes a real hole: a prompt injection that reached a transcript could otherwise
  become a standing instruction with no human in the loop.
- **Proposal, always** for skills, templates, and template diffs. These execute.

## Decision memory — the anti-nag machinery

A proposer that re-files a rejected suggestion trains the user to ignore the queue,
which destroys the queue's value faster than a wrong proposal does. So every
proposal carries a content fingerprint, and every proposer consults the decision
store *before* filing:

- a fingerprint matching a prior ACCEPTED or REJECTED decision is silently skipped;
- an exact duplicate of something PENDING **reinforces** it (a counter and a fresh
  timestamp) rather than inserting a second row;
- a rejected proposal is kept as a negative exemplar, with escalating cooldowns,
  because "no" is information worth keeping.

The resolve cascade (`resolve`) is the deterministic pre-LLM triage that decides
which of those four things is happening. It runs contradiction detection BEFORE the
reinforce shortcut, because near-identical text with opposite polarity ("always use
X" vs "never use X") must REPLACE, not reinforce — reinforcing it would average two
opposite instructions into one confident wrong one.

    The three ``project_*`` kinds (LEA-12) are the review's typed output: a self-updating
    project context that PROPOSES rather than writes, so a run's learnings reach the
    project's overview/ledger/inlined-file/skill only through the same human gate every
    other kind clears.

    ``KNOWLEDGE_DRAFT`` (KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §3.3/§3.4, WF2KNO-8) is the same bargain for
    the knowledge store: a gap-healing or schema-edit draft reaches
    ``workspace/knowledge`` only after a human accepts it. Before this kind existed the
    gap-healing template had no way to file one — ``enqueue`` SKIPS an unlisted kind and
    logs at debug — so the template wrote a TTL'd probe straight into the store instead,
    which is the self-citation anti-pattern the template's own doctrine warns about.

    ``PROMPT`` and ``AGENT`` (AGENT-PACKS §4.3, AP-4) are the prompt-card importer's other two
