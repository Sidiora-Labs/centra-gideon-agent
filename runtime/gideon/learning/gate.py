"""The LearningGate — one eligibility answer per event, consumed by every cadence.

Before this module, eligibility was computed independently at three sites and
*skipped entirely* at a fourth:

- ``chat_runner`` recomputed ``should_review(...)`` for the memory review and
  again for the skill-ladder review — same six arguments, two call sites, two
  chances to drift;
- preference-facet capture ran with **no** eligibility check beyond the ephemeral
  flag, deliberately, so a cheap heuristic wouldn't be suppressed by an
  expensive-review threshold;
- the incognito/temporary suppression came from a process-global registry
  consulted at whichever sites remembered to consult it.

Each of those was locally defensible. Together they mean "is this session allowed
to teach the system anything?" had no single answer — and the run-end cadence
would have made a fourth.

The gate separates the two questions those sites had conflated:

**Permission** (may this event teach us anything at all?) is a property of the
*session*: learning enabled, not ephemeral, not incognito/temporary. It is
identical for every cadence, and a denial suppresses everything downstream.

**Worthwhileness** (is this event worth paying an LLM for?) is a property of the
*turn*, and legitimately differs per cadence: a free heuristic runs on every
permitted turn, an expensive review waits for a correction or real tool work.

Conflating them is what produced the facet-capture carve-out. Splitting them
keeps the carve-out's *intent* — cheap capture on every turn — while routing it
through one gate, so incognito suppression can never again be a site that
someone forgot to add.
