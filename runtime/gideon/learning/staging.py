"""The staging tier — an append-only capture log with explicit outcome records.

Two problems this solves, both learned from real failures.

**Silent capture failure.** A capture pass that reads the wrong transcript, or
throws inside a best-effort ``except``, produces exactly what a working pass
produces on a quiet day: nothing. That class of bug survived a long time here
precisely because its symptom is indistinguishable from correct operation. So
every pass persists an outcome — ``FLUSH_OK`` (ran, nothing worth proposing),
``FLUSH_ERROR`` (ran, broke, with the type and message), or the proposal ids it
produced. Absence of output stops being invisible: a week of nothing on an active
system is now a *reportable* state rather than a silence nobody can distinguish
from health.

**Cheap-vs-expensive coupling.** Extraction has to be cheap enough to run on every
turn; consolidation is expensive enough that it must batch. Writing them as one
pass forces a choice between paying too often and losing signal. Staging splits
them: extraction appends raw entries immediately, and the expensive pass runs
later over the accumulation, gated by activity + a time window + input-hash
idempotence — no new daemon, it piggybacks on cadences that already fire.

**Append-only.** Consolidation never edits staging entries; it reads them and
writes elsewhere. Compiled proposals keep ``sources`` pointers back, so a
surprising proposal can be traced to the turns that produced it. If consolidation
could rewrite its own inputs, that audit trail would describe the conclusion
rather than the evidence.

Storage is ``learning.db`` beside ``memory.db`` — a separate file because staging
is high-volume, low-value, and independently prunable, and because a corrupt
capture log must never take semantic memory down with it.
