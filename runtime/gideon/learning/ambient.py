"""The ambient render, put under ONE budget (§2.4 / §7 crit 5 — S80).

§7's criterion 5: "the lesson block, skill INDEX, template suggestion, voice/facet blocks, and
self-model snapshot fit ONE per-turn slot-allocated token budget; lessons are never crowded out
(sacrificial-slot truncation only); the authority preamble renders."

S71 built the allocator (`learning/surfacing.py`) and deliberately stopped short of owning the
render, recording why: "replacing the whole render is behaviour-visible and needs §2.5's measurement
floor to prove nothing stops surfacing." That floor landed in S71's own measure module. This is the
adapter that finally routes the named blocks through it.

**Measured before writing — three inert controls, not one.**

1. `allocate()` and `AUTHORITY_PREAMBLE` had ZERO callers outside their own module and tests.
   The ranking algorithm existed; nothing ranked.
2. `learning.context_budget_tokens` is a fully round-tripped config knob (dataclass + `_meta` +
   `load()` + `to_dict()` + `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`) that NOTHING read. Its help text promises "only
   retrieved context is ever trimmed" — a promise no code kept.
3. The blocks were bounded by per-block CHARACTER caps that sum to ~36,750 tokens against a declared
   4,000-token budget — 9x. Driven with 120 realistic lessons the render passes the budget by 1,576
   tokens; at 400+ it reaches 10,101 tokens, 2.5x, with no joint check anywhere. On the same
   input the allocator holds 3,999 and keeps the query-relevant lesson.

**Two measurements that decided the design.**

**The budget must scale with the model window.** `context._memory_caps` scales its sections by
`window/200k` clamped to [1,5], so at 1M the memory sections get 5x more room. A FLAT budget
next to that silently inverts the plan's own adaptive-recall design: the ambient blocks would be the
only thing that does not grow. `budget_for_window` applies the SAME multiple, so the two halves of
the prompt scale together.

**The skill INDEX is a catalogue, not a candidate set.** Fed as one candidate per entry, the
diversification cap (`MAX_PER_SOURCE = 3`) kept 3 of 12 skills while 3,539 tokens sat unused — it
would HIDE most of the user's skills to enforce source diversity on a block whose whole purpose is
completeness. So the index is ONE candidate with the plan's three-step degradation (full →
hint-capped descriptions → names only), which is also why it can shrink instead of vanishing.

**🔴 The skills block holds TWO populations, and the first version dropped one.** Caught by the
EXISTING suite (`test_context.py::test_skills_injected`), not by anything written here: an
always-loaded skill renders as `### Skill: <name>` plus its full body, while on-demand skills render
as the `- **name**: …` index. An index-only parser silently dropped every always-loaded skill — the
ones the user marked never-optional. `always_body` and `index_candidate` are now a pair, each with
its own `[Skills:]` frame (either can be dropped independently, so one shared wrapper would
sometimes frame nothing), and the bodies rank above the index because a pointer list should yield
before content does.

**Scope is the five blocks the criterion names**, not the whole eight-part assembly. The memory
context keeps `_memory_caps` — it is a different, already-window-scaled mechanism, and swapping a
working recall render for an unproven one is what S71 refused to do blind. Two of the five have no
producer yet (see `SLOT_KINDS`); their slot mapping is asserted so a future producer joins it
instead of appending beside it.
