"""Predict-then-verify: did an accepted change actually help? (LEARN-R16 / §3.1 — S77).

The last spoke, and the one that closes the loop. Everything upstream files proposals; this measures
what happened AFTER a human accepted one — and files a revert when the answer is "it made things
worse".

§3.1's rule is predict-then-verify, which is stronger than measure-after: an accepted proposal
DECLARED which failures it would fix (`predicted_fixes` on the change manifest), so the verdict can
compare prediction against outcome rather than just looking at a delta and inventing a story.

That comparison produces the class §3.1 calls the scariest: **`unattributed_regressions`** — things
that broke which nobody predicted. A change scored only on its own predictions looks fine while
having broken something adjacent, and that is exactly the failure a five-way verdict exists to
catch.

**Measured before writing.** `refiner.canary_verdict` (S73) already returns the five verdict names
from a scalar before/after, so this module does NOT re-derive them — it reuses that function and
adds
the per-cluster attribution it cannot see from one number. And `learning/gate.py`'s permission gate
is
genuinely closed: probed across all three cadences, a restricted (incognito) session is refused
whatever the tool count or correction signal. What is NOT closed is coverage — `Cadence.SESSION_END`
and `Cadence.RUN_END` are declared and have ZERO live callers, so the gate cannot suppress a path
nobody routes through it. `assert_gate_covers_cadences` makes that a checkable fact rather than a
comment.

Pure functions. Filing the revert is the caller's; this decides that one is owed.
