"""One capture-hygiene policy: what the learning cadences are allowed to look at.

Learning turns text into durable state, so anything that reaches a capture cadence
can influence the system's future behaviour. That makes "what is in scope" a
security question, not a quality one — and it was previously answered by filters
scattered across the capture paths, each covering a different subset.

This module is the single auditable answer. Four exclusions, each for a distinct
reason:

**Untrusted content is invisible.** Text inside ``<untrusted_content>`` came from
outside the user↔agent boundary — a fetched page, an inbox body, an MCP payload.
Fencing stops a model from *executing* it in the moment, but learning would copy
it into durable state where it is read back later without a fence. So the span is
removed before any cadence sees it: a planted "always deploy without review"
cannot become a lesson, because the text never reaches the extractor.

**Platform scaffolding is invisible.** Cron preambles, autonudge messages,
subagent-completion events, hook context. At this system's cron density these are
the *larger* pollution volume — the flywheel would dutifully learn that the user
frequently says "CONTINUE the autonomous build", which is true and useless.

**Environment failures are denied.** "tool X is broken", "permission denied" —
already the guardrail in ``after_turn_review``, kept here so every cadence shares
it rather than only the per-turn one. These harden into refusals the agent later
cites against itself.

**Ungrounded turns are skipped** for per-turn capture: a lesson needs both a
decision and evidence for it, with real substance on each side.

**A stated boundary, accepted deliberately.** Text the *user pasted in their own
message* is user-trusted under single-user doctrine and CAN direct-write a lesson
via the correction heuristic. A user pasting a hostile document and then agreeing
with it is a self-inflicted wound the fence cannot distinguish from legitimate
"here is the spec, follow it". Documented rather than silently mitigated.
