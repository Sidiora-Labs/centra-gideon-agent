"""The capped self-model — reinforcement-promoted, propose-don't-write (LEARN-R21 / §2.6 — S72).

The flywheel's ONLY mechanism that learns from what quietly WORKS. Every other cadence learns from
corrections and failures, which means the system can only ever discover what it did wrong; this one
notices a habit that keeps succeeding and offers to make it a principle.

That asymmetry is also what makes it dangerous, so §2.6 constrains it three ways and this module
enforces all three mechanically rather than by convention:

1. **Propose, never install.** A crossed threshold produces a PROPOSAL in the unified queue, exactly
   like a lesson. Nothing here writes a principle into memory. A system that promotes its own
   behavioural rules is a system whose behaviour the user cannot predict, and the plan says "never
   self-installed" for that reason.
2. **Bounded by construction.** ~6 active principles, ~4 working theories, ~4 current-focus entries,
   a small retrospection ring. Promotion into a FULL cap requires DISPLACING an existing entry, so
   bloat is impossible at the schema level rather than policed by a later cleanup that may not run.
3. **Only a compact snapshot injects.** One budgeted slot in §2.4's allocator, never the history.

**Measured before writing.** `user.selfmodel.*` was NOT in `_NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE`, so a principle
the harness observed about its own working patterns would have rendered as a FACT ABOUT THE USER — a
category error and a leak. The exclusion landed with this session. `user.*` was already in
`_BUILTIN_PREFIXES`, so no allowlist change was needed; measuring both saved inventing one.

Pure decisions over records. The observer's writes go through `MemoryService`, and the proposals go
through `learning.proposals` — this module builds neither store.
