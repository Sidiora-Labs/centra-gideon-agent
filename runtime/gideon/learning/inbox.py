"""The Proposal Inbox: one surface for six kinds, and the accept gate (§6.1 / §7 — S75).

§7's criterion 1 has two halves: one inbox shows all six proposal kinds with provenance, evidence
manifests, and risk-tier metadata — **and the model cannot accept its own proposals under any trust
mode**. The second half is the load-bearing one, and this module is where it becomes a control
rather than a coincidence.

**Measured before writing.** `learning/proposals.accept()` takes `(pid, installer=...)` and NOTHING
in it knows WHO is accepting: no actor, no caller, no trust check. The invariant held only because
no agent tool happened to call it — an ABSENCE, not a control. Add one MCP tool next month and it is
gone, silently, with no test failing. `require_human` is the gate; `test_an_agent_can_never_accept`
is the regression.

The rest of the module is the inbox's own discipline:

* **Six kinds, one queue.** `proposals.Kind` already has exactly six, so this reuses them rather
than
  minting a parallel vocabulary — a second kind list is how a surface silently stops showing one.
* **Risk tier is METADATA, never a lane.** §3.1 is explicit: any "auto" tier is guardrail-violating.
  Tiers order and filter the queue; they never decide.
* **`manifest_valid=false` surfaces, never rejects.** §3.1's validation is lenient-but-recording: a
  proposal with a broken manifest is still reviewable, flagged, because dropping it would hide a
  refiner bug behind an empty inbox.
* **Provenance is required to render a row.** A proposal whose source cannot be shown is one a
  reviewer cannot weigh, and an unweighable row trains people to bulk-accept.

Pure decisions and view models. The store stays in `learning.proposals`; nothing here writes.
