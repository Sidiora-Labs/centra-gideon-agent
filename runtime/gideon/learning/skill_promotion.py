"""Retroactive promotion — what already WORKED becomes a skill PROPOSAL (LEARN E1.3 — WF2LEA-11).

The pieces around this already existed, which is why this module is small:

* ``skill_remember`` captures a skill at the moment the user TEACHES one — a session-live
  ephemeral draft (`skills/ephemeral.py`) the end-of-chat prompt persists or forgets. Prompted,
  in-the-moment, and it already never writes a live skill on its own.
* ``learning.proposals`` owns the one human-gated queue (§2.2), with the content fingerprint and
  the prior-decision block that make a declined suggestion stay declined.
* §3.2 already mines finished runs — but for *templates*: ``mining.positive_path_candidates`` →
  ``mining.file_positive_trace`` files recurring successful step sequences as ``Kind.TEMPLATE``.

The gap is the skill half of that last one: nothing turned a completed run or conversation into a
skill. ``Kind.SKILL`` was declared for exactly this and had **no writer** — the inbox even carries
its label ("New skill proposed") — so what this module does is fill the reserved slot in the queue
that already exists. No second queue and no new store: filing goes through ``proposals.enqueue``,
and installing goes through ``SkillsLoader.create_auto_skill``, the same rail every autonomously
authored skill has always been written by.

**Propose, never write.** Promotion produces a PENDING row and nothing else — no skill directory,
no ``SKILL.md``. The write lives in :func:`install_accepted_skill`, which ``proposals.accept`` runs
only after ``require_human``, so the agent that proposed a skill cannot be the actor that installs
it. That asymmetry is the whole point of the retroactive path: mining what worked is cheap and
often wrong, and a cheap wrong suggestion is only safe if a person stands between it and the
library.

**Deterministic, no model here.** The agent has the run or the conversation in context and names
the candidate; this module VALIDATES and ROUTES it. Same stance as ``project_context_review``: no
LLM at promotion time, so the path stays off the degraded-LLM surface map and a promotion is a pure
function of its inputs plus the run's recorded status.

**Unprompted is the same call.** An agent that noticed it re-derived a procedure may promote it
without being asked, because the outcome is identical either way — one reviewable row. Provenance
is stamped ``inferred`` regardless of who initiated it: an agent's report that the user asked is
not evidence that the user asked, and ``inferred`` is the conservative label (it decays faster and
scores below a real human correction).

**Decision memory is reused, not reinvented.** ``proposals.enqueue`` fingerprints (kind, target,
body) and returns ``SKIP`` when a prior decision ACCEPTED or REJECTED that fingerprint. So a
promotion the user rejected does not come back on the next run of the same procedure — clause 3 of
the contract is the queue's existing machinery, wired through rather than rebuilt.
