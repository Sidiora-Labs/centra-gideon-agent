"""Lesson confidence — one derivation, one gate, one precedence rule.

Before this module a lesson was injected at full strength the moment it was
written. A rule observed once by an inference pass and a rule the user has taught
and re-taught a hundred times entered the prompt identically, because the only
question anyone asked was *does a row exist*. Existence is not evidence, and a
prompt built on existence cannot answer either half of what a user actually asks:
"why is it still doing that" or "why did it stop doing that".

**Confidence is DERIVED, never assigned.** Nothing writes a confidence number.
:func:`derive` reads an evidence record — how many times the lesson was observed,
how recently, how often it was contradicted, whether a correction reversed it —
and computes the value fresh. `semantic_memory.confidence` (``1.0`` for
``user_explicit``, ``0.9`` otherwise) is a *source constant* used for write
conflict resolution and is deliberately NOT this number: it says who wrote the
row, not how well the row is supported.

**Retained-but-not-injected is a declared state, not deletion.** A lesson below
the gate stays in the store, keeps accumulating observations, and is reported as
:attr:`LessonStanding.RETAINED`. Discarding weak signal destroys exactly the
evidence that would later make it strong — the second time a rule is observed is
only meaningful because the first was kept.

**The precedence rule (stated ONCE — cite this docstring, do not restate it).**
When evidence both supports and refutes a lesson, refutation wins, in this order:

1. **A REVERSAL voids every observation that preceded it.** Corroboration counts
   only observations recorded *after* the last reversal, so a lesson the user
   un-taught must earn its evidence again from scratch rather than returning at
   the strength it held before.
2. **Each CONTRADICTION cancels one surviving observation** before the
   corroboration curve is read. A lesson observed three times and contradicted
   twice therefore stands exactly where a once-observed lesson stands, and never
   above it.
3. **Only then** do corroboration and recency multiply into a confidence.

The consequence is the property the atom asks for: a lesson can never be injected
alongside its own refutation, because refutation is *subtracted from* the
evidence rather than scored beside it.

**Why an OBSERVATION count and not a usage count.** ``learning.usage`` exempts
lessons from the usage store on purpose — a lesson renders as an always-on block,
so "surfaced" degenerates into "a session happened" and measures how much the
user talks. That exemption is not a claim that lessons have no evidence axis; it
names the wrong one. The right axis is the *capture* side: every time the world
produces this rule again, that is one observation, and the dedup path that used
to drop a repeat silently was throwing that signal away.

**Recency rides the ONE decay kernel.** :mod:`gideon.learning.decay` is the
single answer to "is this still relevant?", and a second private curve here would
be the third-implementation defect that module was written to end. Human-authored
lessons ride it at ``importance=1.0`` — five times slower, still not never, which
is that module's own "importance is an axis, not an exemption" doctrine rather
than a carve-out invented here.
