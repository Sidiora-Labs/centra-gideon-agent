"""LEARN-R4's `surfacing_events` log — one row per candidate the surfacing engine offered.

**This table was NAMED before it existed.** `measure.per_arm_precision` was written to consume
it, `evals/retrieval_bench.py` documented mining it and shipped a SUBSTITUTE instead, and
`dashboard/handlers/learning.py` explained in prose why it could not read it — three consumers
referring to a table with "no schema, no reader, no writer". `WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL`
§2.5 (S71) recorded the gap precisely: *"NOT DONE (by scope): the `surfacing_events` TABLE and
its 90d prune on the curator tick."* This module is that table.

**What one row means.** A candidate ENTERED the allocator for one turn — it was offered, with a
named match arm and the score it competed on — and either its content reached the prompt or it
did not. That second fact is the `used` column, and §2.5 is emphatic about where it may come
from: *"'Used' is derived MECHANICALLY — skill body loaded after surfacing, template run started
from a suggestion, run outcome success/failure, lesson referenced by after_turn_review — never a
voluntary model feedback call (unenforced 'helpful' scores stay ornamental forever)."* So this
store has no API for recording an opinion. `used` is a fact the writer observed, or it is False.

**Every column earns its place from a real reader**, because a speculative wide table is worse
than a narrow correct one:

| Column | Read by |
|---|---|
| `kind`, `arm`, `used` | `measure.per_arm_precision` — the keys it destructures, exactly |
| `entity` | the retrieval benchmark's weak labels: the id a positive label points AT |
| `query` | the same: `mine_knowledge_qrels` needs the text the retrieval answered |
| `confidence` | `measure.propose_thresholds` — tuning 0.55/0.62 needs the scores actually seen |
| `session` | self-similar dedup (§2.5): ten retrievals in one session are one act of attention |
| `created_ts` | the 90d prune |

**Storage rides `learning.db`**, the one file §2.5 assigns the flywheel's lifecycle tables, and
declares its own table lazily with `IF NOT EXISTS` — the same shape `usage.UsageStore` uses over
the same connection. That idempotent declaration IS the migration story here; this project ships
no migration machinery and is not getting any.
