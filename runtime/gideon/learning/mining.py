"""The PRODUCERS behind §3.2's detectors — embeddings, intent inversion, positive-path traces.

``learning.detectors`` holds pure verdicts and is deliberately fed from outside. Three of its
inputs had no producer at all, which is a specific and nasty failure shape: the detector is written,
tested, and reachable, but the argument it needs is never computed, so it can only ever return the
"nothing to see" branch. `similarity_verdict` is the clearest case — it consumes
``matches: list[tuple[run_id, cosine, age_days]]`` and nothing in the tree built that list, so "you
have built this three times" could not fire however many times you built it.

This module is the producer side, and only that:

* :func:`similar_run_matches` — embed a run's plan/spec through the EXISTING embedding substrate
  (``vector_memory`` via ``MemoryService``) and return the triples ``similarity_verdict`` wants.
* :func:`invert_intent` — the §3.2 intent-inversion pass: what the user ASKED for versus what the
  run actually DID, derived from the run's own journal.
* :func:`positive_path_candidates` — §3.2's positive half: recurring SUCCESSFUL step sequences mined
  from the Run Ledger, routed to the same PENDING proposal path the negative signals use.

**A registry miss is a typed reason, never an empty list.** The reason `similarity_verdict` was safe
to leave unwired is also what makes wiring it dangerous: "no similar plans" and "I could not embed
anything, so I looked at nothing" produce the identical verdict. The first is a calibrated detector;
the second is a blind one wearing its clothes. Every path that cannot resolve an embedding returns a
:class:`Miss` reason and records it, so a box with no embedder reads as UNAVAILABLE rather than as a
library with no repetition in it.

Nothing here installs. The proposal paths file PENDING rows through ``learning.proposals.enqueue``,
the same human gate every other inferred artifact clears.
