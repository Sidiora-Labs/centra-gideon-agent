"""Consumer liveness — is anybody reading what this work unit produces? (PP-10)

Every watchdog in this repo measures PRODUCER health: findings count, turn wall-time, stagnation,
consecutive errors. Nothing asks whether the output was ever READ. The field post-mortem
`PLATFORM-PRIMITIVES` §3 is drawn from is a fully autonomous pipeline that had been dead for two
months with nobody noticing, and its author's diagnosis was structural rather than tooling: nobody
owned acting on the output. Our equivalent is a monitor-kind run writing a deliverable on a cadence
into an artifact nobody opens — we detect a STALLED work unit and never a POINTLESS one.

**A PROPOSAL, never an automatic stop.** Nothing in this module can pause, cancel, retire or
otherwise touch a run, a template or a schedule. It files one `retirement` proposal through the
shared human-gated queue and stops, because *"nobody looked yet"* and *"nobody will ever look"* are
different facts and only the user knows which. A sweep that paused the work unit itself would be
confidently wrong exactly in the case that matters — the deliverable somebody reads quarterly.

**It reads `PP-9`'s outcome record; it counts nothing of its own.** A `publish:` node already
opens a `pending_outcome{producer: publish, metric: artifact.<slug>.consumed, horizon_secs: 7d,
baseline: 1.0, slug}` at publish time (`workflows/engine._open_publish_outcome`). That record IS the
consumption horizon. This module supplies the two halves `PP-9` left open:

1. :func:`measure_consumption` — the ground truth for a :data:`~gideon.ledger.outcomes.
   SOURCE_CONSUMPTION` question, so the ONE resolver grades a publish bet as `measured` 1.0/0.0
   instead of always `inconclusive`;
2. :func:`sweep` — the dormancy projection over those resolutions, grouped by work unit.

There is no second counter and no parallel store. The sweep is STATELESS: it re-derives its verdict
from the ledger each tick, and its idempotency comes from the proposal queue's own fingerprint plus
decision memory, not from a file it writes.

## What counts as a consumer touch

A touch is recorded by a writer that ALREADY EXISTS, on the artifact rather than in the run:

* an artifact lifecycle event of type `referenced`, `edited` or `reverted` whose actor is not
  `agent`. `referenced` is written by `record_impression` from two live surfaces — the dashboard's
  `POST /api/artifacts/{slug}/events` when the user opens the artifact, and `chat_runner` when the
  user pulls the artifact into a turn. `edited`/`reverted` are the user changing it, which is a
  stronger read than opening it;
* the slug appearing in the dashboard pin list (`workflows/pinned.py`, `entity_settings/
  pinned_artifacts.json`) — "I care about this now", the most explicit touch there is.

`created` and `iterated` are deliberately EXCLUDED: those are the producer writing its own output,
and counting them would make every work unit look consumed by itself — the exact tautology that
makes a liveness signal worthless.

**Known blind spot, recorded rather than papered over.** `NativeArtifactProvider.update()` appends a
timeline event only on the `snapshot=True` branch, and the API route defaults `snapshot` to False —
so an un-versioned content edit leaves NO trace and is invisible here. That is the existing writer's
behaviour; widening it means changing artifact event semantics for every consumer of the timeline,
which is a separate change. The consequence is conservative in the right direction: a missed touch
can only make the sweep report a work unit somebody is quietly using, which the user then rejects
once and never sees again — not the reverse.

## Why it cannot become a blanket nag

Measured on this tree: **0 of the 19 bundled templates declare a `publish:` node**, so on a fresh or
seeded install the population that can fire is EMPTY. Firing requires a user-authored work unit that
publishes, runs at least :data:`~gideon.ledger.outcomes.DORMANCY_CYCLES` times, and whose
every recent artifact sat untouched past its 7-day horizon. Three further guards:

* an `inconclusive` cycle (artifact deleted, timeline unreadable) yields `INSUFFICIENT`, never
  `DORMANT` — "we could not tell" does not accumulate into "nobody reads this";
* one touch anywhere in the window is `LIVE` and the sweep says nothing;
* the proposal BODY is stable per work unit (the volatile slugs live in `evidence_refs`, which is
  outside the fingerprint), so a re-file REINFORCES the existing row instead of stacking a new one,
  and a rejection lands in decision memory keyed to that same fingerprint and blocks the re-file
  outright. Not nagging is the feature.
