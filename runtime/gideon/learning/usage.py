"""One usage store, with per-entity semantics — what got surfaced, and what got used.

Usage lived in `<skills_dir>/.usage.json`, a JSON sidecar. That was a skills-ism:
it works for one entity type in one directory, and templates/lessons have neither.
This moves it into `learning.db` beside the staging log.

**Per-entity semantics, because a naive shared store degenerates.** The recorded
events differ by what the entity's lifecycle actually depends on:

| Entity | Events | Why |
|---|---|---|
| skill | surfaced, loaded | surfacing is cheap, loading is the real signal |
| template | surfaced, run, outcome | one that runs and FAILS is worse than one never run |
| lesson | **EXEMPT** | see below |

**Lessons are deliberately exempt.** They render as always-on, caps-bounded blocks,
so "surfaced" degenerates to "a session happened" — a counter that only measures
how much the user talks. Their lifecycle signal is the contradiction judge, capsule
replay, and explicit forget. Recording usage for them would produce a number that
looks like evidence and means nothing, which is worse than having no number.

**Reinforcement flushes once per session, not per retrieval.** Ten retrievals in
one turn is one act of attention. Counting each one inflates heat until every
comparison against it is distorted — and heat feeds eviction decisions, so the
inflation ends up deleting the wrong things.
