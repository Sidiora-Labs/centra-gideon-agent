"""The hardened curator — ages and reviews learned entities, and can always be undone.

`skills/curator.py` did this for one entity type with one invariant list. Generalizing
it means adding the guards that a single-type, aging-only pass never needed, because
the failure modes of an automated janitor are not the failure modes of an automated
author:

**Demote, never delete.** Every mutation is WAL-logged with its before/after, so any
pass can be undone. The maximum destructive action is archival, and archival is
reversible. This extends the reversible-event WAL that `vector_memory` already uses.

**Provenance scoping.** Every entity carries `source_type` (user | agent | run). The
curator may age, consolidate, or patch **agent-created entities only**. Deleting what
the user wrote is not curation; it is data loss with a tidy justification.

**Over-deletion refusal.** A pass that would cut more than half of a non-trivial set
is refused outright rather than executed. The realistic cause of such a pass is a bug
in the pass — a mis-parsed timestamp, an empty usage table read as "nothing is used" —
and the honest response to "I am about to delete most of your library" is to stop.

**Bounded batches, oldest-audited first.** ~8 entities per tick. An unbounded curator
tick is a latency spike attached to whatever cadence hosts it, and the work is never
urgent enough to justify one.

**Decayed-but-stable becomes a REVIEW proposal,** not a silent archival. Something the
system is confident about that nobody uses is a question for the user, and the
confidence is itself the evidence that they may want it back.

**Scheduling, corrected.** `skills/curator.run_aging` had no verified scheduled caller
— it existed and nothing ran it. This is wired into the consolidation maintenance
cadence in `history.py`, which is a real, verified tick. No new scheduler: a new
daemon for janitorial work is a new thing to monitor and a new thing to fail silently.
