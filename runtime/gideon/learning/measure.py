"""Is the flywheel working? Per-arm precision + Beta-Binomial trust (LEARN-R4 / §2.5 — S71).

§7's criterion 7 is the bar: per-arm surfaced-vs-used precision is REPORTABLE per entity kind,
threshold profiles are TUNABLE FROM DATA, and a muted chip visibly LOWERS an entity's trust
posterior. All three are measurements, not opinions, and the plan is explicit about why:
"unenforced 'helpful' scores stay ornamental forever".

**Measured before writing.** `learning/surfacing.py` already carries `THRESHOLD_PROFILES` with the
0.55/0.62 split the plan wants preserved, and `learning/usage.py` already persists
`surfaced`/`used`/`successes`/`failures` per entity — the exact counts a posterior needs. What is
missing is the middle: `Candidate` has no `arm` field, so nothing can attribute a surfacing to the
match path that produced it, and nothing computes a posterior from the counts that exist.

So this module adds the attribution and the statistics, and deliberately does NOT add a second
threshold table or a second usage store.

**Why per-arm and not one scalar.** §2.5: "a single scalar can't be calibrated per-arm". An
exact-name match and an embedding match that both score 0.7 are not equally trustworthy, and
averaging them produces a threshold too permissive for one and too strict for the other. Precision
is therefore reported per `(kind, arm)` pair — the unit a threshold can actually be tuned on.

**Why Beta-Binomial and not a ratio.** A raw used/surfaced ratio says 1.0 after a single lucky hit
and 0.0 after a single miss — so a brand-new entity outranks a proven one, and one bad turn
condemns a good lesson. The Beta posterior encodes "we have barely any evidence" as a wide interval
around the prior, which is what makes the tie-break honest. `LOWER_BOUND_Z` shrinks toward the
prior in proportion to ignorance; ranking on it is what stops a 1-for-1 entity leading the board.
