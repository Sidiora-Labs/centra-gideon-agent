"""The loop-end learner — a terminal loop run mines its own ledger for lessons (PP-5).

The loop-engine sibling of :mod:`gideon.learning.run_end`. Before PP-5 the flywheel's §3.2
producers ran only over workflow runs, because a loop's findings/verdicts lived in a file store with
no event vocabulary — `learning.mining` derives from *"the run's own journal"*, and a loop had none.
Now that loop cycles emit `step_started`/`step_completed`/`judge_verdict`/`breaker_trip`/
`watcher_reaped` to the ledger, a loop run is mineable through exactly the reader a workflow run is.

This module supplies the two adapters `learning.mining` needs to treat a loop as a "run":

* :class:`_LoopRunView` — a :class:`~gideon.loop.loop.Loop` presented in the run-shape mining
  reads (`id`/`intent`/`workflow_name`/`status`/`project_id`/`origin`).
* :class:`_LoopRunStore` — a `list_runs(workflow_name=, limit=)` over the loop store, so
  `positive_path_candidates` clusters recurring loop paths.

Mirrors run_end's two rules: inert similarity/index unless a live vector store is injected, and
PROPOSE-never-install (every draft clears `learning.proposals.enqueue`, the shared human gate).
