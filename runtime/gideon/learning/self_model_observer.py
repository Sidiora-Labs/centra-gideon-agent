"""The self-model observer — the call site S72 deliberately left unbuilt (LEARN-R21 / §2.6 — LEA-8).

`learning/self_model.py` shipped the pure decisions (reinforcement, caps, promotion, the snapshot)
and recorded that it builds no store: "The observer's writes go through `MemoryService`, and the
proposals go through `learning.proposals`." This module is that observer. It is the ONLY writer of
the `user.selfmodel.*` rows `self_model.snapshot()` reads, so the two halves stop being inert.

**The reaction is only knowable one turn later — so it is measured, never guessed.** `Reaction`
names the signal "something the user DID"; the module's own `Observation.evidence` refuses to read
tool-success as acceptance. The one honest positive signal is the user *moving on to the next
step* — a subsequent non-correction turn — and the one honest negative is a subsequent correction.
Neither is visible at the end of the turn judged. So each turn's `(route, tools, outcome)` is
PARKED, and the FOLLOWING turn's correction-signal resolves it to an `ACCEPTED`/`CORRECTED` one. A
same-turn `NEUTRAL` default would be honest too, but it contributes nothing to confidence — the
reinforcement engine would never cross a threshold and the whole propose path would be dead code,
which is the exact inert-surface outcome this atom exists to remove.

**Propose, never install.** A crossed threshold files a `lesson_batch` PROPOSAL through the shared
human-gated queue, exactly like a lesson — this module never writes a `principle` entry. The live
`principle` rows the snapshot injects are written only when the user ACCEPTS, by the installer in
`dashboard/handlers/learning.py`. Everything written here is pre-promotion evidence rows
(`candidate.*`, the `retrospection` ring, the per-session `pending` observation), under the caps.
