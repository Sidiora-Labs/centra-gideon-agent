"""Owner identity — the attribution username (TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES §1).

Gideon is single-user, and every record it writes is implicitly the owner's.
That implicitness is fine until a second identity exists — a shared task board, a
synced second machine, a teammate's contribution — at which point records written
*before* anyone thought about attribution are indistinguishable.

So this ships the cheap half now: one username, stamped onto new writes.

Three semantics matter, and each is a deliberate choice rather than an accident:

* **It is an attribution string, not a credential.** Nothing authenticates against
  it and nothing authorizes on it. It answers "who wrote this row", not "who may".
* **A rename affects future writes only.** Existing records keep the string they
  were written with — rewriting history to match a new name would silently
  falsify the record it exists to preserve.
* **Empty degrades to today's behavior.** An install that never re-onboards has no
  username, writes carry no attribution, and everything reads as the owner's. That
  is the pre-existing behavior, unchanged, so this is additive rather than a break.

The slug rule is strict on purpose: this string lands in JSON records, and later in
shard filenames and sync payloads, effectively forever. A permissive rule would bake
whatever someone typed once — trailing spaces, emoji, a full email address — into
records nobody can rename afterwards.
