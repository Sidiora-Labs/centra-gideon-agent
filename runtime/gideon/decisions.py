"""The personal decision journal — core (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §2, atom PA-4).

A decision entry is a **user item**: a document about the user's life, so it lives in
``knowledge.db`` as the 13th ``NATIVE_TYPES`` entry, created through the one true path
(``store.create_typed_item(item_type="decision", provider="native")``) and riding the
Passthrough pipeline graph exactly like a note or a journal entry. What the research
shape (TradingAgents' one markdown file with HTML-comment delimiters) contributes is the
*lifecycle*, not the file: append-only entries, ``pending → resolved``, pending entries
never evicted.

The distilled lesson the harness learns from a resolution is **memory** — a ``lesson.*``
semantic row written through :meth:`MemoryService.write_lesson`. The two stores stay
structurally uncoupled: ``lesson_memory_key`` is a soft string reference, deliberately
not a foreign key, and it is read back out of the memory store rather than re-derived
here so there is only ever one spelling of a lesson's key.

Nothing in this module writes memory except :func:`resolve_decision`'s final lesson step,
and nothing writes knowledge except the user's own entries and their resolution updates.

**Every store is an injected seam.** ``store`` / ``trigger_store`` / ``memory`` default to
the live singletons but are parameters, so each branch below is testable against a
tmp-path store without a gateway, an embedder, or a model — the same seam
``triggers.tools.create`` uses for its cadence converter.
