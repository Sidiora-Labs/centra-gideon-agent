"""The ONE owner of "where is THIS instance's gateway".

Every child of a gateway — the ``gideon-core`` MCP server, a sandboxed cron
script, an ACP CLI's MCP subprocess — has to know the API base to reach the gateway
that spawned it. Before this module each of them worked that out for itself from
``dashboard.url`` (via ``parse_dashboard_url``) or from ``config.loader.DASHBOARD_PORT``,
and **both** fall back to the fixed ``_DEFAULT_PORT`` of ``10000``.

Why that is not a hang but a cross-instance leak (#2539). ``dashboard.url`` is ``""``
in a default config, and neither ``--port N`` nor ``--port auto`` writes it. So a
gateway bound to port N spawned children addressed to ``10000`` — and *something is
listening there*: in a multi-gateway setup that is a DIFFERENT instance, with its own
home, config and state. Measured end to end on two isolated homes: instance B (home
``…/homeB``, bound ``127.0.0.1:10771``) fired a ``run-script`` action whose
``ctx.notify()`` was **persisted into instance A's** ``notifications.jsonl`` (home
``…/homeA``, bound ``127.0.0.1:10772``) while B's own notification store stayed empty.
The child reported ``{'ok': True}``. Nothing warned. A reading tool in that position is
a cross-instance information leak; a writing tool corrupts another instance's state, and
the request carries this home's ``.local_secret`` to the stranger on the way.

The shape of the fix, and why it is a shape and not a patch:

* **One source of truth.** The only authoritative answer is the socket the gateway
  ACTUALLY bound — known to the gateway and to nothing else. :func:`publish` is called
  once, after bind, with that port; every reader goes through :func:`resolve_port`.
  Two independently-derived answers that can disagree IS the defect, so no second
  resolution path is added: ``parse_dashboard_url`` keeps its (unchanged) job of
  deciding what the server should BIND, and stops being consulted about where a child
  should CONNECT.
* **Fail closed, and fail fast.** When the base cannot be resolved this REFUSES, loudly,
  naming every source it consulted. It never substitutes ``10000``. Per ARCC SAX-04
  Outcome 5 ("Fail Closed vs Fail Open Design Decisions"), *"failing open for
  security-critical operations"* is a named pitfall and a system should *"fail fast
  rather than hanging indefinitely on timeout"* — the old default violated both at once,
  silently delivering the request to whatever stranger occupied the port while the
  observable symptom was a hang.

Resolution order — three projections of ONE fact, never a guess:

1. ``GIDEON_PORT`` — the gateway's own export of its bound port into its process
   environment, inherited by every child it spawns (and the documented dev override).
2. the per-home runtime record written by :func:`publish`, when the pid it names is
   still alive. This covers a child whose environment was rebuilt from an allowlist and
   a helper the gateway did not spawn itself. Being INSIDE the home, it can never name
   another instance's gateway; being pid-checked, a crashed instance's record is not
   trusted.
3. an EXPLICIT port in ``dashboard.url`` — the operator's own declaration.

then refuse. ``_DEFAULT_PORT`` is deliberately unreachable from here.
