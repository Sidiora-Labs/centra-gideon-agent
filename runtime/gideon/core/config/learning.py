"""Config sections for the learning loop: how the system improves from its own runs.

One domain, six sections. They sit together because they form a single pipeline — a loop
runs, a judge scores it, the feedback and evals sections decide what is recorded, and the
learning and planning sections decide what is carried forward. The three coercers here are
domain-specific (a judge axis, a stagnation window, an identity-report cadence) and belong
beside the fields that read them rather than in the shared coercion leaf.

Deliberately NO ``from __future__ import annotations``: ``config/schema.py`` resolves a
STRING annotation by ``eval``-ing it in ``config.loader``'s namespace with a silent
``except: return str`` fallback, so postponed annotations here would degrade this file's
schema types to ``string`` without any error. Real type objects cannot take that path.
