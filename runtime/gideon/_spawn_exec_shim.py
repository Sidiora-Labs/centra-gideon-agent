"""Post-exec resource-ceiling shim — stdlib only, ZERO ``gideon`` imports.

This module is prepended to a child's argv as ``python -m gideon._spawn_exec_shim
<policy-json> -- <real argv...>``. It is deliberately a *pure-stdlib leaf*: it must import
and run in a bare child that has never touched the rest of the package, so the only names
it may reference are Python's own. A test asserts this (``python -c "import
gideon._spawn_exec_shim"`` under ``-S`` succeeds and imports no ``gideon.*``
submodule).

Why deliver limits here, after ``exec``, instead of via ``subprocess``'s ``preexec_fn``:
``preexec_fn`` forces CPython off ``posix_spawn``/``vfork`` onto a full ``fork()`` of the
(heavily multi-threaded) gateway and runs Python *before* ``exec`` in the child. A lock
another thread held at fork time can never be released there, so the child can wedge
before reaching ``exec`` — and because ``_posixsubprocess.child_exec()`` closes inherited
fds only *after* ``preexec_fn``, a wedged child keeps a duplicate of every inherited fd
(the gateway lock, the listening socket) alive, while ``Popen._execute_child`` blocks the
event loop in an unbounded ``os.read(errpipe)`` with no ``await`` point. The shim moves the
delivery point past ``exec``: it runs in the already-exec'd, *single-threaded* child, so a
plain ``os.execv`` cannot wedge on an inherited lock. Coverage is identical — an rlimit set
here is inherited by the exec'd image and all its descendants.

Argv contract::

    python -m gideon._spawn_exec_shim '<policy-json>' -- <argv0> [argv1 ...]

``<policy-json>`` is a compact JSON object (see ``ResourceCeilings`` in ``sandbox.py`` for
the producer):

    {"limits": {"RLIMIT_NOFILE": [soft, hard], ...}, "oom_score_adj": 1000 | null}

* ``limits`` maps a ``resource.RLIMIT_*`` constant *name* to a ``[soft, hard]`` pair. Each
  element is either an integer or the sentinel string ``"hard"`` (resolved in-child to the
  *inherited* hard limit — this is how the ``session_host`` profile raises NOFILE to the
  hard cap without the parent needing to know the child's inherited limit). Each pair is
  applied best-effort: a value the current hard limit forbids is clamped down to that hard
  limit rather than raising (a child must never fail to start because a ceiling was set too
  high for the inherited hard cap).
* ``oom_score_adj`` (Linux only) is written to ``/proc/self/oom_score_adj`` when non-null,
  biasing the OOM killer toward this child. Best-effort: any error (non-Linux, permission,
  missing procfs) is swallowed.

Degradation contract (load-bearing): on a platform without the ``resource`` module
(Windows) the shim applies no limits and simply ``execv``s the target — it NEVER crashes
the child. The single hard failure mode is a malformed/absent argv (no ``--`` separator or
empty target), which exits non-zero with a diagnostic, because there is nothing to exec.
