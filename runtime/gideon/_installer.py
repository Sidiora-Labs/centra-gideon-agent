"""Which tool installs packages into *this* environment (issues #46, #51).

Four separate code paths used to hardcode ``[sys.executable, "-m", "pip", ...]``:
the app dependency installer, the pip-kind self-updater, the startup dep repair,
and the git-checkout updater. A ``uv``-created virtualenv **ships no pip** — uv is
the installer — so every one of them died with ``No module named pip`` on the
project's own documented dev setup (``uv venv`` + ``uv pip install -e ".[dev]"``),
and on the uv-based end-user install path.

The fix is one resolver, used by all four, rather than four copies of the same
detection drifting apart. Order (first available wins):

1. **``uv``** on PATH → ``uv pip install --python <sys.executable> …``. Explicitly
   targeted at the running interpreter: uv otherwise resolves its own notion of
   the active environment (``VIRTUAL_ENV``, or a discovered ``.venv``), which can
   be a *different* env than the one the gateway is importing from — installing
   there would report success while the import still fails.
2. **stdlib ``pip``** as an importable module → the historical command. Probed by
   spec, not by running it, so detection costs no subprocess.
3. Neither → :class:`NoInstallerError`, which names both remedies. Previously this
   surfaced as a bare ``No module named pip`` that pointed at the wrong problem.

``pip`` is checked as a MODULE (``python -m pip``) and never as a bare ``pip``
executable on PATH: a stray system-wide ``pip`` would install into some other
interpreter's site-packages, which is the failure this whole module exists to
prevent.
