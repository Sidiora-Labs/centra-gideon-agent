"""Shared framing for autonomous, no-user-present agent turns.

A scheduled run, a goal loop cycle, and a space member's turn all execute with no
human reachable to answer questions. Without an explicit signal the model falls
back to conversational affordances — asking clarifying questions, offering
``[OPTIONS: …]`` menus — which is wrong for an unattended run: the output is read
later as a report, not answered live.

This module is the single source of truth for that framing so every unattended
runner (cron, goal loops, spaces) prepends the same instruction. Callers wrap
their task prompt with :func:`with_autonomous_framing` (or read
:data:`AUTONOMOUS_TURN_PREAMBLE` directly when they assemble the prompt
themselves).

The preamble text lives in the prompt system as the bundled snippet
``autonomous-turn-preamble`` so it shows up in Settings → Prompts and can be
edited there. :data:`AUTONOMOUS_TURN_PREAMBLE` is the shipped fallback used when
the prompt store can't be resolved (and remains importable for callers that read
it directly).
