"""Project-scoped memory locality (WORK-CONTAINERS §1.6).

Memory is already partitioned by working directory: ``memory_dir_for_cwd`` maps a
session's cwd onto ``<config_dir>/workspace/_ext/<slug(cwd)>``, and an empty cwd onto the
shared ``_ext/_default`` partition. §1.6 builds project locality **on that seam rather than
beside it**: a project-owned session runs with cwd = the project's ``context_dir``, so
everything it remembers lands in that project's partition with no second mechanism.

Two things live here, and only these two:

* :func:`project_memory_cwd` — the cwd a project-owned run binds so its memory is local.
  Read by the run controller before the first node dispatches.
* :func:`compose_recall` — partition-first recall for a project-local session: its own
  partition, then the GLOBAL partition, whose hits are source-labeled and fenced.

**Ordering only, never admission.** The cross-partition half changes only WHERE a hit
appears in the block (after the local hits) and HOW it is framed (labeled + fenced). It
never removes one: when the local partition has nothing and the global partition has
something, the global block is returned alone. Admission stays exactly where it was — on
the store's own relevance scoring. A locality rule that dropped hits would silently delete
recall results, which is indistinguishable from memory loss.
