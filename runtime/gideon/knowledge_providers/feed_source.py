"""Watched feeds — the feed-source provider (WATCHED-SOURCES §3).

The kind for endpoints that are ALREADY structured: RSS 2.0, Atom, JSON Feed, JSON APIs,
and CSV-with-header. There is nothing to detect and nothing to guess here (that is the
web-source's job, §2) — a feed states its own items, so this provider is pure parsing plus
conditional GET, and it costs zero tokens by construction.

**Three parsers, not five formats.** RSS and Atom differ only in element names, so one XML
parser handles both by sniffing the root tag. JSON Feed, HN Algolia and the GitHub recipe
are all "a JSON document containing a list of objects", so they share ONE parser driven by
a declarative field map. CSV is that same field map over header names. Adding a feed
shape is therefore a dict, not a branch.

**Presets are recipes, not code paths (§3.1).** ``hn_algolia`` and ``github_trending`` are
entries in :data:`PRESETS` — a partial spec (url + items path + field map) that a source's
own spec overrides key by key. So a user pointing at an unusual JSON API writes the same
kind of spec the bundled presets are made of, and a preset can be fixed without touching
this module. Nothing about a preset is privileged.

**Conditional GET is the whole cost story (§3.2).** The cursor carries the ETag and
Last-Modified the server last handed back, and every poll offers them as
``If-None-Match`` / ``If-Modified-Since``. A feed that has not changed answers 304 with no
body: the poll is a few hundred bytes, no parse, no items, and the validators are kept so
the next poll is equally cheap. This is what makes a 15-minute interval polite rather than
abusive, and it is the reason the provider must never "just re-fetch to be safe".

**Identity is composed, never invented (§3.3).** A feed that supplies a guid owns its own
identity; one that does not gets the canonicalized URL, and failing that a
``sha256(title + published_at)`` — the cascade in
:mod:`gideon.knowledge.source_identity`. An item from which no identity can be
derived at all is DROPPED rather than emitted, because an un-keyable item would re-ingest
on every single poll: the seen-set can only gate what it can name.

**Never a raise to the engine, never a socket of its own.** Every failure path returns a
soft :class:`SourcePollResult` error so one broken feed degrades to a health status instead
of killing the shared loop, and every byte comes from ``net.fetch`` under the engine-owned
``SOURCE`` egress policy — host classification, private-IP denial and per-redirect-hop
re-checks all live there. ``fetch_fn`` is the single injectable seam so a test drives a
recorded feed body without a network.
