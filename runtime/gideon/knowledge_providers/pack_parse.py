"""Run a connector pack's PARSE-ONLY script (WATCHED-SOURCES §7.1).

A connector pack contributes *parsing*, never *fetching*. The engine performs the HTTP
request through the one guarded seam (``net.fetch`` under the ``SOURCE`` egress policy),
hands the response body to a pack script on **stdin**, and reads ``SourceItem`` JSON lines
back on **stdout**. The script never owns a socket, which is the entire reason an untrusted
third-party parser is safe to run at all: the dangerous capability is not held by the code
that came from a stranger.

**What actually stops the socket.** ``sandbox.wrap_argv`` — the shared OS path sandbox this
module also uses — denies *file reads* of credential paths; its Seatbelt profile is
``(allow default)`` plus deny-read rules and its Linux launcher unshares only
``CLONE_NEWUSER``/``CLONE_NEWNS``. Neither denies network, and on a host where
``detect_backend()`` answers ``none`` (this project's own macOS 26 dev machine, where
``sandbox_apply`` is refused for third-party callers) it is not applied at all. So the OS
sandbox is a real control over the *filesystem* and no control whatsoever over *egress*, and
pretending otherwise would leave the property this atom exists for resting on nothing.

The live rail is therefore in-process, installed by :data:`_PARSE_HARNESS_SRC` before the pack
script is executed. It is **three mechanisms plus a verification**, and the division of labour
between them is MEASURED, not assumed: under ``python -I`` exactly three denied names are
already in ``sys.modules`` at startup (``os``, ``os.path``, ``posix``) and no others.

1. A finder at ``sys.meta_path[0]`` refuses :data:`DENIED_MODULES`. This is what stops
   ``socket``, ``ssl``, ``ctypes``, ``subprocess``, ``urllib.request`` and ``importlib``:
   none is pre-imported, so every route to them — an ``import`` statement, a
   ``from … import``, ``importlib.import_module`` — reaches a finder, and ours runs first.
2. The three pre-imported names are EVICTED from ``sys.modules``. Without this ``import os``
   is served from the startup cache and never reaches a finder at all, so the finder alone
   would leave the spawn-a-child route wide open.
3. The process-spawning callables on those same live module objects are NEUTERED. Eviction
   removes the *name*, not the *object*: ``object.__subclasses__()`` finds ``os._wrap_close``,
   whose ``__init__.__globals__`` IS the os module dict, so ``os.system`` stays reachable with
   no import at all. This child parses one body and is discarded, so wrecking its copy of the
   stdlib costs nothing.
4. After the script returns the harness verifies 1 and 2 survived and reports
   ``fence: tampered`` otherwise — and the parent discards the whole batch. A script that
   removes the fence gets zero items.

A fourth mechanism was built and then DELETED: wrapping ``builtins.__import__`` to check the
denylist before delegating. Removing it reded nothing, and the measurement above is why — with
the three pre-imported names evicted, every denied import already reaches the finder, so the
wrapper was a second path to the same refusal. Two mechanisms where one suffices is the
dual-path this project does not keep, and an untested layer is decoration, not defence.

:data:`DENIED_MODULES` is a **denylist, deliberately**, and it is closed *for this property*
rather than being a general jail. Every way CPython reaches a network in-process bottoms out
at one of three things: ``_socket`` (which ``socket``/``ssl``/``http``/``urllib``/
``asyncio``/every third-party client is built on), ``_ctypes`` (raw ``libc`` calls), or a
spawned child (``os``/``subprocess``/``_posixsubprocess``/``multiprocessing``). Denying those
roots denies the set. An allowlist of *importable* modules was tried first and rejected: the
stdlib's own lazy imports (``csv`` → ``_csv``, ``datetime`` → ``_datetime``, ``re`` →
``re._compiler``) make an allowlist break legitimate parsers for reasons an author cannot
predict, and a fence that fails on correct code gets removed.

**Fail closed on output, by construction.** The harness emits a nonce-tagged terminator line
after the script returns; the nonce is delivered in a config file the harness unlinks on
read, so the script cannot forge it. The parent REQUIRES that line. A script that crashes
mid-write, is killed on timeout, blows the output cap, or emits one malformed line yields
**zero** items and a typed :class:`ParseFailure` — never a half-ingested batch, because a
partially-ingested feed is indistinguishable from a feed that shrank.

Bounds reuse core's own ceilings rather than a bare ``subprocess.run``: the ``tool`` resource
profile via ``spawn_shim_argv`` (NOFILE/NPROC/RSS + OOM bias), the allowlisted child
environment via ``build_child_env``, a wall-clock timeout, an input cap and an output cap.
