"""The pure tick decision core (P6).

The Goal-Loop supervisor's per-cycle lifecycle decision, extracted as a **pure
function** over an immutable snapshot: ``evaluate(cfg, state, now) -> Decision``.
No ``store``, no ``ctx``, no I/O — the adapter (the watchdog) gathers a snapshot
(findings count, verdict trail, phase timings, budget, a pre-computed metric) and
applies whatever ``Decision`` this returns. Pulling the decision out of the
watchdog's stateful poll makes the lifecycle logic exhaustively unit-testable and
makes the loop **restartable**: every input is derived from persisted state, so a
fresh process re-derives the same ``Decision`` with no in-memory liveness cache.

The metric gate + dwell/bake + zero-wait collapse + auto-rollback all live here as
pure branches. I/O the decision *implies* (running a verify command, a judge pass)
happens in the adapter and its RESULT is fed back in as ``state.metric`` next tick —
the key design line that keeps this function pure (see the plan's Risks §).

**PP-15 — this is now the ONE convergence decision, for both engines.** It used to be
consulted by exactly one loop kind while the workflows loop node ran a second, stateful
copy of the same reasoning (``loop_middleware.check_middleware``: identical-call /
hypothesis-exhausted / no-progress detection plus an escalation ladder). Two
implementations of "is this loop converging?" is how the two engines drifted, and the
drift was invisible — both sides read plausibly and only disagreed at the boundary. So
the ladder moved HERE, as pure branches over persisted counters, and the second copy was
deleted rather than kept behind a flag.

The move cost the ladder its mutability, which is the point. ``check_middleware``
advanced a cursor on the state object it was handed (``state.escalation_index = index``),
so the decision depended on how many times it had been *called* — unreproducible after a
restart, and untestable without replaying the call sequence. Here the rung is DERIVED
from counters that are already on disk (``escalations_taken``, ``attempts_at_rung``,
``nudges_issued``), and the adapter advances them with :func:`applied` once it has acted.
Same (cfg, state, now) in, same ``Decision`` out — including which rung.

Two members carry what the loops engine could not previously say:

* ``ESCALATE`` — take a rung (``Decision.rung``): the run continues with a changed
  STRATEGY (fresh session, model switch, workspace reset). Without it the engine failed
  BINARY, straight from "two consecutive errors" to "a human must look at this", making
  every middle rung of the declared ladder unreachable.
* ``REPLAN`` — the PLAN is wrong, not the execution. The adapter turns this into a real
  ``mutations`` batch (insert/delete/move/run_from) applied at the controller's drain
  point, so a run re-derives its remaining steps from a judge critique instead of
  retrying the same plan with a hint attached.
