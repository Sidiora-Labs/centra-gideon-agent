"""Unified Loop manager — the shared lifecycle for every kind.

Owns the kind-agnostic orchestration: arm/start/resume, pause, stop, nudge,
teardown, and the startup orphan-reap. The per-kind framing (the durable brief +
the per-cycle trigger) is delegated to the loop's :class:`LoopKindStrategy`
(``build_brief`` / ``cycle_nudge``); the manager resolves the project context dir
+ tool roots and owns the file write, so the strategy stays pure.

Kept free of the dashboard + autonudge concretions (passed in as ``state`` /
``svc``) so it's unit-testable and import-cycle-free — same discipline as the
legacy loops/code managers it unifies.

    Lives here because this module owns every session key a loop spends under, and the figure is

    ``usage/turns.jsonl`` through the ordinary chat seam (``chat_runner`` passes
    ``session._app or "chat"``, and the worker's ``_app`` is ``"loop"``), so no loop-specific
    writer is involved — only a loop-specific READ.

    Two figures, deliberately not summed into one:

    * ``worker`` — :func:`session_key` and every :func:`task_session_key` under it, via a
      separator-aware prefix query. A fan-out loop that under-counted its task workers would
      report a confidently-low number, so the prefix is the point.
    * ``planning`` — ``plan_walkthrough.planner_session_key``, which is ``loop-plan-<id>`` and
      therefore NOT under the worker prefix. Reported beside the worker figure rather than folded
      into it: the planner is a distinct session doing distinct work, and a surface that silently
      omitted it would imply a completeness the number does not have. The caller renders both.

    NOT ``ledger.run_totals``. That reads ``loop/journal.py``'s ``step_completed`` rows, which
    carry no ``tokens`` and no ``cost_usd``, so making it work would mean copying turn dollars
    into a second store — one dollar in two records, in a subsystem whose own money doctrine
    (``routing/usage.py`` module docstring) is that a total which can double-count is worse than
    one that admits a gap. See MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY's MRT-3 log for the recorded deviation.
