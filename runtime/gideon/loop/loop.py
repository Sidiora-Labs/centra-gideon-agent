"""Unified Loop data model — the one autonomous primitive.

Gideon has a single autonomous engine: the **Loop**. Every loop shares the
same spine (understand → break into phases → plan with persona/skills/workflows →
execute each phase until its goal is met) and the same machinery (nudge + a
deterministic watchdog + a file-based worker↔supervisor split). What differs per
loop is **subject-matter expertise**, supplied by a per-:data:`kind` strategy
(see :mod:`gideon.loop.kinds`): how it classifies the task, phases the
problem, gates done-ness, loads capabilities, and frames the worker brief.

Kinds: ``general`` (Claude-Code-``/loop``-style generic iteration), ``goal``
(verifiable/open-ended/monitor research+action), ``code`` (SDLC stage-gated work
in a workspace), ``design`` (design-system creation).

The entity holds the genuinely-shared lifecycle/timing/identity fields at the top
level (what the store/manager/watchdog touch generically) plus a ``kind_config``
dict the kind strategy owns (goal_type+granularity; entry_stage+stage_plan;
design tokens; …). Kind-specific *behavior* lives in the strategy, never here.

#: alongside ``COMPLETE`` and ``STOPPED`` — and it is still a ``resume`` source. Those two facts
#: only look contradictory while "ended" and "terminal" are the same word; split apart, ``FAILED``
#: is simply the one ended state this noun can leave (:data:`RESUMABLE_ENDED_STATUSES`).

#: `PP-16`: the union of the four action rows omitted ``INTAKE`` and ``PLANNING``, so a loop whose

#: which discards the record instead of terminating it. ``stop`` is the right home because
#: ``STOPPED`` is terminal and needs no worker to reach: ``manager.stop`` tears down whatever is
#: armed (``_teardown`` no-ops when nothing is) and ``store.update_status`` refuses only
#: transitions OUT of a terminal state, so both pre-launch states could always reach it — the guard
