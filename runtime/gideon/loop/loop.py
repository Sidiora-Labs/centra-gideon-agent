"""Unified Loop data model — the one autonomous primitive.

Gideon has a single autonomous engine: the **Loop**. Every loop shares the
same spine (understand → break into phases → plan with persona/skills/workflows →
execute each phase until its goal is met) and the same machinery (nudge + a
deterministic watchdog + a file-based worker↔supervisor split). What differs per
loop is **subject-matter expertise**, supplied by a per-:data:`kind` strategy
(see :mod:`gideon.loop.kinds`): how it classifies the task, phases the
problem, gates done-ness, loads capabilities, and frames the worker brief.

Kinds: ``general`` (Claude-Code-``/loop``-style generic iteration), ``goal``
(verifiable/open-ended/monitor research+action), ``code`` (SDLC stage-gated work
in a workspace), ``design`` (design-system creation).

The entity holds the genuinely-shared lifecycle/timing/identity fields at the top
level (what the store/manager/watchdog touch generically) plus a ``kind_config``
dict the kind strategy owns (goal_type+granularity; entry_stage+stage_plan;
design tokens; …). Kind-specific *behavior* lives in the strategy, never here.

         operates FROM its files dir: the brief tells the worker "(none — operate from the

         (brief/findings/FINDINGS.md) in the loop dir and write their deliverable to the

         greenfield loop 07d5a0d0, 15/15 tests green, stage held across cycles);

         the project context dir" per the Loop model);

         workspace AND no project actually runs (the common open-ended-goal case; observed
         live: goal 0fef190e wrote its deliverable to the workspace root).
