"""Unified Loop watchdog — the deterministic supervisor for every kind.

Owns the kind-agnostic lifecycle, polling RUNNING loops and deciding each cycle
whether to keep going, complete, stall, fail, or pause for the user. The
done-ness *signal* is always produced by something OTHER than the worker — it's
delegated to the loop's :class:`LoopKindStrategy` ``is_done_signal`` (a verify
command, a judge subagent, all-phases-gated). The watchdog *decides*; the
strategy only *advises*. This upholds the tenet that no agent certifies its own
work.

Shared lifecycle (all kinds): trust-TTL expiry → NEEDS_INPUT, attended/unattended
question handling, new-finding bookkeeping (clear guidance, stamp nudges, publish),
budget cap, stagnation, loop-exhaustion finalize, and the unresponsive deadline.
The parallel task-worker scheduler (code/design) lands in 2c(iv); this is the
sequential supervisor every kind needs.
