"""Pure brief + parser + projection helpers for the DESIGN kind's stepwise planning
walkthrough — the dynamic design-pass step list, per-step briefs, the JSON parsers, and
the breakdown→plan projection. No store/orchestration deps (those live in
loop.plan_walkthrough); just the deterministic, unit-testable pieces the design
Walkthrough delegate wraps. Mirrors code_plan_briefs / goal_plan_briefs.

A Design loop IS a loop (the vision): Understand the design task → break it into phased
executions by design-space expertise → an execution plan → loop each phase. This module
drives the planning half (Understand → phased breakdown), walked one approvable step at
a time, exactly like goal/code — so a design loop is no longer the shallow "skip planning,
free-run" case it was before."""
