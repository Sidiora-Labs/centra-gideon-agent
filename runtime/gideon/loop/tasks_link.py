"""Loop ↔ Tasks integration — provision the backing Tasks Project + per-phase
TaskLists for a loop, seed/decompose the planner's tasks, and reconcile them.

The unified version of the legacy ``code/tasks_link.py`` (and the goal intake's
task creation), operating on the :class:`gideon.loop.loop.Loop` entity:
phases come from ``loop.plan`` keyed by the kind strategy's ``phase_key`` (SDLC
stage for code, title for goal/design), and the parallel-execution queue lives in
``kind_config['queued_task_ids']``. Drives the REAL Tasks system — no parallel
