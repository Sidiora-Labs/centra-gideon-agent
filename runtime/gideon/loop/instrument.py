"""Loop self-instrumentation — the P4 "prove-the-instrument" gates.

Before an open-ended loop trusts a verdict about its own work, two guards run:

* :func:`probe_judge` (the **canary**) — feed the judge a synthetic obviously-strong
  and obviously-null cycle and assert it separates them. A judge that can't tell good
  from empty is *blind*; trusting its verdicts would emit plausible-but-wrong
  completions. On a blind judge the loop halts for the user (NEEDS_INPUT) rather than
  self-completing on garbage.
* :func:`reproduce_confirm` (the **independent REPRODUCE**) — before a completed loop's
  deliverable is graduated to a permanent artifact, re-observe ground truth (re-run the
  verify command and/or re-read + re-score the deliverable) with a *fresh* judge pass.
  If that second, independent observation disagrees with the completing verdict, the
  ship is blocked and the discrepancy surfaced — a completion is never shipped on a
  single observation.

Both are best-effort and fail SAFE: a probe that can't run defers (never a false
"blind"); a reproduce that can't run does not block a ship (never a false "blocked").
The point is to catch a *confidently wrong* instrument, not to add a new failure mode.
