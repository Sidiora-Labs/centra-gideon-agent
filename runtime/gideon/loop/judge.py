"""The judge subagent — the third-party cycle assessor (§5.4).

A dedicated, **separate** agent — never the worker, never a member of a
multi-agent roster — assesses each cycle's output for the open-ended (§5.2) and
stuck-detector (§5.1) paths. It is the mechanism that lets us assess done-ness
with an LLM *without* violating VISION's tenet: it has no stake in the work,
having not produced it. The worker only *produces*; the judge *advises*; the
supervisor (deterministic) *decides*.

It receives the goal/DoD + the cycle's finding + a compact digest of prior
findings and emits a structured verdict:

    {done, done_reason, marginal_value (0-5), quality_score (0-5), regressed}

It runs in its own session with no write tools — it reads and judges, it doesn't
act. Built on the eval :class:`LLMJudge` (the same provider seam the ratchet
already uses) but with its own done-ness + marginal-value rubric.
