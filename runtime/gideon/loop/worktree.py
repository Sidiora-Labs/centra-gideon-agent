"""Git worktree management for parallel task execution (unified loop engine).

When a loop's workspace is a git repo, the scheduler can run several READY tasks
of a phase at once — each in its own worktree (a linked checkout sharing the
repo's object store) on its own branch, so concurrent workers don't stomp each
other's files. When a phase's tasks all finish, their worktrees are merged back
to the base branch and removed. Vendor-neutral git infra shared by any kind that
parallelizes (code today; design later).

Capability detection decides parallel-vs-sequential: parallel needs a present
``git`` binary AND a workspace that is (or was just) a git repo. A brownfield
workspace with no git, or a missing git binary, falls back to sequential (one
task at a time in the workspace directly) — handled by the caller.

All git calls are best-effort and time-bounded; failures degrade to sequential
rather than raising.
