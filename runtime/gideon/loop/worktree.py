"""Git worktree management for parallel task execution (unified loop engine).

When a loop's workspace is a git repo, the scheduler can run several READY tasks
of a phase at once — each in its own worktree (a linked checkout sharing the
repo's object store) on its own branch, so concurrent workers don't stomp each
other's files. When a phase's tasks all finish, their worktrees are merged back
to the base branch and removed. Vendor-neutral git infra shared by any kind that
parallelizes (code today; design later).

Capability detection decides parallel-vs-sequential: parallel needs a present
``git`` binary AND a workspace that is (or was just) a git repo. A brownfield
workspace with no git, or a missing git binary, falls back to sequential (one
task at a time in the workspace directly) — handled by the caller.

All git calls are best-effort and time-bounded; failures degrade to sequential
rather than raising.

# §1 is explicitly a MEASURED-bottleneck plan: the hydration tuning in §1.2 (sparse
# checkout, pooled creation, a reuse pool) is only allowed to be built if a fan-out
# actually pays for it. That decision needs a number from the real function, on real
# repos, over time — so the timing line ships whether or not the gate opens.
#
# The line is a CONTRACT, not a debug aid, because its whole purpose is comparison
# across runs and across machines. Hence a fixed prefix and fixed `key=value` fields:
#
#   worktree add outcome=created task=t-abc ms=812 files=10432 size_class=large
#
# * ``outcome`` first, because it decides whether the row is a hydration sample at all.
#   ``created`` is the cost §1.2 would attack; ``reused`` is add_worktree's idempotent
#   early return (near-zero, and the datapoint a reuse pool would be judged against);
#   ``failed`` carries a duration too — a creation that burned the whole ``_TIMEOUT``
#   before failing is the most interesting row on the page, and dropping it would make
#   the timeout case invisible in exactly the measurement meant to find it.
# * ``ms`` is an integer of milliseconds. Not seconds-with-decimals: these are compared
#   by eye and by grep, and a float would print `1e-05` on the reuse path.
# * ``files`` AND ``size_class`` both, even though the class is derived from the count.
#   The count is what makes two runs comparable when a repo grows; the class is what
#   makes a mixed log greppable without arithmetic.
# * ``task`` so a fan-out's N rows can be told apart and joined to the run.

#
# HC-1's measurement opened the gate: a fan-out of 4 on a 10K-file repo cost 5216 ms
# mean per worktree against a 286 ms ambient floor, so ~2.7 s of even the CHEAPEST
# sample is hydration. §1.2's three levers all attack that hydration, and each has a
# different failure mode, so each is a separate seam here:
#
# * SPARSE — hydrate only the paths a task names. Scope is a HINT (§Risks): it is
#   derived from task text, validated against the index, and any miss auto-widens.
# * POOL — the phase's READY worktrees are created concurrently, bounded.
# * REUSE — a SURVIVING worktree is reset instead of handed back as-is.
#
# **The measured reason auto-widening is load-bearing, not a nicety.** In a cone-mode
# sparse worktree an out-of-cone write is not refused by the filesystem — the file lands.
# But ``git add -A`` then declines to stage it and exits 1, staging NOTHING, and the
# following ``commit`` exits 1 with "nothing added to commit". Git does signal this;
# :func:`merge_worktree` DISCARDS both exit codes (it always has), so the branch is
# merged without the work and the merge reports success. Net effect without widening: a
# task that writes one file outside its stated scope silently loses it, and every status
# surface says the task merged cleanly. That is why :func:`widen_for_pending` runs inside
# :func:`merge_worktree` BEFORE its ``add -A``, and why the covering tests assert the file
# is in the resulting commit rather than asserting that a widen command was issued.
#
# Cone mode (the default for ``sparse-checkout set``) is used deliberately: its entries
# are DIRECTORIES and root-level files stay hydrated, so a scoped worktree still has the
# repo's build/config files (pyproject, Makefile, package.json) that any real task needs.

#: Ceiling on concurrent ``git worktree add`` calls (§1.2 "bounded by os.cpu_count(),
#: ceiling 4"). Matches ``sdlc._POOL_CAP`` — a phase never has more than that many
#: task-workers in flight, so a wider pool could not be used even if the box were bigger.
POOL_CEILING = 4

#: Candidate path token: at least one ``/`` so a bare word ("worktree", "tests") can
#: never become a cone entry, and no whitespace. The final component must START with a
#: word char or dash, which is what stops a sentence-final "…do not touch web/." from
#: yielding the token ``web/.`` (measured: it did, and then resolved to the ``web``
#: directory). Bounded by ``_MAX_SCOPE_CANDIDATES`` below because this text is
#: model-authored — an over-long list would spend more git time resolving scope than the
#: sparse checkout saves.
#:
#: **Polarity is deliberately NOT modelled.** "Do not touch web/src" contributes ``web/src``
#: exactly like "edit web/src" would. That is acceptable because the two failure directions
#: are not symmetric: over-inclusion only costs some of the hydration saving, while
#: under-inclusion is caught by :func:`widen_for_pending`. Neither can break a task, which

    §1.2's reuse pool: where hydration dominates, resetting an existing checkout beats
    remove + re-add. False means the caller must tear down (remove + add fresh) — a
    half-reset worktree is worse than none, because it silently hands the next run the
    previous one's leftovers.

    **The recipe is three commands, not the plan's two.** §1.2 specifies
    ``checkout -B <branch> <base>`` + ``clean -fd``; measured, that pair leaves BOTH a
    modified tracked file and a staged index in place — ``checkout -B`` carries local
    modifications across on purpose, and ``clean`` only touches untracked files. So a
    ``reset --hard`` sits between them, and ``clean`` takes ``-x`` as well: ignored files
    are the previous run's build output, and leaving them is exactly the cross-run leak
    this exists to prevent. Both gaps are covered by their own tests.
