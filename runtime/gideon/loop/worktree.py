"""Git worktree management for parallel task execution (unified loop engine).

When a loop's workspace is a git repo, the scheduler can run several READY tasks
of a phase at once — each in its own worktree (a linked checkout sharing the
repo's object store) on its own branch, so concurrent workers don't stomp each
other's files. When a phase's tasks all finish, their worktrees are merged back
to the base branch and removed. Vendor-neutral git infra shared by any kind that
parallelizes (code today; design later).

Capability detection decides parallel-vs-sequential: parallel needs a present
``git`` binary AND a workspace that is (or was just) a git repo. A brownfield
workspace with no git, or a missing git binary, falls back to sequential (one
task at a time in the workspace directly) — handled by the caller.

All git calls are best-effort and time-bounded; failures degrade to sequential
rather than raising.

# §1 is explicitly a MEASURED-bottleneck plan: the hydration tuning in §1.2 (sparse
# checkout, pooled creation, a reuse pool) is only allowed to be built if a fan-out
# actually pays for it. That decision needs a number from the real function, on real
# repos, over time — so the timing line ships whether or not the gate opens.
#
# The line is a CONTRACT, not a debug aid, because its whole purpose is comparison
# across runs and across machines. Hence a fixed prefix and fixed `key=value` fields:
#
#   worktree add outcome=created task=t-abc ms=812 files=10432 size_class=large
#
# * ``outcome`` first, because it decides whether the row is a hydration sample at all.
#   ``created`` is the cost §1.2 would attack; ``reused`` is add_worktree's idempotent
#   early return (near-zero, and the datapoint a reuse pool would be judged against);
#   ``failed`` carries a duration too — a creation that burned the whole ``_TIMEOUT``
#   before failing is the most interesting row on the page, and dropping it would make
#   the timeout case invisible in exactly the measurement meant to find it.
# * ``ms`` is an integer of milliseconds. Not seconds-with-decimals: these are compared
#   by eye and by grep, and a float would print `1e-05` on the reuse path.
# * ``files`` AND ``size_class`` both, even though the class is derived from the count.
#   The count is what makes two runs comparable when a repo grows; the class is what
#   makes a mixed log greppable without arithmetic.
# * ``task`` so a fan-out's N rows can be told apart and joined to the run.
