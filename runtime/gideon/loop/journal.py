"""The loop's ledger — the SECOND producer of the platform ledger (PP-5).

`workflows/journal.py` made the workflow engine the first producer of
:mod:`gideon.ledger`; this module makes the loop engine the second. Every property is
inherited from :class:`~gideon.ledger.writer.LedgerWriter` — append-only, `redact()` on
every write, deterministic `event_id`, the `events.jsonl` mirror — and the only loop-shaped thing
here is the four typed emitters and the store binding.

Why this exists (PP-5). `learning/mining.py` derives from *"the run's own journal"*, so the outer
improvement loop learned from workflow runs and nothing else — the loop kinds, which carry the
long-horizon autonomous work, were a blind spot because their findings/verdicts lived in their own
file store with no event vocabulary. A loop that emits the SAME kinds a workflow does
(`step_started`/`step_completed`, `judge_verdict`, `breaker_trip`, `watcher_reaped`) is visible to
the flywheel through the same reader.

The vocabulary is imported from :mod:`gideon.ledger`, never re-minted: a loop that emitted
its own `cycle_finished` would be the fifth dialect the extraction (PP-4) and the verdict
reconciliation (WF2LOO-16) exist to prevent. `judge_verdict` in particular carries the reconciled
:class:`~gideon.workflows.judge_contract.JudgeVerdict` shape — the loop no longer has a
private verdict dialect.

Boundary: this is a LOOP-side thing that writes THROUGH the ledger primitive. `gideon.ledger`
does not, and may not, import `gideon.loop` — the direction is the whole point (the rail
`test_the_ledger_package_does_not_import_the_workflow_engine` guards it). `loop.store` is the
:class:`~gideon.ledger.writer.LedgerStore` this ledger appends through.
