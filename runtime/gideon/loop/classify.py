"""Goal classifier — the intake analyze pass (§6).

The planner runs one LLM call the moment a goal is submitted. It decides the
*kind* of goal (which picks the stop logic), how hard to interrogate the user
upfront, whether to run solo or multi-agent (and with which roster + strategy),
and seeds the decomposition. Everything it returns is a recommendation the user
can override on the Plan Review.

Pure orchestration like :mod:`grill`: the LLM call is injected as a callable, so
this module has no provider/dashboard coupling and is unit-testable.
