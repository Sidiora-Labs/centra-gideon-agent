"""SDLC classifier — the Code intake analyze pass.

The planner runs one LLM call the moment a Code task is submitted. It decides
*what SDLC stage the input is already at* (which picks the stages still to run),
how hard to interrogate the user upfront, whether the project is greenfield or
brownfield, and seeds the stage plan + task breakdown. Everything it returns is a
recommendation the user can override on the Plan Review.

Pure orchestration like :mod:`gideon.loops.classify`: the LLM call is
injected as a callable, so this module has no provider/dashboard coupling and is
unit-testable. Stage-plan philosophy: a staged SDLC flow
(discovery→construction→operation) with human approval gates; a bias to a runnable
vertical slice with ruthless scoping; and a plan-then-execute loop with a
kept-honest task list and read-before-write / verify-after-edit. Each stage names
ONE objective, explicit exit criteria, and ONE deliverable.
