"""The ONE loop supervisor — one evaluator over a declared policy (`PP-16`, seam 3).

A loop's done-ness used to be pluggable Python: a ``LoopKindStrategy.is_done_signal`` per kind
plus two satellite hooks (``has_done_check``, ``budget_stop_genuine``) the watchdog reached for
with ``getattr``, and a third rule (``_stagnation_disabled``) hard-coded in the watchdog against
one kind's name. Five implementations, three lookup styles, and no single place that answered
"what completes this loop?".

This module is that place. It reads a :class:`~gideon.workflows.supervisor_policy.\
SupervisorPolicy` — the object `PP-14` declared and `PP-15` wired — and dispatches its
``convergence.signal`` to the ONE implementation of that mechanism. The domain knowledge that
used to be spread over five modules is now DATA in
:data:`~gideon.workflows.supervisor_policy.KIND_CONVERGENCE`; the code below is
kind-agnostic and never branches on ``loop.kind``.

**No new vocabulary.** A done-signal names which MECHANISM produces the answer; what a judge
actually decided still travels in ``judge_contract``'s verdict types, adjudicated by
``judge_contract.adjudicate``. `WF2LOO-16` reconciled those dialects and this module adds none.

**The tenet is unchanged: no agent certifies its own work.** Every mechanism here is the
SUPERVISOR's own read — a command it runs, a judge subagent it commissions — never the worker's
self-report. The watchdog still owns the lifecycle decision; this only supplies the signal.
