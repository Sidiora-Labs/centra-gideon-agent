"""Code kind — SDLC stage-gated work in a workspace (the mini-IDE cockpit).

The task is classified to an SDLC entry stage; the plan is an ordered set of
stages each gated by explicit exit criteria (the supervisor runs the project's
``verify_command``/``test_command`` and a conservative judge over recent
findings — never the worker's self-report). Module named ``sdlc`` to avoid
shadowing the stdlib ``code`` module. Slice 1 supplies config + phase keying; the
full stage-gate + worktree behavior ports from the legacy ``code/`` engine in
Slice 2.
