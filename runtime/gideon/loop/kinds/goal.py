"""Goal kind — open-ended / verifiable / monitor research + action loops.

Done-ness is **type-driven** (the principle that no agent certifies its own work):
verifiable runs a deterministic ``verify_command``; open-ended consults a separate
judge subagent's ROI verdict; monitor never self-completes. Slice 1 supplies the
classification/config shape + phase keying; the full classify/judge/ratchet
behavior ports from the legacy ``loops/`` engine in Slice 2.
