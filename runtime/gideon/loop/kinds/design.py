"""Design kind — design-system creation (live canvas, tokens, components, exports).

Helps the user build a comprehensive design system: Gideon ships an
exhaustive default token set (every look-and-feel axis), and the loop guides the
user through choosing overrides and generating React components against it. As a
loop it follows the shared spine (understand → phase → plan → execute), but its
surfaces add a live component canvas, screenshot palette/primitive extraction,
drag-drop composition, and design-system exports (token artifacts, exportable
components, DESIGN.md). Slice 1 supplies the config/phase shape; the full
