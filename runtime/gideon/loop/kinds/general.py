"""General kind — a Claude-Code-``/loop``-style generic iterative goal.

The fallback when a task isn't a known space (goal/code/design): a free-form
iterative loop in a chat session that reuses the shared nudge + watchdog. Minimal
subject-matter expertise — no specialized classification or phasing beyond an
optional verify command and a flat, optional set of self-defined phases. The point
is the generic mechanics, not domain breakdown.
