"""Pure brief + parser helpers for the RESEARCH kind's stepwise planning walkthrough.

Research planning is a deep-research PLAN, not a goal decomposition: intent →
subtopics (the living research plan) → output format & manner → execution plan. The
generic brief assembly + artifact JSON parser are shared with the goal walkthrough
(``goal_plan_briefs``); only the step set + per-step artifact contract differ here, so
a research loop's Plan Review reads as research planning rather than goal sub-goals.
