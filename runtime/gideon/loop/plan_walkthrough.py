"""The unified stepwise planning walkthrough — kind-agnostic orchestration.

Both the goal and code kinds plan their work as a **gated, stepwise walkthrough**
over a :class:`gideon.planning.session.PlanSession`: the planner agent
produces one step's artifact, the loop BLOCKS on the user's review gate (approve /
comment / edit), and only then advances. The difference is per-kind and lives in a
:class:`Walkthrough` delegate the strategy supplies:

  - **fixed** (goal) — a stable ordered step list (intent → sub-goals → quorum →
    execution_plan); no design pass.
  - **dynamic** (code) — a first *design pass* in which the planner investigates
    the target and decides the ordered step list itself, then a step pass per step.

This module owns the SHARED state machine (seed → design → step → gate → finalize)
on the unified store/runner; the delegate owns the kind-specific briefs, parsers,
and the projection of approved artifacts into the loop spec. A kind without a
walkthrough (general/design today) returns ``None`` from ``Loop`` strategy's
``walkthrough()`` and the plan routes 404 for it.
