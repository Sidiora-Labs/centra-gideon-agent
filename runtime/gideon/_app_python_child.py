"""Run an app's Python entry script with the app packages loaded AFTER the interpreter's own.

``python -m gideon._app_python_child <script.py> [args...]``

The packages apps declare live in ``<home>/app-python`` (``apps/app_python.py``), and the gateway
loads them by APPENDING that directory to ``sys.path``: whatever the interpreter already provides
always wins the import, so an app can add a module but never replace one the gateway uses. A child
the gateway starts for an app — its backend, its background worker — needs the same packages with
the same precedence, and ``PYTHONPATH`` cannot give it that: its entries come BEFORE the standard
library and site-packages. Those children are started through the resource-ceiling shim
(``python -m gideon._spawn_exec_shim``), so an app package on ``PYTHONPATH`` named
``resource`` would shadow the very module the shim limits the child with.

So the child runs this module instead of the script: it appends every directory named in
``GIDEON_APP_PYTHON_PATH`` with :func:`site.addsitedir` (processing ``.pth`` files, exactly
as the gateway does), then runs the script as ``__main__`` the way ``python <script.py>`` would —
``sys.argv[0]`` is the script and ``sys.path[0]`` is its directory.

Stdlib only and free of ``gideon`` imports, like ``_spawn_exec_shim``: it runs before any app
code, in a child that has not imported the rest of the package.
