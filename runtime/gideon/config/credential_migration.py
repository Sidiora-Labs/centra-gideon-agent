"""``credentials_to_keychain`` — the consented, snapshot-backed credential move (SH-2).

Moving a user's secrets between stores is the one operation in this codebase where the
project's clean-break licence does **not** apply. The pre-1.0 banner says data may break
without migration; it does not license *silently losing a credential*, which presents to the
user as "my agent stopped working" with no evidence of what happened. So this module is
built around one property:

    🔴 **NO KEY LEAVES ``.env`` UNTIL ITS VALUE HAS BEEN READ BACK OUT OF THE KEYCHAIN.**

Everything else here exists to make that property survivable:

* **A snapshot precedes the first write.** ``.env``'s exact bytes are copied to
  ``.env.pre-keychain`` (mode 0600, atomic) *before* any keychain write and *before* any
  ``.env`` rewrite. :func:`rollback_credentials_to_keychain` restores those bytes verbatim —
  a byte comparison, not a re-serialisation, because a "field-for-field" rewrite is exactly
  how a comment or an unparsed line goes missing.
* **It is idempotent, not re-entrant-by-luck.** A second run finds nothing left in ``.env``
  and returns ``moved=[]`` without touching the snapshot. Overwriting the snapshot on a
  second run would replace the pre-migration ``.env`` with the post-migration one and
  destroy the only thing rollback reads.
* **It is a no-op unless the keychain is genuinely ACTIVE.** ``credential_backend()`` — the
  resolved outcome, never the request — must say ``keychain``. A box that merely *asked* for
  one has nowhere to put the secrets, and emptying ``.env`` there is the data loss this
  module exists to prevent.
* **It never returns a value.** Every result field carries key NAMES only. A migration
  report that echoed a secret would put credentials in the API response, the SEL row and the
  browser's memory at once.

⚠️  **This is deliberately NOT a lifecycle gate/migration pair.** ``LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE.md``
was deleted in PR #897 and there is no ``lifecycle/`` package; ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` keeps the
regime as "a mental model, not shipped machinery", deferred until the architecture stops
moving. Hand-rolling a ``m_*`` migration registry here would build a parallel mechanism that
the real one deletes. What SH-2's prose actually asks for — user-consented, snapshot-backed,
reversible, idempotent, verified — is expressed with the house patterns instead: an
``IF NOT EXISTS``-shaped precondition check, a tolerant reader, and an explicit consent flag.
Recorded as a DEVIATION in the plan's execution log.
