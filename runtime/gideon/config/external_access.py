"""Config sections for external access: the surfaces reachable from outside the host.

One domain, three sections plus the surface table they all key off. Grouped because the
per-surface shape is shared: ``EXTERNAL_ACCESS_SURFACES`` names the surfaces once, and both
the access and the capture sections derive their per-surface defaults from it, so a new
surface is added in one place instead of three.

Every flag here opens something, so they all parse fail-CLOSED through ``_expose_flag``.

Deliberately NO ``from __future__ import annotations``: ``config/schema.py`` resolves a
STRING annotation by ``eval``-ing it in ``config.loader``'s namespace with a silent
``except: return str`` fallback, so postponed annotations here would degrade this file's
schema types to ``string`` without any error. Real type objects cannot take that path.

    get set?" can.

    A sub-section that is not a dict — `mcp: true`, or a stray string — yields ``{}`` and
