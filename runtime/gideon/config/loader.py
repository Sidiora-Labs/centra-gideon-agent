"""Configuration loader for Gideon.

Config location: ~/.gideon/config.json (overridden by GIDEON_HOME)
Credentials:    ~/.gideon/.env (overridden by GIDEON_HOME)

Supports session timeouts, hook rules, and dashboard port via the config
file. The native in-process loop is the default agent runtime; ACP
(``acp:<cli>``) is the opt-in external-CLI backend.

WHERE THE SECTIONS LIVE (PHF-14). This file owns ``AppConfig`` — the load mapping, the
``to_dict()`` serializer and the path helpers (``config_dir``, ``config_path``, ``env_path``,
``workspace_root``) — but no longer declares every section. Cohesive per-domain sections were
extracted to siblings when the file reached 5652 lines against an absolute 6000-line ceiling
(``scripts/generate_structural_baseline.py``):

* ``config/coercion.py`` — ``_meta`` and the value coercers. The LEAF: it imports nothing from
  Gideon, which is what lets the sections below depend on it without a cycle back here.
* ``config/validation.py`` — the JSON-Schema pass over raw ``config.json`` data.
* ``config/safety.py`` — egress, budget, breaker, autonomy, guardrails, auth, security, sandbox.
* ``config/learning.py`` — loops, learning, feedback, planning, evals, proactive.
* ``config/external_access.py`` — the external-access and capture surfaces.

There is NO re-export shim: importers were updated in the same change, and the names imported
below are imported because ``AppConfig`` actually uses them. ``AppConfig`` and its load mapping
must STAY here — ``harness/scanner.py`` and
``scripts/generate_inert_surface_baseline.py`` anchor the config-inertness detectors on finding
them in this file, and ~290 tests monkeypatch ``"gideon.config.loader.config_dir"`` and its
siblings by string. Adding a new section? Put it in the matching sibling (or a new one) and map it
in ``load()`` here; ``tests/test_config_section_modules.py`` checks that seam.
