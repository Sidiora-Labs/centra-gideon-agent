"""Config migrations — the one place a pending config upgrade is APPLIED, and the
one place it is PERSISTED.

Two functions, deliberately separated (PHF-15):

* :func:`apply_config_migrations` mutates a parsed :class:`AppConfig` **in memory** and
  reports whether anything changed. ``AppConfig.load()`` calls it, so every reader gets a
  config of the current shape.
* :func:`load_and_persist_migrations` is the only caller that writes. It is invoked from
  the gateway's own boot path (``cli_server._boot_config``).

Why the split exists at all. ``AppConfig.load()`` used to back the file up with
``shutil.copy2`` and call ``cfg.save()`` inline, which made a *read* of the config a
*write* of the user's ``config.json``. That is not a theoretical hazard: it reached the
real ``~/.gideon/config.json`` on CI, from a module-level constant resolved during
pytest **collection** — before any fixture exists to redirect the home. It was invisible
on developer machines because the write only fires when ``config.json`` exists *and* is
pre-migration, and a developer's own config is already migrated. And it under-reported,
because ``copy2`` preserves the source mtime, so the ``.bak`` looked older than the run.

The migration itself is unchanged and still load-bearing for real upgrades; only the
decision of *who may write* moved here.
