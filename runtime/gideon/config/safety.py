"""Config sections for the safety and trust surface: what the system may do unattended.

One domain, eight sections, and they are grouped because they are read together: an
autonomy decision consults its guardrails, a guardrail consults its budget and its breaker,
and the egress/auth/sandbox trio decides what the process may reach at all.

Fail-safe polarity is the invariant this file exists to keep visible — guard-class flags
resolve through ``_guard_flag`` (ambiguity ⇒ enabled) and exposure-class flags through
``_expose_flag`` (ambiguity ⇒ off). Mixing them is the defect; they are one import apart
here on purpose.

Deliberately NO ``from __future__ import annotations``: ``config/schema.py`` resolves a
STRING annotation by ``eval``-ing it in ``config.loader``'s namespace with a silent
``except: return str`` fallback, so postponed annotations here would degrade this file's
schema types to ``string`` without any error. Real type objects cannot take that path.
