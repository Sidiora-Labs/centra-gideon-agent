"""Natural voice — an owner-facing control for plainer, less machine-sounding prose.

The owner can ask for prose that reads like a person wrote it without editing a
prompt. The control exists at two scopes:

* **per-conversation**, set from the chat composer, and
* **on an agent definition** (``AgentProfile.natural_voice`` /
  ``AgentDefinition.natural_voice``), so it travels with that agent wherever the
  agent is used.

The resolution order between them is stated exactly once, in
:data:`NATURAL_VOICE_PRECEDENCE`, and :func:`resolve` is a loop over that tuple.
Nothing else in the codebase — no docstring, no test, no frontend — restates it;
callers that need to explain the order to a user read the tuple.

Naming: the field is ``natural_voice`` and deliberately **not** ``voice``.
``AgentProfile.voice`` already means the persona ("WHO the agent is — tone,
opinions, bluntness, persona") and ``voice_profiles`` already means SPEECH
(MULTIMODAL-IO), so a third meaning on that one word would collide with two
shipped surfaces at once.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVE — a post-hoc rewriting pass
------------------------------------------------
The obvious other implementation is to let the model answer normally and then
send its answer back through a second call that rewrites it into plainer prose.
That was considered and rejected, for three reasons in increasing order of
seriousness:

1. It is slower. The user waits for two round trips to read one answer, and the
   second one cannot start until the first has finished streaming — so the
   latency is additive on exactly the surface where latency is felt most.
2. It costs twice. Every toggled-on turn pays a second full model call over the
   whole reply, for a change that is purely stylistic.
3. **It can change meaning.** A rewriting pass is a model editing text it did
   not reason about, with no access to the reasoning behind it. That is precisely
   the operation that drops a qualifier, softens a refusal into a hedge, or turns
   "this deletes the branch" into "this cleans up the branch". A style control
   must not be able to alter a fact or weaken a refusal, and a second model call
   over the output is a mechanism that can do both.

So the instruction is a **persona-layer instruction** instead, injected the same
way PT-1 injects a theme's persona: a bundled, user-editable prompt snippet
appended to the turn the model sees. One call, one meaning, and the model applies
the style while it composes rather than having it applied to it afterwards.

# ─────────────────────────── the resolution order ───────────────────────────

#: The scopes that can state a natural-voice preference, MOST specific first.
#:
#: This tuple is the single statement of the resolution order. :func:`resolve`
#: walks it in order and returns the first scope that states a value, so the
#: order is not described anywhere — it is executed. Reordering this tuple
#: changes the behaviour, which is what makes the rails that read it real.
#:
#: * ``conversation`` — what the composer set for THIS conversation. It wins, and
#:   only for this conversation: it is stored on the session, never written back
#:   to the agent definition, so overriding an agent here never edits that agent.
#: * ``agent`` — what the bound agent's definition carries, so a preference
#:   travels with the agent into every conversation that binds it.
#: * ``platform`` — the shipped floor. Always states a value, which is what makes
#:   the walk total.

#: The per-conversation control is a TRI-state, not a bool. ``""`` means "this

#: OFF for an agent whose definition turns it on. A closed map: the value arrives
#: from a client, and anything unrecognised reads as "states nothing".
