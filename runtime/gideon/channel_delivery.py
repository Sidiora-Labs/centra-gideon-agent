"""ChannelDelivery — the outbound handle the gateway uses to deliver results.

The gateway delivers cron/heartbeat/subagent results and interactive approval
prompts to whatever channel a session came from. That delivery is
channel-specific (Slack renders mrkdwn + Block Kit ack buttons + threads), so the
rendering lives in the channel's own bundle, not core. The gateway holds an
optional :class:`ChannelDelivery` handle — registered by the active channel
transport at boot (``start_inbound``) — and calls these high-level methods with
PLAIN text + structured intent; the implementation renders channel-specifically.

When no channel is configured the handle is ``None`` and the gateway delivers to
the dashboard only. This is the outbound half of the core↔channel seam
(:class:`~gideon.gateway_services.GatewayServices` is the inbound half).

        ``on_prompted`` hook (invoked with the pending record) when provided by the
        caller. ``sessions`` is the live SessionManager for cross-surface reconcile.

        **The approval brief (additive meta).** ``event.tool_meta`` carries the core-

        Reading it is OPTIONAL and purely additive: the method's arguments are
        unchanged, no existing field or ``tool_meta`` key is replaced, and a channel
        that ignores the key prompts exactly as it did before. Two rules for a
        renderer:

        * ``blastRadius``/``blastRadiusLine`` are ABSENT when nothing could be
          established — show no blast-radius line at all, rather than "nothing
          established", which reads as "nothing happens";
        * every facet is a POSITIVE claim, so render only the ``True`` ones. Never
          enumerate all four with on/off states: a ``False`` means "not established",
          and painting it as "no network" turns absence of evidence into an all-clear.

        The brief is a compact summary for a surface with no room — the dashboard
        remains the rich approval surface, and rendering logic stays in the channel's
        own bundle."""
