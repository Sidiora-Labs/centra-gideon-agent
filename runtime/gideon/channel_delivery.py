"""ChannelDelivery — the outbound handle the gateway uses to deliver results.

The gateway delivers cron/heartbeat/subagent results and interactive approval
prompts to whatever channel a session came from. That delivery is
channel-specific (Slack renders mrkdwn + Block Kit ack buttons + threads), so the
rendering lives in the channel's own bundle, not core. Each channel transport registers its
handle at boot (``start_inbound``) and core calls these high-level methods with PLAIN text +
structured intent; the implementation renders channel-specifically.

When no channel is configured nothing is registered and the gateway delivers to
the dashboard only. This is the outbound half of the core↔channel seam
(:class:`~gideon.gateway_services.GatewayServices` is the inbound half).

**One handle PER PROVIDER — see the registry at the bottom of this module.** A single shared
handle was the shape until #959: with Discord, Slack and Telegram all connected, each
transport wrote the same slot, so the last registration won (apps load alphabetically, so
always Telegram) and every outbound reply went to that one provider carrying another
provider's channel id.

          established", which reads as "nothing happens";
        * every facet is a POSITIVE claim, so render only the ``True`` ones. Never
          enumerate all four with on/off states: a ``False`` means "not established",
          and painting it as "no network" turns absence of evidence into an all-clear.

        The brief is a compact summary for a surface with no room — the dashboard
        remains the rich approval surface, and rendering logic stays in the channel's
        own bundle."""
