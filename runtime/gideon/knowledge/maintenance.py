"""The deferred graph-maintenance host: a dirty watermark, a due rule, and one pass.

KL-14. Three maintenance jobs already document a cadence and none has one: the memory
lint, knowledge consolidation, and the chunk backfill — which ran from a *boot hook*, so on
a gateway that stays up for a week it never ran again. Each therefore only happened when a
human opened a panel. This module is the host that gives them a cadence, and the reason it
is a watermark rather than a queue is the shape of the work: graph maintenance is
idempotent and set-based, so "something changed since I last ran" is the whole input.

**Why a watermark and not inline work.** An index-affecting write doing its graph pass
inline makes a bulk import of N items perform N passes, each superseded by the next. The
watermark collapses that to one: every write moves a stamp, and the pass runs once when the
writes stop.

**Two stamps, not one, and the second one is the anti-starvation rule.** `dirty_since` is
when the FIRST write after the last clean landed; `dirty_ts` is the LATEST. Due-ness reads
`dirty_since` — the age of the oldest unprocessed dirt — because a busy pipeline's newest
write is always recent, so a rule written against `dirty_ts` would defer forever exactly
when there is most to do. `dirty_ts` is instead the snapshot boundary (below). One stamp
cannot be both: this was the first thing I got wrong.

**The snapshot is what stops a mid-run write being swallowed.** `execute` reads `dirty_ts`
BEFORE running and clears only up to that value. A write landing while the pass runs moves
`dirty_ts` past the snapshot, so the state stays dirty and the next tick picks it up. The
alternative — clearing to "now" at the end — silently discards every write that arrived
during the pass, and nothing downstream could tell.

**It does NOT inherit `durability.auto_backup`.** The host rides the durability tick because
that loop already exists and the alternative is a second one — `gateway.py`'s own rule about
one dispatch path rather than two that drift. But the durability loop gates its jobs on
`durability.auto_backup`, and a user turning off scheduled backups must not silently also
turn off graph maintenance: they mitigate unrelated failures. So the tick calls
`run_maintenance` outside that gate, and `test_maintenance_runs_with_auto_backup_off` is the
proof rather than the intention.
