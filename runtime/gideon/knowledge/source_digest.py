"""The morning digest over watched-source items (WATCHED-SOURCES §6.2 + §8, WS-7).

§6.2's shape, end to end: *clock trigger → foreach over new items since cursor →
rule-grammar filter → ONE digest knowledge item (``note``/``digest``) + inbox notification via
``DashboardState.notify`` → ``notification_allowed()``*. Synthesis is a **background one-shot**
(``one_shot_completion(use_case="background")`` — the reasoning axis, never ``chat``/
``code_tools``, which return the NativeAgentRuntime).

**"Since cursor" is the spool's cursor**, not a timestamp. The engine's
``SourceItemIngested`` records carry a monotonic ``seq`` (:mod:`gideon.knowledge
.source_streams`); the digest reads past its own stored ``seq`` and advances it only after the
knowledge item is durable. So a crash mid-digest re-reads the same window rather than skipping
a day's items, and a double run cannot silently drop the ones it already read.

**This is the LLM boundary, and it is where the fence goes (§8).** Every scraped title and body
is wrapped by the ONE core fence (:func:`gideon.security.fence_untrusted`) with
``source=f"source:{source_id}"`` before it enters the prompt, under a system instruction saying
the fenced spans are data. Two properties make SC#8 hold rather than merely look handled:

1. **Nothing unfenced reaches the model.** The item's text is fenced at the only place it is
   composed, so there is no second path that could forget.
2. **Even a model that obeys the injection cannot act.** The digest's ONLY writes are one
   ``note`` item and one notification; it holds no tool, no action provider and no shell. A
   successful injection can therefore change the digest's *prose* — visible to the user, in a
   note, fenced-provenance intact — and nothing else. That containment is the real defence; the
   fence is what keeps the model from treating the prose as its instructions in the first place.

**Why a module and not a bundled workflow template.** There is no bundled morning-digest
template on ``main`` (grep: no ``templates/`` dir under ``workflows/``, no "morning" template
anywhere), and inventing a template format for one consumer would put the fence inside a
prompt string a user can edit — i.e. a security control a template author could delete. The
handoff is therefore a callable a clock trigger invokes; a template that wants a digest calls
:func:`run_morning_digest`.
