    """A model or transport failure — as distinct from a model that answered nothing.

    🔴 The distinction this type exists to preserve was being destroyed, and three
    complete mechanisms were waiting on it (#759). ``ProviderWorker.send_message``
    caught both ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` and bare ``Exception`` and returned ``""``,
    so ``pool.send`` could not fail — and ``""`` is indistinguishable from a model
    that ran fine and found nothing. Everything downstream reads it as the latter:

    * ``match_intent`` parses ``""``, gets no dict, and returns ``None`` — "not
      relevant". So ``run_intent``'s ``errors`` tally could never leave 0, and the
      UI said "No matches in your existing items" for a cold or timing-out model.
      Its ``raise_on_error=True`` branch was unreachable.
    * ``InsightsExtractor.extract`` has the identical ``raise_on_error`` branch, also
      unreachable. So ``_run_insights`` never returned False, an item was left
      ``done`` rather than ``partial``, and the message the runner already writes —
      "insights: model unavailable (insights not refreshed — try regenerating)" —
      could not be reached.
    * Both call sites carry comments stating a model failure "must be counted as an
      error, not silently folded into 'not relevant'". The swallow defeated them.

    Raising is safe rather than sweeping, because every caller of ``pool.send``
    already handles an exception: ``EntityExtractor.extract`` returns
    ``_empty_result()``, ``LLMPool.send_batch`` catches per item and substitutes
    ``""``, skill synthesis catches and sets ``resp = ""``, and the two
    ``raise_on_error`` callers are the ones asking for it. So the pool stops deciding
    that a failure is an empty answer, and each caller keeps choosing for itself.

    It also makes the two workers agree: ``AcpWorker.send_message`` always propagated,
    so the contract depended on which worker you happened to get.
