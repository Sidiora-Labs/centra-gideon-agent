        """Brute-force cosine similarity over CHUNK vectors *and* whole-item vectors,
        rolled up to one score per item. Returns None if no embedder.

        The return type is deliberately still ``[(item_id, rank)]`` — the fusion contract.
        Chunks are an indexing detail that must not leak into ``_rrf_fuse``: a chunk hit is
        rolled up to its parent item BEFORE ranking, so the fused arm sees exactly the list
        shape it always saw and fusion needs no change at all (KNOWLEDGE-LIBRARY §Risks:
        "do not redesign fusion").

        **Roll-up rule: MAX.** An item's vector score is the single best above-floor
        similarity found for it, across its chunk vectors and its own whole-item vector.
        Max, not mean or sum, because:
        - the question retrieval asks is "does this document contain the answer", which is
          a max over passages — a mean drags a 50-chunk document with one perfect passage
          below a 2-chunk document with two mediocre ones, and a sum simply rewards length
          (the very bias the title boost below exists to counteract in BM25);
        - max is the only aggregate that leaves the score on the *identical* scale as the
          old item-level cosine, so ``_VECTOR_MIN_SIMILARITY`` keeps its calibrated
          meaning. Any averaging aggregate would silently re-scale that threshold, and
          retuning a threshold is out of scope for this task (escalation E6).

        Because the whole-item scan is kept unchanged and merely maxed against the chunk
        scan, an item with no chunk rows (or whose chunks are not embedded yet, mid-backfill)
        contributes only its whole-item vector: the fallback is a *consequence* of the max
        rather than a special case, so a partially-chunked library degrades in ranking
        quality and never loses an item. A chunked item also keeps its title+summary
        signal, which no chunk carries and which the keyword arm can only reach by literal
        term match.

        **KL-11: the scan is a fallback, not the plan.** When ``sqlite-vec`` loads, the chunk
        arm asks a ``vec0`` index for the k nearest chunk vectors and the item arm orders by
        ``vec_distance_cosine``, so neither arm reads every BLOB into Python. Both are pure
        candidate generation — ``_consider`` still scores — so the exact scan and the ANN path
        share one scoring implementation and cannot disagree on a similarity value. When the
        extension cannot load (a SQLite built without loadable extensions), both arms revert to
        the streamed exact scan above: slower on a large library, identical in what it returns,
        announced once at INFO and reported by the Doctor.

        ``chunk_locators`` is an optional sink: when supplied, it is filled with
        ``item_id -> {"section", "line_start", "line_end"}`` for every item whose winning
        signal was a chunk, so ``search`` can cite the passage that actually matched. It is
        an out-parameter rather than part of the return value precisely so the ranked list
        handed to fusion cannot drift.

# ── P12 citation locators ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A retrieval hit gains WHERE-in-the-item its match sits, so a consumer can cite +
# deep-link into the source instead of just naming the document. The result stays
# item-shaped: the locator is derived at read time from the item's own content +
# in-text structural markers the readers already emit (## Slide N / ## {sheet} /
# # headings). Never fabricates structure it can't find — section/line_range stay
# null for a structureless type (image/audio), which is honest, not a guess.
#
# KL-10: when the vector arm's winning evidence for an item was a CHUNK, that chunk's
# own span narrows the search window (and supplies the heading), so a semantic hit no
# longer has to be described by a whole-document term scan. The chunker numbers lines
# 1-based over the very same ``content`` string this function splits, so the spans are
# directly comparable.
