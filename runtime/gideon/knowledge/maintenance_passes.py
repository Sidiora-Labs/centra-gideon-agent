"""Register the standing maintenance jobs on KL-14's host.

Three jobs documented a cadence and had none. Before this module the memory lint ran only
when someone opened the Health panel, knowledge consolidation only when an action dispatched
it, and the chunk backfill only at gateway boot. Each is idempotent and set-shaped, which is
exactly what a watermark-triggered host is for.

**Registration is a separate module from the host on purpose.** `maintenance.py` must be
importable by the write path — `store.py` calls `mark_dirty` on every index-affecting write
— and if the host imported the jobs, every knowledge write would drag in the memory service,
the consolidation planner and an action-provider module. So the host knows nothing about its
passes and this module is imported once, at gateway startup, where paying for those imports
is already the cost of being a gateway.

**What is NOT registered here, and why (KL-14 clause 7 is therefore PARTIAL).** The clause
names "the graph linker backfill" as the third job. There is no such callable: measured with
`grep -rn "def .*backfill" src/gideon/knowledge/` the only backfills are
`chunk_backfill.backfill_item_chunks` (KL-12, registered by the boot-hook replacement),
`store.backfill_entity_description` (a one-entity setter, not a pass) and
`artifact_ingest.ArtifactIngest.backfill`. The nearest thing to a linker pass is
`action_providers/knowledge_maintain_provider._reindex` / `_wikilink_mentions`, both PRIVATE
helpers inside an action provider and neither a resumable whole-library sweep. Registering a
private helper across a module boundary, or inventing a public linker backfill, would be a
different atom's design decision made silently here — so the clause is recorded unmet with
this evidence instead.
