"""Register the standing maintenance jobs on KL-14's host.

Three jobs documented a cadence and had none. Before this module the memory lint ran only
when someone opened the Health panel, knowledge consolidation only when an action dispatched
it, and the chunk backfill only at gateway boot. Each is idempotent and set-shaped, which is
exactly what a watermark-triggered host is for.

**Registration is a separate module from the host on purpose.** `maintenance.py` must be
importable by the write path — `store.py` calls `mark_dirty` on every index-affecting write
— and if the host imported the jobs, every knowledge write would drag in the memory service,
the consolidation planner and an action-provider module. So the host knows nothing about its
passes and this module is imported once, at gateway startup, where paying for those imports
is already the cost of being a gateway.

**All three of clause 7's named jobs are now registered.** An earlier revision of this module
recorded the third one — "the graph linker backfill" — as having no callable, which was true
when measured: the only backfills were `chunk_backfill.backfill_item_chunks`,
`store.backfill_entity_description` (a one-entity setter) and `ArtifactIngest.backfill`, and the
nearest linker was a PRIVATE helper inside an action provider. Rather than register a private
helper across a module boundary, the public pass was built: `knowledge/link_backfill.py`.

**The one pass here that is genuinely RESUMABLE is the linker backfill**, and it is the only
one registered `batched=True`. The distinction is not cosmetic — see `MaintenancePass.batched`.
The lint and the consolidation sweep both return a REPORT (findings, clusters), so a host
reading that as remaining work would re-run them once per allowed sub-batch forever. The
linker backfill returns ITEMS PROCESSED and 0 when the backlog is drained, which is the
contract the sub-batch loop is written against.

**What is still deliberately not done: consolidation does not APPLY.** It runs through the real
gated executor in dry-run. `_apply` writes a model-authored summary and then archives every
input item, and putting that on an unattended cadence is an autonomy decision this atom does
not own — workspace guidance orders Autonomy Guardrails before any unattended-execution work.
See `run_consolidation_pass` for the full statement; what changed here is that the min-hours
and min-cluster gates now bind on a cadence instead of only when a human opens a panel.
