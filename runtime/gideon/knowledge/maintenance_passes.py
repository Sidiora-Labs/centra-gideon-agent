"""Register the standing maintenance jobs on KL-14's host.

Three jobs documented a cadence and had none. Before this module the memory lint ran only
when someone opened the Health panel, knowledge consolidation only when an action dispatched
it, and the chunk backfill only at gateway boot. Each is idempotent and set-shaped, which is
exactly what a watermark-triggered host is for.

**Registration is a separate module from the host on purpose.** `maintenance.py` must be
importable by the write path — `store.py` calls `mark_dirty` on every index-affecting write
— and if the host imported the jobs, every knowledge write would drag in the memory service,
the consolidation planner and an action-provider module. So the host knows nothing about its
passes and this module is imported once, at gateway startup, where paying for those imports
is already the cost of being a gateway.

**KL-19 added a fifth pass: `derived_refresh`.** The structural editing verbs invalidate the
chunk layer and the whole-item vector of every item they touch (a split whose halves keep the
parent's vectors is silently wrong), and something has to rebuild them on a cadence. Before it
the chunk backfill ran only at gateway boot and nothing at all drained a NULLed item vector, so
"refreshed through the maintenance host" would have meant "refreshed at the next restart".

**All three of clause 7's named jobs are now registered.** An earlier revision of this module
recorded the third one — "the graph linker backfill" — as having no callable, which was true
when measured: the only backfills were `chunk_backfill.backfill_item_chunks`,
`store.backfill_entity_description` (a one-entity setter) and `ArtifactIngest.backfill`, and the
nearest linker was a PRIVATE helper inside an action provider. Rather than register a private
helper across a module boundary, the public pass was built: `knowledge/link_backfill.py`.

**Three of the five passes here are genuinely RESUMABLE** — the linker backfill, the
similarity-edge pass and KL-19's derived refresh — and only those three are registered
`batched=True`. The distinction is not cosmetic — see `MaintenancePass.batched`. The lint and
the consolidation sweep both return a REPORT (findings, clusters), so a host reading that as
remaining work would re-run them once per allowed sub-batch forever. The three backfills
return WORK DONE and 0 when the backlog is drained, which is the contract the sub-batch loop
is written against.

**KL-13's similarity-edge pass is hosted here for the reason the clause names: "never inline
on the write path."** Similarity is the most expensive graph work in the store — it compares a
new item against the library — and it is exactly the shape that tempts an inline call at
`create_typed_item`. Inline, a bulk import of N items does N passes, each superseded by the
next, while holding the write lock. Registered here it inherits the watermark's coalescing (N
writes, one pass) and the sub-batch loop's bounded claims. Nothing in `store.py` calls it; the
write path's only obligation is the `mark_dirty` it already performs.

**What is still deliberately not done: consolidation does not APPLY.** It runs through the real
gated executor in dry-run. `_apply` writes a model-authored summary and then archives every
input item, and putting that on an unattended cadence is an autonomy decision this atom does
not own — workspace guidance orders Autonomy Guardrails before any unattended-execution work.
See `run_consolidation_pass` for the full statement; what changed here is that the min-hours
and min-cluster gates now bind on a cadence instead of only when a human opens a panel.
