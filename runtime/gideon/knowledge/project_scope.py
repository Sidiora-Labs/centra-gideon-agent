"""Project scoping for knowledge items (WORK-CONTAINERS §1.6).

Knowledge is ONE global library by design — a project is a **tag plus item metadata**, never
a second database (`session_brief.project_tag` states the same boundary). What §1.6 adds is
provenance and a container filter for the items a RUN writes:

* ``project_id`` — the container the item was produced in. An ordering/scoping key: it is
  what makes a project's brief and its Knowledge view able to ask "what did work on THIS
  project leave behind".
* ``run_id`` — the producing run, so an item is traceable back to the work that wrote it.
* ``sharing_policy`` — ``private`` | ``shared``, the **cross-container surfacing filter**:
  a project's view shows its own items whatever their policy, and another project's items
  only when they are ``shared``.

The default is ``private`` (:data:`DEFAULT_SHARING_POLICY`) deliberately: a run that forgets
to declare a policy must not leak what it wrote into every other project's view. The safe
direction for an un-declared value is "stays home", and widening later is a one-field edit
while un-leaking is not.

The enum is CLOSED. Every consumer enumerates both members explicitly and raises on an
unhandled one — a silent default branch here would turn a future third policy into
"whatever the last reader assumed", which is how a privacy filter becomes decorative.
