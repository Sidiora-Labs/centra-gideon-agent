"""ANN index over chunk vectors — ``sqlite-vec`` living inside the knowledge DB (H1.4).

WHY THIS EXISTS. KL-10 made the vector arm score CHUNK vectors as well as whole-item
vectors, which is what lets retrieval reach page 12 of a long document. It also made the
arm's row count grow from N items to roughly N·(1 + content_chars/1500), and that cost was
measured: at 384 dimensions the pure-Python cosine scan runs ~21 µs/row, so 300 rows cost
6.4 ms/query, 1,800 rows cost 39.1 ms/query, and a 5,000-item library (~30,000 rows) costs
roughly 650 ms/query — user-visible latency on every search. KL-10's execution log raised
this task from optimization to required follow-on.

WHAT THIS IS. A ``vec0`` virtual table (from the ``sqlite-vec`` extension) over the chunk
vectors, in the SAME database file as the ``chunks`` rows it indexes — the shape the owner's
dependency ruling asked for, so a chunk write and its vector write cannot drift into a
sidecar's split brain. The index is a **candidate generator only**: it narrows the corpus to
the k nearest chunk vectors, and ``HybridRetriever`` then re-scores those candidates with the
unchanged Python cosine, the unchanged dimension guard, and the unchanged
``_VECTOR_MIN_SIMILARITY`` floor. Scoring identity is deliberate — it means the only way ANN
can differ from the exact scan is by truncating candidates, which is one testable failure mode
instead of a second scoring implementation that can silently disagree in the last decimal.

HONEST NAMING. ``sqlite-vec`` 0.1.x's ``vec0`` KNN is an exhaustive SIMD scan in C, not a
graph/IVF index, so the request path is still linear in row count — just with a ~280x smaller
constant (measured: 1,800 rows 37.7 ms → 0.16 ms; 30,000 rows 633 ms → 2.3 ms). It is called
an ANN index here because that is the plan's term and the seam is the one an approximate index
would occupy; when ``sqlite-vec`` gains a partitioned/graph index the seam does not move.

STALENESS. Silent staleness is the same silent-recall defect in another costume, so it is
handled in three layers rather than assumed away:

1. **Write-through.** The store's three chunk write sites (``replace_chunks``,
   ``clear_chunks``, ``_delete_item_cascade``) maintain the index on the same connection,
   immediately adjacent to the chunk write.
2. **Reconciliation, once per process.** The first search compares the index's row count
   against the live count of embedded chunks at that dimension and rebuilds on a mismatch
   (measured at 182 ms for 30,000 rows), logging the rebuild. This repairs a database written
   before this index existed, or written by a process where the extension would not load.
3. **Harmless extras.** A candidate id that no longer joins to a live, active chunk row is
   simply dropped by the reader, and the reader escalates ``k`` when the surviving candidate
   set is too small — so stale-EXTRA entries cost nothing but a candidate slot, and even that
   is compensated.

The residual gap is stated rather than hidden: equal row counts with different *contents*
(an unmaintained delete paired with an unmaintained insert) would pass the reconciliation.
Detecting that needs a full content scan, which is the exact cost this index removes. The
Doctor probe therefore reports index coverage so drift is visible, not inferred.

DIMENSION. One index table per embedding dimension (``chunk_vec_384``), so a half-re-embedded
library keeps one self-consistent index per model instead of one index that lies about both.
This matches the reader's dimension guard exactly: a vector whose dimension differs from the
active query vector is unscoreable either way.

FAIL SOFT, NEVER CLOSED. SQLite extension loading depends on how the interpreter's SQLite was
built. Every entry point here degrades to "no index" and lets the caller keep its existing
exact scan; nothing in this module raises into a search. The unavailability reason is logged
ONCE at INFO (the probe is cached) and surfaced as a Doctor capability line.
