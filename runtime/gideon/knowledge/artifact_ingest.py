"""Artifacts as an indexed knowledge source (PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY §6).

Content-bearing artifacts are mirrored into the knowledge library so they are FOUND by a
search — and are deliberately never LISTED as knowledge items. An artifact already has a
home (the Artifacts library, its versions, its deploy route); a second copy of it standing
alongside the user's notes would double every count and every list. What was missing is
retrieval: an answer written into an artifact last month was unreachable from the one place
a user looks for what they know.

**This joins the WatchedSource mechanism rather than paralleling it.** The mirror rides the
same four primitives every watched feed and watched directory uses:

* one row in ``sources`` (``provider='artifacts'``, ``kind='artifact'``,
  ``spec={'uri': 'artifact://'}``) — so the mirror appears in the Sources UI, and its
  ``enrichment`` is what :func:`~gideon.knowledge.pipeline.runner.ingest_item`
  already consults;
* per-artifact identity as the store's own ``(source_id, guid)`` pair, guid = the artifact
  slug — which is what makes "replace this artifact's mirror, touch nothing else" a
  single-row lookup (:meth:`~gideon.knowledge.store.KnowledgeStore.find_source_item`)
  instead of a scan plus a heuristic;
* the ONE ingestion path, ``ingest_queue.enqueue`` — never a hand-written FTS row. An
  ``items`` row inserted without its ``items_fts`` row is invisible to search while looking
  perfectly present in the table, so the writer is always
  :meth:`~gideon.knowledge.store.KnowledgeStore.create_typed_item` /
  :meth:`~gideon.knowledge.store.KnowledgeStore.update_item`;
* the shared reader conversion (:func:`~gideon.knowledge.readers.html_to_prose`) via
  a kind→extension map, so an ``html`` artifact reduces to the same prose an uploaded
  ``.html`` file does.

**Three decisions worth naming.**

1. **Enrichment is RAW, not full.** The mirror is automatic and on by default, so a home
   with 300 artifacts would otherwise spend 300 model calls the user never asked for the
   first time the gateway starts. ``raw`` routes every mirror through the LLM-free graph
   (``FeedItemGraph``) — indexed and embedded locally, never sent to a model — and the
   Sources UI already reads that field back as a "no AI" chip.

2. **A delete FORGETS the sighting** (``KnowledgeStore.forget_source_item``)
   where a watched directory archives it. A vanished file may be back tomorrow and its
   library row is the last copy; a deleted artifact is gone from the store we own, so an
   archived mirror would be an orphan nothing can revive — and leaving the ``source_seen``
   row would make a re-created slug permanently unindexable.

3. **Idempotence is a content hash, not a timestamp.** Every mirror carries
   ``file_metadata['artifact_sha']`` over exactly the title + text it indexed. Re-running
   the whole backfill, or a metadata PATCH that changed nothing observable, therefore
   writes nothing and enqueues nothing. A timestamp comparison would have re-embedded the
   library on every restart.
