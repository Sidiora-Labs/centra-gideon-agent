"""SourceEngine — the one poll loop over WatchedSources (WATCHED-SOURCES §1.2).

The generalized form of the loop ``triggers/web_poll.py`` prefigured for one kind: a
SINGLE re-armed asyncio task (never one task per source) that wakes, polls every source
whose interval has elapsed, and sleeps until the next is due (capped, like the trigger
scheduler, so an external edit is picked up within one poll). It enrolls the poll-capable
providers registered in ``knowledge_providers.registry`` — a provider is poll-capable when
it subclasses :class:`~gideon.knowledge_providers.base.KnowledgeSourceProvider` (the
``poll`` contract, §1.1) — and drives ``provider.poll(source_id, cursor)`` per due source.

Crash-safety is the whole design (SC#4). Per new item the engine calls the source-aware
:meth:`~gideon.knowledge.store.KnowledgeStore.create_typed_item`, which folds the
``source_seen`` novelty-gate INSERT into the item's own transaction, then enqueues it on
the ONE ingestion path (``ingest_queue.enqueue``). Only after every item is committed does
it advance the cursor (:meth:`~gideon.knowledge.store.KnowledgeStore.record_poll`).
So a crash between item-persist and cursor-persist re-yields the same items on the next
poll, and the UNIQUE ``(source_id, guid)`` gate drops them — at-least-once poll, exactly-
once persist. :meth:`recover_pending` on startup re-enqueues any item whose ingestion did
not finish (via the ingest queue's own recovery), so no written-but-unprocessed item is
stranded by a restart.

The engine NEVER fetches web content itself — it drives PROVIDERS, whose fetches route
through ``net.fetch`` under the ``SOURCE`` egress profile (WS-3+). Re-implementing a fetch
here would bypass host classification, private-IP denial and the redirect-hop re-check.
