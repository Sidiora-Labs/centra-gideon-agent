"""The project Session Brief — push-based retrieval into workflow RUNS (KNOW-R12).

A workflow that has to ASK for context gets it only when the template author thought to add a
retrieve node. The Session Brief inverts that: every run in a project starts with a bounded
digest of what the store already knows about that project, including its decision log, so a
resumed or forked run does not re-litigate settled choices.

**Scope guard, and it is load-bearing.** This composes into RUN context ONLY. Gideon has a
deliberate invariant that knowledge is never ambiently injected into CHAT — it enters a chat
session through the composer's @-picker or the agent's `knowledge_search` tool, both of which are
the user asking. Nothing here may be reachable from a chat-context path; a brief that leaked into
chat would silently convert an explicit user action into an ambient one, and the user would have
no way to tell where the context came from.

**Bounded, and honest about it.** A brief that quietly dropped half the decision log would let a
run contradict a decision it was never shown. So the budget is enforced by DROPPING WHOLE ITEMS,
newest and highest-precedence first, and the brief says how many it left out.

**Fenced.** Knowledge items partly derive from web and inbox content, so the brief is untrusted
data. It is composed as fenced blocks with the same doctrine as `fenced_sources`.
