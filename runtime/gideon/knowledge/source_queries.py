"""Saved source queries — a filter over a stream IS a stream (WATCHED-SOURCES §6.4, WS-7).

The FreshRSS lesson: once a user can save a filter over their item stream, that filter becomes
an addressable event source of its own. So a :class:`SavedSourceQuery` is evaluated against
every newly-ingested item and emits ``SourceQueryMatched`` when it matches.

**Zero tokens is the design, not an optimisation.** §6.4: "*Deterministic rule language before
LLM: 90% of triage costs zero tokens.*" This module therefore imports NOTHING from
``llm_helpers``/``providers``, and the grammar below is a hand-rolled matcher over strings —
deliberately small and boring. ``test_watched_sources_queries.py`` pins the claim by making
any LLM entry point explode and asserting a match still happens.

**What is matched, and why not the event payload.** Matching reads the STRUCTURAL record —
title/url/content as the provider emitted them — never the ``SourceItemIngested`` payload,
whose title is fenced (§6.1: "*payload content never participates in pattern matching*"). A
fenced string is not matchable: ``intitle:release`` would have to see through
``<untrusted_content …>`` markers, and a matcher that strips a fence to look inside it is a
fence-break with extra steps.

**The trigger seam is the EXISTING one.** A match fires through
``trigger_sources.registry.emit`` — the single app-source ingestion point — which namespaces
the event to ``app:watched-sources:SourceQueryMatched``, fences its text at origin and hands
it to ``event_triggers.emit_event``. A user subscribes with an ordinary ``AppEvent``/``event``
trigger whose ``event_glob`` matches that name. §6.4 describes the subscription as
``{source: SourceQueryMatched, pattern: {query_id}}``; the SHIPPED matcher's ``source`` is one
of three enum values (``memory``/``inbox``/``app``) and its pattern kinds are a closed set, so
the plan's literal shape would require a FOURTH event source — a second matcher for one
producer, which the substrate's own amendment forbids ("no new trigger kind, no second
matcher"). The query id rides ``meta.query_id`` instead, which is where the inbox bridge puts
its ``sender``/``address`` for exactly the same reason.
