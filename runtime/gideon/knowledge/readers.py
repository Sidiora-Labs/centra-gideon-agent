#: Two glyph baselines within this many points are treated as the same visual line.
#: PDF writers jitter the `top` of glyphs on one line by fractions of a point (and
#: rounding to whole points would merge two lines of a tightly-leaded paper), so the
#: grouping needs a tolerance rather than an equality test.

#: Deliberately NOT in `slicing.py`'s single threshold block: this is a fact about PDF
#: glyph layout — what counts as one visual LINE — and belongs to whoever reads the PDF.
#: `slicing.py` imports from here, so hosting it there would invert the dependency; and
#: §5's one-block rule exists for the DETECTION thresholds (heading ratio, kept pages,
#: slice fractions) that drifted from their documentation, none of which live here.
