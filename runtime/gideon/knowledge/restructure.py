"""KL-19 -- the structural editing verbs, so the knowledge base stops being read-mostly.

A reader who notices that one note is really three, or that two are really one, could
previously do nothing about it from the surface where they noticed. The library offered
create, edit-body and delete; every STRUCTURAL change -- split, merge, extract, retitle,
move, re-kind -- was either impossible or a hand-rolled copy-paste that silently dropped
everything the store knew about the item.

**Why these are store verbs and not UI sugar.** Each one has to preserve three things a
copy-paste cannot:

1. **Provenance** -- the child of a split inherits its parent's `url`, `provider` and
   `kind`, and is LINKED to it by a real `part_of` edge, so "where did this come from" still
   has an answer. It deliberately does NOT inherit `source_id`/`guid`: those are a watched
   source's exactly-once persist key under a partial UNIQUE index, and copying them would
   either collide or make the child look like a second sighting of the parent's feed entry.
2. **Chunk lineage** -- the chunk layer and both vector arms are derived from body text. The
   moment a verb rewrites a body they are wrong, so every verb invalidates them for the items
   it touched and KL-14's maintenance host rebuilds them (`maintenance_passes.derived_refresh`).
   A split whose halves keep the parent's vectors is silently wrong: it searches, it returns
   results, and the results are about text that is no longer there.
3. **Inbound relations** -- citations naming the item as a source, typed item relations on
   either leg, collection memberships, reading highlights, and `[[Title]]` wikilinks in other
   items' prose. `store.inbound_references` enumerates them; each verb decides which of them
   its particular change would BREAK.

**Two-phase by construction.** `plan()` touches nothing and returns a token; `apply()` refuses
any token that is not the one `plan()` would issue right now. The token is a digest of the
verb, its parameters, the affected items' current state AND the break set the user was shown --
copying `api_durability_history_operate`, which binds a confirm to both the state it previewed
(`expected_head`) and the selection it described (`expected_paths`). Nothing is minted and
nothing expires: a preview is valid exactly as long as what it describes has not moved. This is
what makes "states what it would break BEFORE applying" true by construction rather than by
the frontend remembering to ask first.

**Idempotence under a doubled submit** falls out of the same digest. The token is the undo
journal's primary key, so a second confirm carrying the same token finds the applied record and
REPLAYS its result instead of restructuring again. That ordering is load-bearing: the journal is
consulted BEFORE the plan is re-derived, because after a successful split the parent's body no
longer contains the offsets the plan validated and re-deriving first would raise a confusing
refusal for what is really a duplicate request.

**Undo** restores through `store.restore_items_snapshot`, which puts the item rows, their tags,
memberships, mentions, highlights, relations and citations back inside one transaction -- and
then invalidates the derived layer again, because the reverse direction has exactly the same
staleness problem as the forward one.
