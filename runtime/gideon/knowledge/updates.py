"""ONE updater for a knowledge item: propose, then accept.

WF2KNO-11 clause B. An update to an existing knowledge item runs as a PROPOSAL the owner
inspects and accepts or dismisses, so generated prose never silently overwrites human
writing. The plain "just update it" path is the SAME path with the acceptance folded in —
``auto_accept=True`` files the proposal and immediately accepts it — rather than a second
function that writes to the row directly.

That second function is exactly the drift this atom removes. A direct-write update sitting
beside a propose-an-update is two code paths over one row: the queue's decision memory, its
fingerprint dedup, its inbox surfacing and its audit trail all attach to one of them, and
every caller then silently picks which of those guarantees it gets. So there is no direct
writer in here. The ONLY way proposed content reaches the store is
:func:`gideon.learning.proposals.accept`'s installer, which is why ``auto_accept`` is
a parameter of the propose call and not a branch around the queue.

The write itself goes through :meth:`~gideon.knowledge.store.KnowledgeStore.
update_item` — the store's own writer, FTS sync included. This module holds no SQL and no
second upsert, and it does not re-implement validation either: ``semantics.check_persist``
is the single validation entry point and is called before anything is queued.

:func:`regenerate_synthesis` sits ON TOP of that one updater rather than beside it: it
recomputes a synthesized item from the sources the item itself cites and hands the result to
:func:`propose_update`. The recompute lives here rather than in the dashboard route so the
route cannot grow a second one, and enqueueing through ``propose_update`` is what makes a
regeneration inherit the stored fields, the validation, the identical-to-stored no-op and the
content-hash idempotence instead of re-deciding all four at a second call site.
