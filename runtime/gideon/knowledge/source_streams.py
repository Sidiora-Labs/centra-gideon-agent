"""Source stream events + the interim JSONL spool (WATCHED-SOURCES §6.1, WS-7).

Three events describe a watched source's life as a stream:

* :data:`SOURCE_ITEM_INGESTED` ``{source_id, item_id, guid, title, url, change}`` — one per
  item the engine (re-)indexed this poll.
* :data:`SOURCE_POLL_COMPLETED` ``{source_id, new_count, escalations, budget_spent}`` — one
  per poll, success or not.
* :data:`SOURCE_QUERY_MATCHED` ``{query_id, item_id}`` — a saved source query matched a
  newly-ingested item (§6.4, :mod:`gideon.knowledge.source_queries`).

**Why a spool and not a bus.** These belong on AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's event bus, which does
not exist yet (verified: no ``event_bus``/``EventBus`` anywhere under ``src/``). The plan's
own dependency note sanctions the interim: "*Pre-bus interim: fires spool to the engine's own
JSONL and drain when the bus lands (the substrate's spool/cursor rule).*" So this file is
deliberately NOT a bus — no subscriber registry, no dispatch, no delivery semantics. It is an
append-only log plus a cursor, which is the smallest thing a bus can later drain. Building
bus machinery here would mint a second mechanism for the substrate to then delete.

**What rides the payload.** Item *content* lives in the knowledge store; the payload carries
at most a fenced title snippet, wrapped by the ONE core fence
(:func:`gideon.security.fence_untrusted`) with ``source=f"source:{source_id}"`` per §8.
A spool record is read back by digest synthesis, which is an LLM boundary — so the snippet is
fenced at WRITE time rather than trusting every future reader to remember. The consequence is
deliberate and load-bearing: **a fenced title is not matchable**, which is exactly §6.1's
"payload content never participates in pattern matching". Saved queries therefore match the
structural record (title/url/content as the provider emitted them), never this payload.
