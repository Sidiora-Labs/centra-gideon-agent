"""Staleness of a SYNTHESIZED knowledge item — the count a "sources changed" banner names.

WF2KNO-11 (KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS, synthesis legibility), clause A. A synthesis is a claim
about a slice of the corpus at one moment. The corpus keeps moving; the document does not.
Serving it unchanged and unmarked is the failure this module exists to prevent — a reader
cannot tell a two-minute-old overview from one written before the three items that
contradict it arrived.

**What "new material" means here.** An item whose ``item_type`` is in
:data:`gideon.knowledge.semantics.SYNTHESIZED_KINDS` is stale when either:

(a) an item it CITES has an ``updated_at`` later than the synthesis' own ``updated_at`` —
    a source it quoted was rewritten underneath it; or
(b) an ACTIVE, non-synthesized item that shares at least one of the synthesis' tags, other
    than the synthesis itself, was created or updated after it — material the synthesis
    would plausibly have drawn on had it existed at the time.

``new_source_items`` is the distinct item count from (b) — the number the banner says out
loud. ``changed_sources`` is (a).

The wrong alternative, and the tempting one because it is one query with no join, is
corpus-wide recency: "anything created since the synthesis". That marks every synthesis
stale within minutes of any unrelated ingest, and a banner that is always lit is a banner
the reader learns to click past — strictly worse than no banner, because it also spends the
user's trust. Tag overlap is the cheapest honest proxy for "would this document have been
written differently", and it is the same signal the synthesizing stage used to pick inputs.

Two smaller choices that are also easy to get wrong:

* The reference stamp is the synthesis' ``updated_at``, never its ``created_at``. Using
  ``created_at`` would leave a just-regenerated document permanently stale: the banner would
  survive the one action it offers.
* (b) excludes synthesized kinds. Two overviews sharing a tag would otherwise hold each
  other stale forever, and regenerating either one would re-stale the other.

**A non-synthesized item is never stale.** :func:`staleness_for` returns ``stale=False``
with both counts zero for a note, fact, bookmark or file, and says so in ``scope``. That is
a deliberate answer, not an unhandled case: "stale" on an OBSERVED item would mean something
else entirely — that the world has moved on from a recorded fact — and its remedy would be
re-fetching the source, not regenerating a document out of the corpus. Answering both
questions under one word would give one banner two jobs.

Timestamps go through :func:`gideon.knowledge.semantics._parse`, the parser the rest
of the knowledge layer already uses, rather than a second hand-rolled one. The store writes
every ``created_at``/``updated_at`` with the same naive-local ``datetime.now().isoformat()``,
so running both sides of every comparison through one coercion is what keeps the ordering
honest.
