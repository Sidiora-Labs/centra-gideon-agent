"""Ingestion runner — orchestrates one item through its node-graph (#30).

Entry point ``ingest_item``: load the item → pick its code-owned graph → execute the
DAG (each node output → the extracted-content pool) → run terminal stages over the

Per-node + per-stage progress is broadcast over per-resource SSE so the detail view

    1. **The deterministic alias pre-pass** (MEMORY-GRAPH §1.3) — every entity the graph
       ALREADY knows whose name or alias literally appears gets a mention. Zero LLM calls,
       and crucially it runs **even when `pool is None`**: without it, a user with no model
       bound ingests a document that plainly names a known entity and gets nothing, because
       the extractor is the only thing that ever linked.
    2. **LLM extraction** — finds what is NEW (entities the graph has never seen, and the
       relations between them), which a string matcher structurally cannot.

    They are complementary, not redundant: the model discovers, the trie guarantees. Both
    write through `add_mention` (`INSERT OR IGNORE`), so an entity both find is one mention.

    Re-runs cleanly: the extraction path clears this item's prior mentions/relations first so
    a re-ingest doesn't dup — and the pre-pass is re-applied after that clear, so its links
    survive the very stage that wipes them.

    Returns the phase to report. Unlike the intents stage, this one is NOT wholly
    model-dependent: pass 1 is the deliberate model-free guarantee, so with no pool the stage
    still ran and linked — ``done``, not ``skipped``. Only a contentless item skips outright;

    """P12 TIER-2 semantic dedup — runs AFTER `_embed` (the vector must exist; it doesn't at
    create time in the create-fast/enrich-async model). Fetches same-type candidates carrying
    an embedding and asks the pure `dedup.resolve_duplicate` (filename + cosine + date-gate) if
    the just-enriched item duplicates one. On a confirmed dup it ARCHIVES the format-recall
    LOSER (never deletes — archived is excluded from retrieval + reversible), which may be the
    NEW item or the existing one. Returns a small verdict dict for the SSE phase, or None when
    nothing fired. Never raises into the pipeline — a dedup fault must not fail an ingest.

    Silently no-ops when the embedder is unavailable (no vector to compare) → behaves exactly
    as pre-P12. TIER-1 exact dedup (URL/byte-hash, create-time in store.py) is unaffected."""
