"""Shared helpers for model-backed pipeline nodes (#47).

A node resolves its model through a Settings>Models **use-case** (via
``resolve_provider_for_use_case``) and runs a one-shot completion. The executor has
already verified the use-case is resolvable (``can_resolve_use_case``) before a
model-backed node runs, so these helpers assume a model exists — but still degrade to
``""`` on any provider error rather than raising (the node then reports failure and
the item goes partial).
