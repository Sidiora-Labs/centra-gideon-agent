"""Fetch-and-slice — the deterministic document-shaping primitive (WATCHED-SOURCES §5).

Four jobs, one module, **zero model calls anywhere in this file**:

1. **Source sniffing** — an arXiv id, a DOI, a raw-PDF URL or a plain URL, normalized to
   one :class:`SourceRef` a fetcher can act on.
2. **Cascaded section detection** — three deterministic strategies over a PDF's layout
   (:func:`~gideon.knowledge.readers.read_pdf_structure`), the first two unioned.
3. **Purpose-cut slices** — ``brief`` / ``body`` / ``meta`` / ``full``, each sized for the
   ROLE that will read it, persisted as ``extracted_contents`` rows on the ONE item.
4. **Deterministic reference extraction** — a four-tier citation cascade over the
   bibliography, identifiers first.

**Determinism is the product, not a nice property.** The same bytes must always yield the
same sections, because everything downstream (which text an enrichment node sees, which
references get stored) is derived from them; a detector that reorders on a different
Python run silently changes what a model was asked about. So: no model calls, no reliance
on dict/set iteration order, every candidate list explicitly sorted by a total key, and
:func:`detect_sections` is a pure function of its argument. The property is asserted by
running detection twice over one input and comparing, which is the only assertion that
can catch an ordering regression.

**Slices are rows, not chunks.** Each slice is one ``extracted_contents`` row on the SAME
item (``node_type: "slice:brief"``). The one-item-one-document model is untouched — the
repo removed chunk-items deliberately and this primitive does not reintroduce them.

**The full text is for deterministic passes only.** ``SliceResult.full_text`` feeds
reference extraction and the kept-pages floor. Nothing here hands it to a model, and the
persisted rows are the shaped slices precisely so an enrichment node receives the slice
its role needs — token control by input shaping, not by asking a prompt to be brief.

# ══ THRESHOLDS ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Every tunable number in this module lives HERE and nowhere else. §5 makes that a
# requirement rather than a style preference, from the paperloom doc-vs-code drift
# lesson: a threshold written inline is a threshold that gets copied, and two copies
# of "1.1" drift the day someone tunes one of them. If you need a number below,
# reference a name from this block — a literal in the code is the defect this exists
# to prevent.

#: A line is a heading candidate when its largest glyph exceeds the body size by this
#: factor. 1.1 rather than something larger because many papers set section headings
#: only slightly above body size (bold does the visual work), and a stricter ratio
#: finds no headings at all in exactly those papers.
HEADING_SIZE_RATIO = 1.1

#: A heading is short. Above this, a large-font run is a pull-quote or a title block
#: spanning lines, not a section heading.
HEADING_MAX_CHARS = 120

#: The kept-pages floor: the first N and last M PRE-BIBLIOGRAPHY pages are always
#: retained in ``body`` even when section detection found nothing in them. A paper's
#: front matter and its closing argument are the two places a missed heading costs the
#: most, so they are guaranteed rather than left to the cascade.
KEEP_FIRST_PAGES = 3
KEEP_LAST_PAGES = 2

#: ``meta`` is the first pages — title block, authors, abstract region.
META_PAGES = 2

#: ``brief`` is clamped into this fraction band of the pre-bibliography text. Below the
#: floor it is topped up from the leading text (a two-line brief is not a brief); above
#: the ceiling it is truncated (a "brief" that is most of the paper defeats its purpose).
BRIEF_MIN_FRACTION = 0.10
BRIEF_MAX_FRACTION = 0.25

#: Two bibliography entries whose titles match at or above this ratio are the same work
#: cited twice in different formats. 0.85 tolerates punctuation/casing/line-wrap damage
#: without merging two genuinely different papers with similar titles.
TITLE_MATCH_RATIO = 0.85

#: The fuzzy-title window slides in steps of this many characters. 1 would be exact and
#: quadratic on a long entry; a small stride keeps the scan bounded while still landing
#: inside a title that starts after an author list of unknown length.
TITLE_WINDOW_STEP_CHARS = 4

#: A title candidate needs at least this many words. Fewer and it is a venue
#: abbreviation or an author initial run, not a title.
TITLE_MIN_WORDS = 4

#: The author+year tier looks for a 4-digit year within this many characters of the
#: entry's start — the proximity that distinguishes "Smith, J. (2019)" from a page
#: range or an arbitrary number deep in the entry.
AUTHOR_YEAR_PROXIMITY_CHARS = 120

#: Shorter than this and a bibliography fragment is line noise, not an entry.
MIN_REFERENCE_CHARS = 20

#: A cap on bibliography entries parsed from one document. A malformed split on a
#: pathological file must cost bounded work, not a pathological loop.
MAX_REFERENCES = 500
