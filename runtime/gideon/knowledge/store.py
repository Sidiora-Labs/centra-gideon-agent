        mechanism — knowledge.db has no schema version to gate on, matching how
        ``_init_schema`` relies on ``IF NOT EXISTS``.

        Three deliberate choices, each guarding a way this could silently lose data:

        1. **A per-row Python parse, not SQL ``json_each``.** ``json_each`` RAISES on a
           malformed value, and malformed values genuinely exist: ``_serialize_item`` has
           always swallowed ``JSONDecodeError``, so the store has tolerated them for the
           column's whole life. SQL would abort the migration (or, wrapped in a bare
           except, drop that item's tags). Parsing here means one bad row costs one
           warning, not everyone's tags.
        2. **Count reconciliation before COMMIT.** Every distinct tag name found must
           exist as a row afterwards; a mismatch rolls back. Once the column is dropped
           the source data is GONE — there is no second attempt, and the pre-1.0 banner
           means no migration safety net either.
        3. **The FTS table is dropped and recreated, never rebuilt.** Its column list is
           fixed at creation and its ``content=`` target changes here (``items`` → the
           ``items_fts_src`` view). Calling ``'rebuild'`` while it still points at the
           dropped column WIPES THE INDEX AND REPORTS SUCCESS — measured, with
           ``integrity-check`` still reporting ok afterwards.

        Uses the same `dedup.resolve_duplicate` scorer as the ingest-time pipeline rather than
        inventing a second notion of "duplicate": the resolver already encodes the real rule
        (filename/title similarity AND cosine AND the same series-date token), and a second
        heuristic here would disagree with the ingest-time dedup in ways nobody could explain.

        🔴 IT DOES **NOT** REUSE `find_fuzzy_dup_candidates`, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS
        METHOD'S SHAPE. That prefilter is `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT ?` — a deliberate,
        correct bound for the INGEST path, where the anchor is the row being ingested right now
        and a bounded Python cosine loop matters. Read on demand for a UI, the same cap silently
        answers a DIFFERENT question: it spends the caller's `limit` on *how many items are even
        looked at*, newest first, so a duplicate that is not among the N newest same-type embedded
        items is never scored at all. Measured on a 32-item library: an exact-title pair scoring
        `is_dup=True`, `filename_sim=1.0`, `cosine=0.9950` returned `[]` at the shipped default
        `limit=25` — and the route caps `limit` at 50, so past ~50 items the panel whose entire job
        is to say "a second copy exists" said "no duplicates" permanently. That is the SECOND
        silent-empty path on this one surface (the first was the `is_duplicate` typo below), and
        both fail the same way: the honest answer and the broken answer are the same empty list.

        So the scan is now bounded by the RULE instead of by recency, in two phases:

        1. The filename leg over the WHOLE eligible corpus — cheap title/path columns only, no
           `LIMIT`, no blob reads. `dedup.filename_similarity` at `dedup.FILENAME_SIM_MIN`, the
           resolver's own metric at the resolver's own number.
        2. Embeddings decoded and cosine scored ONLY for what survives phase 1. This is strictly
           less blob work than before (which decoded up to 25 unconditionally) while being
           unbounded in reach: to be missed now you would need the anchor's own title to be
           <85% similar to the duplicate's, which is exactly the case the rule calls "not a dup".

        `limit` therefore caps RESULTS — what the route and the UI have always meant by it.

        Returns lean dicts (`id`, `title`, `item_type`, `created_at`, `word_count`, `reason`,
        `similarity`, `title_similarity`) — never the embedding, which is megabytes of floats no
        caller needs. Items without an embedding are simply absent: an un-embedded item cannot be
        scored, and guessing from titles alone is how a merge UI proposes destroying two unrelated
        documents.

        it they stay pointed at an id that no longer exists, which the citation table
        deliberately permits and which a caller may legitimately prefer.
