"""Resumable batched chunk backfill for pre-chunking knowledge items (KL-12, H1.5).

Chunking (KL-9), the chunk-level vector arm (KL-10) and its ANN index (KL-11) all only
reach items that HAVE chunks. Every item ingested before KL-9 has none, so on a real
library those three atoms do nothing until this backfill runs. It walks the un-chunked
items in bounded batches, runs each through the ingest path's own chunk-write unit, and
reports progress — the payload is that an existing library becomes searchable by content.

**Resume state is the data, not a cursor.** The backlog is defined by a query
(``store.count_items_missing_chunks`` / ``store.items_missing_chunks``: active,
non-archived, content-bearing, no chunk rows), so an item leaves the backlog the instant its
chunks
land. A killed run therefore resumes simply by asking again — nothing to persist, nothing
to reconcile, and no window in which a crash could strand a cursor that disagrees with the
rows. This is the same idiom as the store's ``count_items_missing_embedding`` boot
auto-resume and the ingest queue's ``recover_pending``, which likewise re-derive their
pending set from the rows rather than remembering it.

**Idempotence.** A completed backfill is a no-op: every item it chunked now fails the
backlog predicate. That matters more than tidiness — re-chunking mints fresh chunk uuids
(see ``store.replace_chunks``), so a careless re-run would churn the ANN index and orphan
rows for no gain.

**Not a re-embed.** The item rows' own whole-item vectors are never touched; that is
``store.reembed_all``'s job, driven by the embedding-model-switch re-index. This backfill
only adds the chunk layer beneath them, which is why a half-backfilled library still
searches: the vector arm falls back to whole-item vectors for items that have no chunks
yet (KL-10), so results degrade in specificity, never to zero.

      ingest chunk unit swallowed a fault, which by design it never raises. They stay in
      the backlog for the next run; the keyset cursor still steps past them within this
