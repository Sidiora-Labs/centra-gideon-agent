"""Item-similarity edges: a resumable kNN pass over the chunk vector index (KL-13).

**What it closes.** The store had no similarity-derived edge of any kind. The chunk vector
index (`KL-11`) was queried at READ time and never materialised into a graph, so every
"related items" surface had to answer the question some other way — in practice an
unthresholded shared-entity COUNT, which ranks two documents as related because they both
happened to mention one common name. This module derives real edges and
`store.similar_items` serves them with a real threshold.

**Where it runs.** On `KL-14`'s deferred maintenance host, never inline on the write path.
Embedding an item's chunks is already the slow part of ingest; adding a kNN sweep over the
whole corpus to it would make every save wait on the library's size. `similarity_pass`
therefore has the host's `batched=True` shape — one bounded batch per call, returning how
many items it claimed so the host can drive it to 0.

**Resume state is the ROWS, not a cursor.** The backlog is a query
(`store.count_items_missing_similarity_sweep` / `store.items_missing_similarity_sweep`), so
an item leaves it the instant its sweep row commits. A killed run resumes by asking again —
nothing to persist and no crash window in which a stranded cursor could disagree with the
data. Same idiom as `link_backfill`, `chunk_backfill` and the ingest queue's
`recover_pending`.

🔴 **Why the backlog is NOT "items with no similarity edges".** That reading looks
equivalent and does not terminate. An item may legitimately have no neighbour above the
cosine floor, so it would never gain an edge, never leave the backlog, and be recomputed on
every tick; because the host re-invokes a batched pass until it returns 0, the head of the
backlog would absorb every sub-batch and the tail would never be reached. This exact defect
was measured on the entity linker (`link_backfill`, KL-14) — drain `[2, 2, 2, 2, ...]`
instead of `[2, 2, 1, 0]`. `item_similarity_edges` records what was FOUND;
`similarity_sweeps` records that the pass LOOKED. The backlog needs the second fact, so the
sweep row is written whether or not any neighbour cleared the floor.

**Known limitation, stated rather than hidden.** A sweep is once-per-item, so an item
ingested LATER does not pull earlier items back into the backlog: the new item's own pass
finds the pair and writes the edge (the edge is symmetric, so one side is enough), but an
earlier item's *stored* score is not refreshed and its top-K is not re-truncated against the
newcomer. Re-chunking an item does re-enter it (`store.replace_chunks` clears the marker),
so the case that actually loses information — an item whose content changed — is covered.
A full re-derivation is `store.clear_similarity_sweep` over the library, which is a
different shape of work.

**Config values are PARAMETERS.** `top_k`, `min_score`, `candidate_multiple` and
`degree_cap` are arguments with module defaults; `_resolve_tuning` is the only place that
reads `AppConfig`, and every field it reads is optional with a documented fallback, so this
module cannot become a live reader of a key nobody writes.

#: connect nearly every pair in the library and the graph would be a hairball. ~0.55 is
#: where "the same topic" starts for the sentence-transformer family the embedder defaults

#: `candidate_multiple` is deliberately NOT config-mapped: the atom round-trips three knobs
#: (floor, top-K, degree cap) and no config field exists for the overfetch, so mapping it
#: would make this a reader of a key nothing ever writes -- the exact shape this area keeps
#: finding. It stays a module constant.
#:
#: The `KnowledgeConfig` field names this pass reads, in ONE mapping so a rename is one
#: edit. Every one is optional: `_resolve_tuning` falls back to the module default and says

#: key if the config field lands under a different name.

    The pipeline, in order:

    1. Read the item's embedded chunk vectors.
    2. Per chunk, ask the ANN index for `top_k * candidate_multiple` nearest chunks — plus
       the item's own chunk count, because a chunk's true nearest neighbours are the OTHER
       CHUNKS OF ITS OWN DOCUMENT (self-similarity ~1.0). Without that headroom a 30-chunk
       document spends its whole candidate budget on itself and finds no neighbour at all.
    3. Score each candidate pair with the store's one cosine (`dedup.cosine_similarity`)
       behind a dimension guard, and drop anything below `min_score` — per pair, before the
       roll-up, so a weak chunk can never become an edge's cited evidence.
    4. **Collapse chunk pairs to item pairs keeping the MAX**, which is the rule the vector
       retrieval arm already uses: the question is "do these two documents share content",
       which is a max over passages. A mean drags a 50-chunk document with one perfect
       passage below a 2-chunk document with two mediocre ones, and a sum just rewards
       length. Max also leaves the score on the identical scale as `min_score`, so the floor
       keeps its calibrated meaning.
    5. Truncate to `top_k` items and upsert in canonical (min, max) id order.
    6. Withdraw this item's claim on the pairs it no longer derives (never another writer's
       claim), then enforce the GLOBAL degree cap on this item and every neighbour touched.

    If the ANN index cannot serve a query it returns `None`, and this falls soft to the exact
    scan over every embedded chunk — the same contract retrieval honours. An unavailable
    index makes the pass slow, never broken, and never wrong: the exact scan is a superset of
    the candidates ANN would have returned.
