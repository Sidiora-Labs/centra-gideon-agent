"""Deterministic mention linking for knowledge ingestion (MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §1.3).

The entities stage of the ingestion pipeline is **LLM-only**: `EntityExtractor` asks a model
what the item is about, and everything downstream — mentions, relations, graph edges — depends
on that call. Which means:

* **With no model bound, nothing links at all.** A user running local-only, or between
  providers, ingests a document that plainly names an entity the graph already knows and gets
  zero mentions. The graph looks empty because the extractor never ran, not because the
  document said nothing.
* **A model can miss what a string match cannot.** Extraction is generative: an entity named
  once in passing, or written as a declared alias rather than its canonical name, is exactly
  the case a model drops and a trie hits every time.

So this pre-pass runs **before** extraction and independently of it: it walks the item's text
with the same `AliasIndex` the memory store uses, and records a mention for every known entity
whose name or alias literally appears. Zero LLM calls, zero tokens, no network.

**It ADDS, never replaces.** Extraction still runs and still creates new entities — the
pre-pass can only link to entities that already exist, so it cannot discover anything. The
two are complementary: the model finds what is new, the trie guarantees what is already known
is never missed. `add_mention` is `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so an entity both stages find is one
mention, not two.

**Why the same matcher as the memory store.** Reusing `AliasIndex` means the knowledge graph
and the push reflex agree about what counts as a mention. Two matchers would drift, and the
symptom would be a document that links in one surface and not the other — with nothing to
point at.
