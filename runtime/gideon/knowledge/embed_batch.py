"""Batched embedding with bounded retry and adaptive bisection (KL-15).

**What this replaces.** `pipeline/runner.embed_item_chunks` embedded one chunk per provider
call inside a bare `except Exception: vec = None` — no retry, no log, and no way to tell a
transient 429 from a permanently unembeddable chunk. `chunk_backfill.py`'s own comment stated
the consequence outright — *"chunks are embedded one at a time anyway — a bigger batch buys no
throughput"* — which is why its `BATCH_SIZE` was small; that comment is corrected in this same
change, since the round trips now amortize inside each item. Meanwhile
`EmbeddingProvider.embed_batch` has existed on the ABC the whole time
and, measured, had **zero callers in core** — implemented by the shipped `bedrock-models` and
`sentence-transformers` apps and unreached from the code that would benefit.

**Why bisection rather than a configured ceiling.** Providers are removable app bundles, so
core cannot know their batch limits: a ceiling is per-provider, per-model, sometimes per-token
rather than per-item, and it changes when the app updates. A configured maximum would be a
number core invents and gets wrong in both directions — too low wastes the batching, too high
fails whole imports. So a batch that fails in a batch-shaped way SPLITS IN HALF and each half
retries, recursively, until it succeeds or a single text fails on its own. The provider's real
ceiling is then discovered per run instead of declared, and the cost of discovering it is
logarithmic rather than the whole import.

**The invariant that makes this safe to put on an import path.** The returned list is always
exactly as long as `texts` and positionally aligned with it. A text that could not be embedded
comes back `None` — which the caller already knows how to store (a chunk with no vector stays
keyword-searchable). Nothing is ever dropped, reordered, or silently truncated, because a
short list would land as "these chunks belong to different text" and no test downstream would
notice.
