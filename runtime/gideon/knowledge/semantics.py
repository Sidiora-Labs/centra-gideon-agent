"""Knowledge-store semantics — typed kinds, logical identity, and idempotent writes.

The store already holds items. What it does not have is a way to say **"this is the same
thing I persisted last time"**. Without that, a retried persist node writes a second copy,
a rewound one writes a third, and a synthesis loop that runs nightly accumulates a hundred
near-identical articles that all look like independent corroboration.

So identity here is *derived*, not assigned:

**A logical key is `{kind}:{normalized_title}`.** Items keep their UUID primary keys —
changing that would rewrite every foreign key in the database — and the logical key is an
indexed derived column beside them. Lookup-before-write against it is what makes a persist
idempotent, and deriving it from content means a retry computes the same key without
having to remember what it did last time.

**A content hash decides no-op versus update.** Same logical key AND same content is a
no-op returning the existing id: the caller gets the same answer it would have got, and
nothing is written. Same key, different content is an update. That pair is the whole
idempotency story, and it works across retries, resumes and rewinds without any of them
knowing about each other.

**Duplicate content REINFORCES rather than inserting.** Re-persisting a known claim
appends a *mention* — source, confidence, quote — and re-aggregates confidence as
`1 - ∏(1 - cᵢ)`. That formula matters: three independent sources at 0.6 give 0.936, not
1.8 and not 0.6. Summing would exceed certainty; averaging would make corroboration
*weaken* a strong claim. `support_count` then becomes a retrieval signal, so a claim three
sources agree on outranks one nobody has confirmed.

**Supersession sets `invalid_at`; it never deletes.** "What was true when" stays queryable,
which is the difference between a knowledge base and a cache.
