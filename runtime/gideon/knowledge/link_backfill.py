"""Resumable batched entity-link backfill — the third job KL-14 clause 7 named (the
"graph linker backfill") and could not register, because no such callable existed.

`maintenance_passes.py` recorded the gap with its evidence: the only linker code was
`action_providers/knowledge_maintain_provider._reindex` / `_wikilink_mentions`, both private
helpers inside an action provider and neither a resumable library sweep. This module is that
callable, built the way the host's `batched=True` contract wants: one bounded batch per call,
returning how many items it claimed, so `_claim_batches` can drive it to 0.

**What it closes.** `link_known_entities` (the deterministic, zero-LLM alias linker) runs on
the ingest path — but only for items ingested SINCE it existed, and only against the entities
that existed at that moment. Everything ingested before it, and every item whose graph
neighbours were extracted from a LATER document, has no `mentions` rows it should have. The
entity graph, `/entities`, orphan pruning and every "what else mentions this" surface read
that table, so on a library with history they are all quietly thin.

**Resume state is the rows, not a cursor.** The backlog is a query
(`store.count_items_missing_mention_sweep` / `store.items_missing_mention_sweep`), so an item
leaves it the instant its sweep row commits. A killed run resumes by asking again — nothing to
persist, nothing to reconcile, and no crash window in which a stranded cursor could disagree
with the data. Same idiom as `chunk_backfill`, `count_items_missing_embedding`'s boot
auto-resume, and the ingest queue's `recover_pending`.

🔴 **Why the backlog is NOT "items with no `mentions` rows".** That is the obvious reading and
it does not terminate. An item may legitimately name no known entity, so it never gains a
mention, never leaves the backlog, and gets re-linked forever; because the host re-invokes a
batched pass until it returns 0, the head of the backlog would absorb every sub-batch of every
tick and the tail would never be reached at all. `mentions` records what was FOUND;
`mention_sweeps` records that the linker LOOKED. The backlog needs the second fact, so the
sweep row is written whether or not anything matched.

**Known limitation, stated rather than hidden.** A sweep is once-per-item, so entities created
AFTER an item was swept do not pull it back into the backlog. The correct fix is an
ENTITY-keyed incremental pass (given one new entity, find the items naming it), which is a
different shape of work — the alternative, invalidating every sweep whenever any entity is
created, would re-sweep the whole library on every ingest, and since `link_known_entities`
rebuilds the alias index on every call that is O(items x entities) index builds per tick. This
pass closes the standing historical gap; the incremental arm is its own atom.

    🔴 Measured: `KnowledgeStore.__init__` PRUNES every entity with no mentions and no
    relations on every open (`store.py`, "Prune orphan entities"). So a brand-new entity that
    nothing has mentioned yet cannot survive until this pass runs — it is deleted by the very
    open that would have linked it. That is the store's standing behaviour for every reader
    (the knowledge action provider opens the same way), not something this pass introduces,
    and it does not affect the case that matters: an entity extracted from document B already
    carries B's mention, so it survives, and linking it to document A is the whole job.

    mentioned once in a body is exactly the edge this backfill exists to record. It is also a
