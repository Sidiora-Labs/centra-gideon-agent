"""Scheduled research reports — the DEFINITION and its dueness (WF2KNO-12).

A research report is a standing question ("what changed in my sources about X?")
that fires on a schedule, searches a *source* scope, writes findings as
``research-finding`` knowledge nodes, and advances a watermark so the next run
only considers what arrived since. This module owns the persisted definition and
the single question a runner asks of it: *is this due right now?*

It deliberately owns nothing else. Scope resolution, the model loop, node
writing and delivery live in sibling modules; the runner is what calls
``is_due`` and ``record_run``.

Four scheduling failures this module exists to prevent — each is a test in
``tests/test_research_reports.py``:

1. **An unparseable expression fails CLOSED.** ``is_due`` never raises. A runner
   iterates *every* definition on every tick, so one malformed cron expression
   that escaped as an exception would wedge the whole sweep and silently stop
   every other report. A bad expression is therefore "not due, and here is why",
   with the offending expression named in the reason so the user can fix it.
2. **A never-run report anchors its first fire on its CREATION time.** The
   tempting spelling is ``last_run_ts or 0`` — which anchors a brand-new report
   on the Unix epoch, making every schedule already overdue by 56 years, so
   every report a user creates fires the instant it is saved. ``_anchor_ts``
   falls back to ``created_ts`` instead, and refuses to guess when even that is
   unset (fail closed rather than fire at 1970).
3. **A missed window fires ONCE, not once per window skipped.** Dueness compares
   the anchor against the *most recent* boundary at or before now, never against
   a count of elapsed boundaries. Catch-up-per-window is the wrong reading of a
   schedule: a laptop asleep overnight would wake to fifty queued model calls
   for a report the user only ever wanted the latest answer from. The user wants
   one report, not fifty. ``record_run`` stamps *now* — not the boundary it
   missed — for the same reason.
4. **A failed run records its error WITHOUT advancing the last-run timestamp**,
   so the next tick retries instead of skipping the window. The consequence is
   deliberate: a persistently failing report retries on every tick rather than
   on its own cadence, which is the honest trade (a visible ``last_status ==
   "error"`` plus retries beats a report that silently produces nothing until
   tomorrow). Runner-side backoff, if wanted, belongs to the runner.

And one watermark rule:

5. **The watermark belongs to scope-resolution time, not completion time.**
   ``record_run`` takes it as a parameter instead of stamping ``time.time()``
   itself. A run that resolves its scope at T and finishes at T+90s would, if it
   stamped its own completion, set the watermark past anything captured during
   those 90 seconds — and those items would never be considered by any future
   run. The RUNNER passes the timestamp it resolved the scope at.

The store is one JSON file under ``config_dir()``. A corrupt or absent file
loads as an empty list and never raises: these definitions are read on the
gateway's scheduler path and by the reports API, so an unreadable store must
degrade to "no reports" rather than take the gateway down. The file is
hand-editable by design, which is the other half of why rule 1 lives in
``is_due`` and not only in ``save_report``.
