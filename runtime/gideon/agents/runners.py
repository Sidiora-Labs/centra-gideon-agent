"""The BYO runner data catalog — definitions, measured health evidence, adapter verification.

EXECUTION-ISOLATION §3.1/§3.2 (EI-5). A *runner* is an external agent CLI the ACP
layer can drive (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kiro, or one a user brings). Runner
*registration* is unchanged — an app bundle still publishes an ``acp:<cli>``
:class:`~gideon.llm.registry.ProviderEntry` through
:mod:`gideon.acp_bundles._register`. What this module adds is the **catalog**:
the data a runner is described BY, and the evidence a runner is trusted ON.

Three parts, deliberately separate:

1. **Definitions** — declarative rows (:class:`RunnerDefinition`): which binary names
   to look for, which env var overrides resolution, which npm adapter package (if any)
   carries the ACP shim, which dialect the transport speaks. The shipped rows live in
   the sibling ``runner_catalog.json`` **data** file, not in code, and a user drops
   their own into ``$GIDEON_HOME/runners/<id>.json`` (same schema; same id
   replaces a shipped row). This module carries no vendor branching — every vendor
   value is a field read from data, which is what keeps the catalog a *catalog* and
   not a second registration path.

2. **Health evidence** (:class:`HealthEvidence`) — persisted per runner in the
   ``agent-metadata/<id>.runner.json`` sidecar. Every field is MEASURED or ``None``:
   ``latency_ms`` is a real elapsed measurement of a real probe, ``version`` is parsed
   out of the CLI's own output, and ``error`` is the probe's OWN text, verbatim. A
   value that was not measured stays ``None`` so the surface can say "unknown" — a
   fabricated ``0`` reads as an answer and is worse than an absent one.

3. **Adapter verification** (:func:`verify_adapter`) — provenance for the npm ACP
   adapter a runner launches through. Verified means: the adapter resolves to a real
   on-disk binary AND the Gideon-managed install prefix has a recorded
   provenance entry whose integrity still matches what npm reports on disk. The
   ``npx -y`` last resort can neither be pinned nor checksummed, so it is never
   verified. :func:`guard_unattended_spawn` is the enforcement point: with
   ``agents.unattended_requires_verified_adapter`` on, an unattended spawn against
   anything but a verified adapter is refused (fail closed — an uncataloged runner is
   unverifiable, so it is refused too). "Unattended" is not a caller's self-report:
   :mod:`gideon.session` derives it from the session key through
   :func:`gideon.guardrails.policy.is_unattended_session`, the same vocabulary the
   guardrail layer resolves safety profiles with, so cron fires, loop-cycle workers, the
   background/heartbeat key, inbox/side sweeps, channel deliveries and sessionless
   trigger dispatches are all covered without each one opting in.

Probe posture: the health probe runs ``<bin> --version`` (or the row's
``version_args``) and nothing else. It never opens a session, never passes a prompt,
and writes nothing outside the sidecar — so probing the catalog cannot touch a
workspace.

Shipped-data honesty note: ``gemini-cli``'s ``acp_args`` (``--experimental-acp``) and
``kiro``'s bin names are declared from the vendors' documented flags, not measured
here; the health probe below only proves the binary's ``--version`` behaviour. The
adapter ``version``/``integrity`` pins ship EMPTY on purpose — inventing digests we
have not verified would make :func:`verify_adapter` lie. Provenance is instead
recorded at provision time (trust-on-provision) and re-checked on every read, which
catches an adapter that changed underneath an install.
