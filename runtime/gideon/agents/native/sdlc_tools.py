"""Chat-callable tools to create + launch a Code project or Goal Loop.

The chat agent collaborates with the user on the plan IN the conversation, then —
on the user's explicit go-ahead — materializes the executable entity and starts it.
The flow is deliberately two-step (the user asked for "create the final executable
version ... and start it on user's direction"):

  • ``code_project_create`` / ``goal_loop_create`` — materialize a DRAFT (status
    READY: validated, persisted, NOT running). Returns the id + a deep link.
  • ``code_project_start`` / ``goal_loop_start`` — launch a created draft (or resume),
    only when the user says go.
  • ``sdlc_status`` — read the live progress of a project/loop (the data the chat
    progress widget renders: status, stage/phase, tasks, recent activity).

Code projects and Goal Loops are both kinds of the ONE unified Loop (kind ``code`` /
``goal``) on the unified store/manager/validation — these tools build a create body
and reuse the same mapper (`_build_loop_from_body`) + launch path the HTTP API uses,
so a chat-created entity can't bypass any gate a UI-created one gets.

State access mirrors the inbox sink: these run outside an HTTP request, so they reach
the process-wide dashboard state via ``native_source.get_dashboard_state()`` and the
autonudge service via ``autonudge.get_instance()`` — the same primitives the HTTP
handlers use (``request.app['state']`` + the service singleton).

This module holds ONLY the tool logic; the ToolDefinitions + dispatch live in
``builtin_tools`` so the agent loop discovers them with the rest of the builtin set.
