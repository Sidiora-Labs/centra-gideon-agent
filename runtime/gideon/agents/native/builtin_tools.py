"""Built-in file/code/shell tools for the native runtime.

In the ACP architecture the file/edit/shell tools were the external CLI's own
built-ins (claude-code provides Read/Write/Bash); ``gideon-core`` only
layered orchestration (spawn/memory/artifact) on top. The native in-process
runtime has no such CLI, so this provider supplies the essential workspace
tools — read, write, edit, ls, glob, grep, and bash — scoped to the session's
``cwd`` and gated by the same :mod:`gideon.security` checks (deny-list,
sensitive-path) plus :func:`gideon.sandbox.wrap_argv` for shell.

All paths are resolved relative to ``cwd`` and confined to it (no escaping the
workspace via ``..`` or absolute paths outside it). Tool execution itself is
also gated by the runtime's approval gate (``requires_approval`` per tool).
