"""Reader/writer resource reservations + the wave partition for one turn's tool calls (HC-6).

A model turn routinely asks for several independent lookups at once — read three files,
grep for two symbols, list a directory. The native loop ran them strictly one at a time,
so the turn cost the SUM of every lookup even though no two of them touched the same
thing. This module decides which of a turn's requested calls may overlap.

**The unit of the decision is a reservation, not a tool name.** Each call declares the
resources it touches as ``(mode, kind, key)`` triples — ``READ`` or ``WRITE`` over a
concrete path, a directory subtree, a glob PATTERN, or a non-path namespace. Two calls may
overlap iff no reservation of one conflicts with a reservation of the other, under the
reader/writer rule: two reads never conflict (same path or different), a write conflicts
with every reader and writer of anything it can overlap.

Three properties are load-bearing, in the order they matter:

1. **Unclassified means EVERYTHING.** A tool this module does not know is assumed to touch
   every resource there is, so it conflicts with every other call and lands alone in its
   own wave. An unknown tool therefore degrades to exactly the old serial behaviour rather
   than racing. That is why :data:`_RESERVATIONS` is an explicit allowlist and there is no
   heuristic fallback — a tool added elsewhere in the codebase is serial until someone
   states, here, what it touches.

2. **A PATTERN is never normalized.** This is our own recorded landmine, and it is the
   reason a pattern gets its own kind instead of being folded into a path key. Normalizing
   a glob turns it into a path-shaped STRING, and a path-shaped string is then compared by
   EQUALITY — so ``glob("**/*.py")`` would stop conflicting with a write to
   ``pkg/mod.py``: the reservation silently covers one nonexistent file named ``**/*.py``
   instead of every Python file in the tree, and the write overlaps a read it had to
   serialize against. Worse, ``abspath`` (which is what "normalize a path" means here)
   runs ``normpath``, and ``normpath`` treats ``*``/``**`` as ordinary segments and
   collapses an adjacent ``..`` against them — ``a/**/../b`` becomes ``a/b``, dropping the
   ``**`` entirely. So a pattern reservation keeps the pattern VERBATIM and conflict
   detection runs it through :func:`gideon.guardrails.registries.path_glob`, the
   matcher that already encodes this rule (PHF): normalize only the QUERIED ITEM, never
   the pattern. The one pattern shape that cannot be reasoned about as a pattern — a
   ``..`` segment, PHF's collapse case — is refused into ``EVERYTHING`` rather than
   normalized, so the unreasonable case serializes instead of guessing.

3. **Cannot prove disjoint ⇒ serialize.** Every uncertain comparison in
   :func:`_overlaps` answers "yes, these may overlap". Fail safe, not fast.

What this module deliberately does NOT decide: whether a call is *allowed* to run. A
reservation is about ORDERING and concurrency. Admission — the deny-list, the task-mode
gate, PreToolUse hooks, the approval gate, any pre-write read gate — stays where it is and
fires per call exactly as it does serially. The two compose: admission decides whether a
call runs at all, a reservation decides whether it may run beside its sibling.

# ``key=value`` fields:
#
#   tool batch mode=concurrent calls=8 waves=2 widest=6 ms=812

# * ``mode`` first, because it decides whether the row is a concurrency sample at all:
#   ``serial`` when the partition produced no wave wider than one (every call conflicted,
#   or the runtime's bound is 1 — the BASELINE arm), ``concurrent`` otherwise.
# * ``calls`` and ``waves`` together are the compression the partition achieved; ``widest``
#   says how much of it landed in one wave, which is what the wall-clock follows.
# * ``ms`` is an integer of milliseconds, matching the worktree line — these get compared
#   by eye and by grep, and a float prints ``1e-05`` on a trivial batch.
