"""The native in-process agent loop — ``NativeAgentRuntime`` (E2-P4).

A ReAct-style tool-use loop that runs entirely inside the Gideon process:

    user turn → INFERENCE (ModelProvider.complete) → if tool calls: execute
    (approval-gated) → feed results back → repeat; stop when a model turn makes
    no tool calls (or max_turns / cancel).

It emits the neutral :class:`~gideon.llm.events.AgentEvent` stream the chat
runner already consumes from ACP (text/thinking chunks, tool-call + tool-result
cards, a terminal ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` carrying *aggregated* usage), so the runner
needs no per-backend branching. History is owned **here** (``self._messages``) —
``ModelProvider.complete`` is stateless (E2-P2).

Decoupling: this module depends only on the ``ModelProvider`` /
``ToolProvider`` / ``AgentEvent`` contracts plus low-level ``security``. Hook
firing is an injected callable so the package stays free of any
``dashboard``/``chat_runner`` import.
