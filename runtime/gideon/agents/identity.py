"""Agent identity resolution — the canonical form of "which agent is this turn?".

One function, deliberately: normalizing a turn's agent identity is needed by anything
that records, scopes, or filters by agent, and it is not workflow-specific. It lived in
``workflows/composition.py`` because the old workflow feature's ``scope_ref`` was its
first consumer; ``chat_runner`` then imported it across that boundary. Relocated here so
the identity rule outlives whichever feature happens to need it (WORKFLOWS-V2 Phase 0).
