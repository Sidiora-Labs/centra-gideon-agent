"""Runner lifecycle — idle-release, lease records, transparent reconnect (§3.1(5)).

The ACP connection pool already does claim-and-rewarm: a warmed connection is handed to a
session and a replacement is warmed behind it. What it did NOT do is say *who is holding
what*, or notice that a holder went quiet. Both gaps are the same gap — nothing outlived the
pool's in-memory slot, so a gateway restart erased every fact about who had which runner, and
a session that stopped using its runner held it as far as any observer could tell (forever,
silently).

This module adds the durable half, and deliberately does NOT invent a second locking scheme
for it. It is an APPLICATION of the WORK-R8 claim convention in
:mod:`gideon.workflows.leases`: a flock (mutual exclusion for the read-modify-write) over
a JSON file under ``~/.gideon/locks/leases/`` whose recorded ``expires_at`` is the lease.
Same record shape, same directory, same expiry-at-render rule. Two lease systems that drift is
a documented risk of this plan (§12); one convention with two target namespaces is not.

The target namespace is ``runner:<runtime_id>`` — disjoint from the run/task ids WORK-R8 uses,
so neither can shadow the other.

**What the lease is and is not.** It is not the pool's mutual exclusion: the pool's own slot
already guarantees one claimant, because ``claim`` detaches the provider and the next caller
finds nothing. The lease is the *observable* half — the record a co-tenant session and the
Settings surface read to answer "who has the Claude Code runner, and since when". So a lease
that cannot be acquired is logged and stepped over rather than failing the claim: refusing a
claim on a stale advisory record would turn a visibility feature into an outage.

**Idle-release.** ``expires_at`` IS the idle deadline. Activity renews it (a same-holder
re-claim renews by construction — see ``containers.claim``), so a lease still in the future
means the holder was recently active, and one in the past means the holder went quiet for
longer than ``agent.runner_idle_release_secs``. Two things then act on that:

* every READER drops it (``lease_for`` returns ``None`` past expiry), so no surface can ever
  present a dead holder as the current one — this is the same
  drop-at-render rule ``board_row`` uses, for the same reason;
* :func:`sweep_idle_leases` deletes the file, so the release is a real state change and not
  just a rendering convention. The pool's health loop calls it.

Both halves exist on purpose: the reader's drop makes the surface truthful even if the sweep
never runs, and the sweep makes the on-disk state match what the surface says.
