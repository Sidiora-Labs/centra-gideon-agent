"""One propagated stop signal for a turn (PR2-12).

A stop is not a flag each layer checks when convenient. It is a single signal, held in
one place, that every layer of a turn reads — and that carries the obligations a stop
implies: an in-flight provider request is ABORTED rather than awaited-and-discarded, a
subprocess a tool started is terminated AND REAPED (so a stopped turn leaves no orphan
holding a lock or a file handle), and calls still queued behind the running one are
DROPPED without executing.

Why one object instead of a boolean per layer. Before this module the native runtime
carried ``self._cancelled``, each model provider carried its own in-flight future, the
bash tool carried nothing at all, and the subagent manager carried only a reaper
deadline. Four unrelated notions of "cancelled" meant a stop reached whichever of them
the caller happened to know about — which is why pressing stop killed the *stream* and
left the *work* running. :class:`CancelScope` is the single notion; the layers read it.

Reason, not just a bit. :data:`CANCEL_USER` (the user pressed stop) is deliberately
distinct from :data:`CANCEL_INTERNAL` (a circuit breaker tripped, a watchdog fired, the
host is shutting down). They produce different turn outcomes —
``STOP_REASON_STOPPED_BY_USER`` vs ``STOP_REASON_CANCELLED`` — because "you stopped
this" and "we gave up on this" are different facts about a turn, and a surface that
renders them identically is why users stop trusting the button.

Idempotence is in the primitive, not in each caller. :meth:`CancelScope.request` is
total: ``"no_turn"`` when no turn is in flight (a stop arriving after the turn already
finished is a NO-OP, never a failure), ``"first"`` for the call that flips the signal,
``"repeat"`` for every later one. Callers run the side effects — aborting the request,
reaping children — only on ``"first"``, so pressing stop twice cannot double-kill or
double-record.
