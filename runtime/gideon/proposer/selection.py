"""Target selection: a DIFFERENT cataloged runner than the one that stalled (§4.1).

The whole value of a second opinion is that it comes from somewhere else. So the exclusion is
structural, not advisory: :func:`select_target` removes the origin runner from the candidate set
before any other filter runs, and there is no argument, config value or tie-break that can put it
back. When the exclusion empties the set, the answer is ``None`` — the caller degrades to the
``subagent`` backend (a fresh Gideon brain, still not the one that stalled) rather than re-asking
the runner that already failed.

Filters, in order:

1. **exclusion** — the origin runner, matched on both catalog id and ``runtime_id`` so
   ``acp:gemini-cli`` and ``gemini-cli`` name the same exclusion.
2. **health evidence** — a runner with no recorded probe, a failing probe, or stale evidence is
   not a credible second opinion. ``None`` evidence means NOT MEASURED, never "fine".
3. **required capabilities** — persisted from the runner's own discovery handshake.
4. **binding order** — the user's preference breaks remaining ties; unlisted candidates follow
   in catalog order.
