"""The one-shot handoff brief (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §4.1).

agentsystem's ``/handoff-codex`` packet, generalised: everything a fresh brain needs to make one
useful attempt at a problem another brain got stuck on, and nothing it has to ask a follow-up
question to get.

Two properties the plan calls out explicitly:

* **The diff is FRESH.** It is taken at brief-build time, not carried from whenever the run
  started — "stale diffs are worse than none", because a proposer reasoning off a diff that has
  since moved produces edits that conflict with reality.
* **Transcript excerpts are FENCED.** Verbatim errors and tool output are exactly the untrusted
  text a prompt injection rides in on, so they go through
  :func:`gideon.security.fence_untrusted` before a second model reads them.

Redaction is applied ONCE per field, at construction, never again over the composed markdown:
``redact_credentials`` is not idempotent across a composed line, and re-screening a rendered
document destroys field names. Each source is screened at entry.
