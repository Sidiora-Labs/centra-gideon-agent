"""Fire-wait-verify orchestration for the second-opinion handoff (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §4.1).

One entry point, :func:`run_second_opinion`, doing exactly what §4.1 specifies and in this order:

1. **package** — build the brief with a FRESH diff and write it to a unique file under the
   run/loop dir;
2. **select** — a DIFFERENT cataloged runner than the one that stalled (§3 catalog, health
   evidence, capabilities, the user's binding order for ties), degrading to the ``subagent``
   backend when the exclusion leaves nothing eligible;
3. **fire** — one shot, headless, hard timeout, in the SAME sandbox class as the stalled run;
4. **verify** — re-diff disk; and
5. **decide** — accept only when the re-diff confirms the claimed edits.

Step 5 is the reason this module exists as a single function rather than a helper the consumers
compose themselves: three consumers (loop watchdog, gate node, the cockpit button) must not be
able to hold three different opinions about what "accepted" means. Every outcome — accepted or
not — writes a SEL row.
