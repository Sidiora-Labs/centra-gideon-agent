#
# `max_bytes` is raised DELIBERATELY, not removed: a whole-database shard copy is much larger

# from operator provider settings, never from anything an agent can influence.
#
# What that reachability does NOT get to include is the cloud metadata service, which is the one

# BROWSE-AUTOMATION §6.1: the headless-browser navigation posture. Every CDP
# ``Page.navigate`` is pre-flighted through ``guard.evaluate`` against this profile before
# the target URL reaches Chrome, and each redirect hop is re-evaluated (§6.2). A distinct
# profile — not CONNECTOR — because a browser is not ``net/client.fetch``: it renders, so it
# pulls dozens of subresources, follows chains the user never typed, and takes render time on
# top of network time. Public-only stance and ``on_violation="deny"`` are STRICT's, unchanged.
#
# ``allow_schemes`` is inherited and LOAD-BEARING here in a way it is not for a fetch surface:
# a browser understands `file:`, `data:`, `blob:`, `chrome:`, `devtools:` and `view-source:`,
# and a `Page.navigate` to `file:///etc/…` or to `devtools://` is local-file read / debugger
# self-attach, not egress. Keeping the tuple at ("http", "https") is what refuses those, so
# the pre-flight is also the scheme gate — do not widen it for a "convenience" local-file case.
#
# ``pin_resolved_ip=False`` — DELIBERATE, and the one field where True would be a LIE. Pinning
# means "the caller dials these exact validated IPs, so the name is never resolved twice"; it
# closes the rebind window only because ``net/client`` owns the socket. Chrome owns its own
# resolver and its own sockets: it re-resolves the hostname itself after our pre-flight, and
# CDP has no "connect to this IP" parameter to hand a pinned list to. So the rebind window
# between "we validated this host's A/AAAA records" and "Chrome resolved it again, possibly to
# a different answer" is REAL and this profile cannot close it. Declaring True would advertise
# a mitigation the surface does not implement, which is strictly worse than an honest False:
# a reader auditing the browse path would credit a control that isn't there. Note that
# ``evaluate`` still returns ``pinned_ips`` regardless of this flag — for BROWSE those are
# evidence for the SEL row ("at pre-flight, this host resolved to these addresses"), not an
# enforcement mechanism. Closing the window for real needs a browser-level control (a proxy
# Chrome must dial through, or ``--host-resolver-rules``), which is not this atom.
#
# Ceilings, each raised from STRICT for a stated reason and none removed:
#   * ``max_redirects=10`` (STRICT 5) — consent walls, geo/locale bounces and SSO hops routinely
#     exceed five on ordinary public sites, and every hop is re-evaluated by the guard (§6.2),
#     so an extra hop costs a check rather than a hole. Still bounded, so a redirect loop
#     terminates instead of spinning the browser forever.
#   * ``timeout_s=60.0`` (STRICT 30.0) — a navigation is render + N subresource round-trips, not
#     one request; 30s fails healthy slow sites. 60s bounds a hung navigation.
#   * ``max_bytes=50_000_000`` (STRICT 5 MB) — sized for what OUR code reads back over CDP (a
#     serialized DOM, extracted text, a screenshot), which a 5 MB page-fetch cap would truncate.
#     Honest limit of the field on this surface: it does NOT meter the bytes Chrome pulls for
#     subresources, because our code never sees that stream (see the gap note below).
#
# §6.3 — THE HEADLESS BYPASS GAP, recorded so nobody mistakes the pre-flight for a sandbox.
# A check in front of ``Page.navigate`` constrains exactly one thing: the top-level URL we ask
# the browser to open, plus its redirect hops. Once the page is live, Chrome egresses on its own
# for things we never evaluated:
#   * subresources the document requests (img/script/link/xhr/fetch/EventSource/WebSocket),
#   * cross-origin iframes and anything their scripts fetch,
#   * ``window.open`` / ``target=_blank`` and JS/meta-refresh navigations that never round-trip
#     through the CDP command we guard,
#   * service workers and shared/dedicated workers, which outlive the navigation,
#   * WebRTC/ICE and DNS prefetch, which are not HTTP at all.
# All of those resolve DNS and dial sockets inside Chrome, so neither this profile nor
# ``guard.evaluate`` sees them. The injected safety script (BA-2's other third) narrows the
# in-page, same-context JavaScript surface — it runs in the document, so that is the part it can
# reach. What remains OPEN after both halves land is the network-stack surface: subresource,
# worker and cross-origin-iframe egress, which no in-page script can intercept. Closing that
# needs enforcement at a layer Chrome must traverse — ``Fetch.enable``/``Network`` request
# interception, or a mandatory local proxy — and is deliberately NOT claimed by this atom.
