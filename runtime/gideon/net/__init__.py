"""Network egress/ingress security layer — the single outbound chokepoint.

One guard, one classifier, policy-per-surface. All outbound HTTP that could reach an
attacker-influenced host goes through :func:`gideon.net.client.fetch`, which
evaluates the URL against an :class:`~gideon.net.policy.EgressPolicy`, pins the
validated IP (closing the DNS-rebind TOCTOU window), re-checks every redirect hop, and
caps bytes/timeout. :func:`gideon.net.guard.classify_host` is the authoritative
"is this IP safe to reach" answer consulted by both outbound and inbound checks.
