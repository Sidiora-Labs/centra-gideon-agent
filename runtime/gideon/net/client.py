"""Egress enforcement plane — the ONE sanctioned outbound HTTP path.

``fetch(url, policy=...)`` is the single function tools/connectors/actions call. It:
  1. evaluates the URL (deny → uniform error + SEL audit, never silent),
  2. connects to the PINNED resolved IP so the name cannot rebind to a private IP
     between check and connect (closes the validate-then-reconnect TOCTOU window),
  3. re-evaluates EVERY redirect hop (a redirect to 169.254.169.254 is re-checked),
  4. enforces the byte cap (streamed) + timeout + scheme,
  5. emits a SEL audit event on allow + deny.

A blocked fetch raises :class:`EgressBlocked`, carrying the guard's reason +
recovery hints so callers surface it through the uniform tool-result contract rather
than as an opaque stall.
