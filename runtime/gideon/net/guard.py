"""Egress decision plane — the ONE authoritative host classifier + URL evaluator.

Pure and synchronous (DNS resolution aside) so it is trivially unit-testable with a
fake resolver. ``classify_host`` is the single source of truth for "is this IP safe to
reach" — both outbound (``net.client``) and inbound (``dashboard.origin``) consult it,
so there is one answer to "what is a private IP", not the divergent definitions that
existed across the webhook guard and origin checks.

``evaluate(url, policy)`` resolves the host, classifies *every* A/AAAA record, and
returns the validated IPs so the client connects to *those exact IPs* — closing the
DNS-rebind TOCTOU window a validate-then-reconnect guard leaves open.
