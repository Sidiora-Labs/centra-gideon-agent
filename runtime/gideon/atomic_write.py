# ── post-write notifier seam (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §5) ──────────────────────
#
# Every JSON store in Gideon funnels its writes through `_atomic_write`,
# which makes this the ONE callsite where "state just changed on disk" is
# knowable without teaching thirty stores to announce themselves. Time-travel's
# adaptive-debounce committer subscribes here; nothing else may assume it is the
# only subscriber.
#
# Two invariants a hook must never break:
#   * a failing hook MUST NOT fail the write — the write already succeeded when
#     the notifier runs, and losing the user's data because a history commit
#     hiccuped would invert the whole point of this subsystem;
#   * a hook that itself calls `atomic_write` MUST NOT recurse — the thread-local
#     guard below drops the nested notification instead of looping.
