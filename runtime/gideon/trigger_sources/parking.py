"""Parking the triggers bound to an app-contributed source (AUTO-A4, decision 9 semantics).

The plan's requirement: "enable/disable of the app registers/unregisters the source, and triggers
bound to a vanished source park with a typed reason, never silently die."

**Reuses `triggers/autopause.py` rather than inventing a second mechanism.** The decision comes
from `autopause.evaluate(exit_type=TRANSPORT_UNAVAILABLE)` — so the state, the health rollup, the
user-facing reason and the cooldown all come from the one table the rest of the substrate reads.
`transport_unavailable` is the right classification and not merely the closest: the source that
produced these events is a service this trigger calls, it is now unreachable, and the condition
resolves when the app comes back. A park is reversible and self-healing, which is exactly the
semantics of "the user disabled the app for an afternoon".

Deliberately NOT `disabled`: `enabled=False` is a USER decision, and `TriggerState`'s own docstring
names the failure — "showing both as 'paused' would make the user look for a switch they never
flipped". A user who disables a calendar app and later re-enables it must not have to hunt for
every trigger it fed and toggle each one back on.

**Which triggers bind to which app** is decided by :func:`bound_app` on the trigger's `event_glob`,
and the rule is narrow on purpose — see that function.

    A glob binds to app ``X`` only when its app segment is the LITERAL name ``X`` — i.e.
    ``app:calendar:*`` binds to ``calendar``, and ``app:calendar:meeting_soon`` does too.

    Narrow on purpose, and the exclusions are the interesting half:

    * An **empty** glob is the catch-all across every app's events. Parking it because ONE app was
      disabled would stop a trigger that still has live sources — a park that stops working
      automations is worse than no park at all.
    * A **wildcarded app segment** (``app:*:meeting_soon``) is the same case: it spans apps, so
      disabling one leaves it legitimately firing on the others.
    * A glob with **no ``app:`` prefix** is not an app-source glob at all.

    So the rule errs toward NOT parking, and that direction is chosen deliberately: failing to park
    a cross-app trigger leaves it firing correctly from its remaining sources, while over-parking
    would silently stop automations whose source is still present.
