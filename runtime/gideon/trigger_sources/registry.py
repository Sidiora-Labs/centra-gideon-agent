"""The flat trigger-source registry + the fenced ingestion path (AUTO-A4).

Mirrors :mod:`gideon.sync_transports.registry` and ``action_providers/registry.py``: the
``trigger_source`` provider-type handler (``providers/registry.py::TriggerSourceTypeHandler``)
registers an installed source here on enable and removes it on disable.

Unlike those registries this one also owns the **ingestion path** (:func:`emit`), because the
namespace and the fence are core's to apply, not the app's. An app hands over a
:class:`~gideon.trigger_sources.base.SourceEvent`; core derives the namespaced source
string from the REGISTERED name, fences the untrusted text with full provenance, and calls the
one bus emitter. Nothing an app passes can change which namespace it emits under.

    **The single ingestion point**, so the namespace, the fence and the provenance cannot be
    applied differently by two call sites — the failure mode that made the ``web_watch`` screen
    gap (S134) invisible for a release.

    Order, and why each step is where it is:

    1. **Refuse an unregistered source.** A source that is not registered is one whose app is
       disabled or uninstalled; accepting its events would let a stopped app keep firing
       automations, which is the opposite of what disable means.
    2. **Refuse an empty event name.** An unnamed event matches no glob a user can author, so it
       could only ever fire a catch-all — a silent widening of whatever that trigger meant.
    3. **Namespace from the REGISTERED name.** Never from the payload (see :func:`namespace`).
    4. **Fence the text AT ORIGIN**, with provenance naming the class (``app:<name>``), the
       instance (the event's key) and the transformation. The ``web_watch`` precedent (S127):
       fencing here means the downstream ``fence_payload`` leaves it alone (idempotent via
       ``security.is_fenced``) and the richer attributes survive, instead of a coarse re-wrap.
    5. **Hand to the ONE bus emitter.** `emit_event` is best-effort and never raises, so a broken
       trigger cannot break the app's own work.

    Never raises: a source calls this from its own watch loop, and an ingestion fault must not
    take down the app that observed the event.
