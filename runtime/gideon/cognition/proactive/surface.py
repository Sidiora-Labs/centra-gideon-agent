"""The read model the triage surfaces bind.

One function assembles the whole digest card, and the reason it is a pure function over
already-persisted data — the run row, the triage node's output, that run's ledger slice — is
that everything the card shows was recorded by the triage run as it happened. Nothing here
re-derives a verdict, re-runs a gate, or asks a model anything; the "strictly read-only on
view" is a property of this module, not a rule someone has to remember.

**Three failures this read model refuses to render as "nothing happened yet".** Each is a
separate, named state, because a card that draws an empty list for all three tells the user the
opposite of the truth in two of the three cases:

``uninstalled``  the "Morning triage" template pack was never installed. There is no schedule,
                 so nothing was ever going to run. The card's job here is to offer the
                 install, not to report an empty digest.
``off``          installed, but ``proactive.triage_enabled`` is false. The schedule is dormant
                 and it must READ as dormant-but-kept.
``never_run``    installed and enabled, but no digest has completed yet — the first one has not
                 come round. An empty digest and an unrun digest are different facts.
``ready``        a digest exists. Only now are the section lists meaningful.
``error``        the read itself failed. The caller passes the exception's text through and the
                 card says so. A swallowed read error is the single most confident way to say
                 "your machine did nothing", which is the opposite of what is known.

**An unmeasured count is never a zero.** Two absences are reported as absences rather than as
zeroes, because both are reachable in normal operation:

* ``auto_stage_ran`` is False when the digest ran with no auto-execution stage at all (the
  default: ``auto_execute_enabled`` is off). "Auto-execution is off" and "auto-execution ran and
  did nothing" are different sentences and the card must not print the second for the first.
* ``ledger_complete`` is False when the provider reported ``ledger_rows: 0`` while the summary
  says items WERE dropped or refused. The ``_record`` skips rows it cannot stamp with a run
  key, and reports the absence rather than faking them; a card that showed "0 filtered" there
  would be reporting the gap as a result.
