"""Stage 2 — the classifier gate (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.2).

The gate exists to spend nothing on a quiet window and to keep the per-source rules the user
wrote ("from GitHub notifications only surface review requests; skip dependabot") in front of
the expensive stage. It is a **filter with a real refusal path**: a `drop` disposition removes the
item from the digest entirely — it is not proposed on, and it is not listed. A gate that only
ever re-ordered its input would be decoration, so the drop path is the one this module is
written around, and `tests/test_proactive_triage.py` pins it against a floor taken from the
fixture rather than from the gate's own answer.

Two failure directions, deliberately opposite:

* **No rules, no items, or the gate switched off ⇒ no model call.** `should_call_gate` is the
  precondition guard; a window with nothing in it must not cost a token, which is the whole
  reason a cheap store query runs first.
* **A gate that ran and could not be understood ⇒ fail OPEN.** An unparseable disposition list, a
  disposition for an id the manifest never minted, an item the gate simply did not mention: all
  resolve to `propose`. This is the opposite of the proposal stage's fail-CLOSED (§1.3), and
  the asymmetry is the point — a broken *filter* that silently swallowed the user's inbox is
  worse than one that shows them too much, while a broken *proposer* that invented actions is
  worse than one that proposes nothing. PA-1 recorded the same split for `ProactiveConfig`:
  both switches fail closed, the classifier gate fails open.

The gate never sees an action, a tier or a rule id. It answers one question per item — is
this worth the user's attention — and the routing that follows lives in §1.4's matcher.
