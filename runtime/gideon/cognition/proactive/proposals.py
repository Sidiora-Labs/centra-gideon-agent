"""Stage 3 — tiered strict-JSON proposals.

ONE model call per digest emits an action-proposal array. This module owns everything that
happens to that array before anything downstream believes a word of it, and every rule here
exists because the alternative is a jailbroken inbox item deciding what the machine does:

* **Exact-ordinal contract.** `item_id` must render to an ordinal the manifest minted.
  Unknown ids are refused with `unknown_item_id` — never matched by prefix, never resolved to
  the "nearest" id, never fuzzy-matched against an item's text. A model that invented `"9"` for
  a seven-item window is guessing, and a repaired guess is an action against the wrong message.
  A JSON *number* `3` IS accepted, because the ordinals are decimal strings of 1-based
  positions, so `3` and `"3"` denote the same manifest line; refusing it would fail against a
  provider that emitted a number while buying no safety.
* **Tier is policy-clamped, not prompt-assigned.** The prompt asks for a tier; `clamp_tier`
  then RAISES it to the floor its action class carries. Anything that reaches outside the
  machine can never sit below `medium`; anything that permanently removes an item from the
  user's attention can never sit below `high`. The clamp only ever raises, so a model may
  volunteer more caution but never less — which is what makes "a jailbroken prompt cannot
  self-assign trivial" a property rather than a hope.
* **Fail CLOSED.** Unparseable output degrades to zero proposals and a `refused` reason. No
  retry loop against the schema: a second call with the same fenced content is the same
  content, so the retry buys a second chance at being injected and nothing else. (The
  opposite direction from the gate, which fails open — see `gate.py`.)
* **A cap that is enforced here, not requested in prose.** `MAX_PROPOSALS` truncates; the
  overflow is refused with `over_cap` rather than dropped, so the digest's counts reconcile.
* **Only what a Yes can carry out is offered.** Every proposal is a Yes button on the digest
  card, so a kind nothing performs is not in the action set at all, a kind its item cannot take
  is refused (:func:`cannot_act`: an Inbox operation on a run), and one item gets one proposal (a
  reply names the item, so a second proposal's Yes would answer the first).
* **A proposal binds only the arguments its kind declares** (:data:`ACTION_ARGUMENTS`), and its
  pattern only ever names its own kind. Its config cannot choose a provider, an operation, an
  item or a capability, and its pattern cannot ride a rule taught for another kind.

The schema is also emitted as JSON Schema (`proposal_schema`) with `additionalProperties:
false`, for the typed-structured-output path (`output_type`) on the
providers that enforce it natively. `parse_proposals` re-applies every constraint regardless,
because most providers do not, and a constraint that only holds on some backends is not one.
