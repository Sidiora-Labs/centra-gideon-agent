"""Stage 5 — rank + render.

Ranking is the substrate's materiality order and nothing else (`MATERIALITY_ORDER`):
runs that touched the world lead, errors follow, words follow those, noise sinks. Re-deriving
a second weighting here — "importance", "urgency" — would be a fifth dialect for the same
question the Run Ledger already answers, so this module consumes that vocabulary rather than
inventing beside it.

Rendering is deliberately deterministic and deliberately NOT a model call. A digest whose body
was written by a model is a second place injected content can reach a human, and the call
has already been paid; the body here is assembled from typed fields the pipeline holds. That
also makes the digest assertable: a test can require that a dropped item's title is absent,
which is the property the gate's refusal path only *means* something through.

The digest is `info`-ranked on purpose. `notification_allowed` defers `info` inside quiet
hours, which for a MORNING digest is the correct behaviour rather than a limitation.

    Sections, in order: what your machine did (the run lane, permalinks
    inline), what needs you (ranked proposals with their enforced tier), then everything else
    as a ranked list. A window the gate emptied renders the "nothing needs you" line rather
    than an empty body, because a blank digest reads as a broken digest.

    ``auto`` is the auto-execution stage's outcome, when it ran. What LANDED is the other half
    of the first section: what the machine did WITHOUT being asked, each line naming the rule
    that authorised it. It joins the run lane under one heading rather than getting its own,
    because "what your machine did" is one question and two headings would make the user read
    twice to answer it — and it is rendered FIRST inside that section, since an action already
    taken outranks a run that merely finished. What did NOT land is never under that heading: a
    failed or held action carries a "Not done: …" line on its proposal under "Needs you", and a
    stage that stopped as a whole (incident mode, the approval ceiling, the spend floor) says so
    once at the top of that section.

    **`proposals` must be the PENDING set, not the batch.** The caller auto-executes before
    rendering (`pipeline.run_triage`), so anything that ran is in ``auto.executed``; passing the
    whole batch here would list an item under "needs you" that the machine had already handled
    seconds earlier, which is the one thing a digest cannot get wrong. Nor is an item it handled
    "also waiting", for the same reason one section down.

    ``carry`` is what an earlier digest left waiting on you (`carry.place`): each carried proposal
    follows this window's own under "Needs you", under the number this digest gave it, saying it is
    carried over and how long it has waited (``now`` dates it), and the section says once how long
    a proposal comes back for. One dropped for its age is named in a section of its own, so it
    does not simply vanish. One dealt with meanwhile is not mentioned: there is nothing to ask.
