"""Stage 1 — the live collectors.

Three lanes, three functions, one rule each about what "accumulated" means:

* **inbox** — rows still wanting attention (`pending`/`seen`), muted threads and dismissed
  items already excluded by the store's own filters. Read from `InboxStore.items` rather than
  re-polling a source: the gate deliberately runs at DIGEST time over STORED items, because
  `evaluate_alert` fires once at ingestion and never re-evaluates. Re-polling here would be a
  second ingestion path with a second set of alert semantics. Only rows about no chat: the digest
  is no chat's work (`inbox_reach`), so a chat's own row reaches neither its model nor its run.
* **channel** — a `channel:` session whose last turn is not the assistant's. That is the
  cheapest honest reading of "unresolved": the machine has the ball. Sessions the user has
  since answered themselves fall out with no bookkeeping.
* **run** — the Run Ledger's own rows for recent runs that have ENDED (the substrate's
  materiality), NOT a fresh classification. A run that failed, was cancelled or was handed to you
  is `error`, one whose effect LANDED is `action`, one that only produced words is `response`. A
  run still going — the digest's own run among them — is not an outcome and is not collected,
  and a run is in the window it ENDED in, whenever it started: one that was still going when the
  last digest ran is in the next. A Morning triage run is the digest itself, never an item in one.
  The digest adds zero run instrumentation, so a materiality this module computed itself would be
  a second dialect for a question the ledger answers.

Each lane reads one item in one place (``_inbox_item``, ``_channel_item``, ``_run_item``), and
:func:`current_item` asks that same reading of one item whatever the window: whether a proposal
an earlier digest made still applies (`carry.recheck`) is the question the lane already answers.

Every collector is **defensive by construction**: a lane that cannot be read contributes zero
items and a warning, never an exception. A digest is a scheduled unattended run, so one broken
lane must not take the other two down — an empty channel lane is a smaller digest, an
exception is no digest at all, and the second failure is invisible until someone notices they
stopped arriving.

Nothing here numbers anything. Ordinals come from `build_manifest` over the union, because a
collector only sees its own lane and numbering is a property of the set (see `manifest.py`).
