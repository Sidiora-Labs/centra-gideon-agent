"""Stage 1 — the live collectors (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.1).

Three lanes, three functions, one rule each about what "accumulated" means:

* **inbox** — rows still wanting attention (`pending`/`seen`), muted threads and dismissed
  items already excluded by the store's own filters. Read from `InboxStore.items` rather than
  re-polling a source: §1.2's gate deliberately runs at DIGEST time over STORED items, because
  `evaluate_alert` fires once at ingestion and never re-evaluates. Re-polling here would be a
  second ingestion path with a second set of alert semantics.
* **channel** — a `channel:` session whose last turn is not the assistant's. That is the
  cheapest honest reading of "unresolved": the machine has the ball. Sessions the user has
  since answered themselves fall out with no bookkeeping.
* **run** — the Run Ledger's own rows for recent runs (AUTO-R2 materiality), NOT a fresh
  classification. A run that wrote something is `action`, one that failed is `error`, one that
  only produced words is `response`. This plan adds zero run instrumentation, so a materiality
  this module computed itself would be a second dialect for a question the ledger answers.

Every collector is **defensive by construction**: a lane that cannot be read contributes zero
items and a warning, never an exception. A digest is a scheduled unattended run, so one broken
lane must not take the other two down — an empty channel lane is a smaller digest, an
exception is no digest at all, and the second failure is invisible until someone notices they
stopped arriving.

Nothing here numbers anything. Ordinals come from `build_manifest` over the union, because a
collector only sees its own lane and numbering is a property of the set (see `manifest.py`).
