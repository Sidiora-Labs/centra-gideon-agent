"""What the next digest carries: the proposals you have not answered yet.

A digest numbers ONE window, and its card is answerable until the next digest replaces it. A
proposal nobody answered used to vanish with its card: the next digest collected only what was
newer than the last one, so what was still waiting on you was never offered again, and a quiet
morning replaced the card with an empty one.

The next digest now carries every proposal the previous one still had waiting:

* **What is carried** is what the previous card still showed waiting on you
  (:func:`waiting_from`, over `surface.build_digest_view`'s pending rows that carry no answer): its
  own proposals and the ones it had carried itself. One you answered is not carried, whatever the
  answer did, and neither is one the digest ran on its own.
* **Only while it still applies** (:func:`recheck`). Each is looked up as its lane reads it now
  (`collect.current_item`): an Inbox message archived, dismissed or answered elsewhere, a
  conversation that was answered, a run resumed or removed, has been dealt with, and its proposal
  drops out with no question. A lane that cannot be read here keeps it as it was recorded: not
  knowing is not "gone".
* **One proposal per item.** When the new window collected the item again (something new happened
  to it), the fresh look decides (:func:`place`): a fresh proposal replaces the carried one, an
  item your rules now filter takes it with it, and an item kept with no fresh proposal keeps the
  carried one under its new number.
* **For a week** (:data:`CARRY_DAYS`). A proposal is carried for up to that many days from the
  digest that first made it, counted in whole days so a schedule that fires a few seconds early
  still counts the seventh day. The digest that would carry it longer drops it and says so,
  naming it (:func:`dropped_note`), and every digest that carries one says how long it comes back
  for (:data:`CARRY_RULE`).

A carried proposal is never run on its own again: it was offered to you, and it waits for your
answer. It is not shown to the model either: the model is asked only about what is new.

Pure: nothing here reads a store or the clock. The provider reads the previous digest and the
live items; the pipeline places what is carried into the new digest.
