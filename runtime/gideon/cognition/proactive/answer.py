"""Your answer to the Morning triage digest, whichever door it comes through.

Two doors take an answer: the digest's card in Gideon (``POST /api/proactive/digest/reply``)
and a reply on the chat channel the digest reached (`proactive.channel_reply`). Both call
:func:`answer`, so a reply typed on a channel is the same answer a tap on the card is: the same
check of who is answering, the same reading of the current digest, the same grammar, the same run of
each proposal and the same record. Only what the door is (:class:`Door`) differs.

* **Only you answer** (`approval_answer`): a signed-in session of yours, or you on a paired chat
  channel. Asked before anything is read, and a refusal is audited there.
* **That digest, and no other.** An ordinal numbers ONE window, so an answer names the run it
  answers, and a run that is no longer the current digest is refused as expired rather than acted
  on best-effort against whatever is third today. A proposal you had not answered
  when the next digest ran is in that one (`proactive.carry`), under its number there, and is
  answered there like any of its own.
* **Attended.** A Yes runs its proposal through the digest's own stage
  (:func:`gideon.cognition.proactive.autoexec.auto_execute`) with ``answered=True`` and a synthetic
  approve rule standing for the answer — so the action denylist, ``enforce_action``'s SEL row and
  the budget floor apply to it as they apply to the digest acting on its own, and a second
  dispatch seam never exists. The two gates that are about work nobody answered do not:
  incident mode leaves attended work running, and the operator ceiling's ``ask`` is satisfied by a
  person answering, so the auto-execute grant is never asked for.
* **Idempotency is the run's own ledger, not a new store.** Every answered ordinal leaves a
  ``triage_reply`` row on the digest's run, so an answer that arrives twice — a double tap, a
  retried channel delivery, a reply typed after the gateway restarted — finds the first row and
  acks instead of acting again.
