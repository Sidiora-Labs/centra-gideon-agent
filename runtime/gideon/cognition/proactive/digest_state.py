"""The Morning triage digest as it stands: its schedule, its last run, and the card's view of both.

Read by every surface that shows or answers the digest — the card's routes
(`dashboard.handlers.proactive`) and a reply on the chat channel the digest reached
(`proactive.channel_reply`) — so an answer typed on a channel reads the same digest a tap on the
card reads. Below the HTTP surface on purpose: a channel's reply arrives through the guarded door,
which must not import a route handler to find out what the current digest is.

**Nothing here reports an unmeasured value as a zero.** No run is ``(None, None, [])``, which the
view turns into ``never_run``, never into an empty digest; see :mod:`gideon.cognition.proactive.surface`
for the state vocabulary that keeps "off", "never run", "empty" and "broken" apart.
