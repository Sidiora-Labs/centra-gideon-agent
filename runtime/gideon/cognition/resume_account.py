"""CE2-10: the account of what a resumed or compacted session ALREADY DID.

The observed defect: a resumed turn cheerfully repeats yesterday's completed step. It happens
because a resume hands the model surviving PROSE and asks it to infer what is already done —
``build_message`` skips thread history on a resume (the ACP/native agent owns it) and
``context_compaction`` folds the middle of the conversation into a summary. Both leave "step 3
finished" as something to be re-derived from narrative, and re-derivation fails.

So the account here is **DERIVED, never composed**. Every line traces to a record that some other
code wrote:

* the workflow ledger — ``step_completed`` / ``step_failed`` / ``step_skipped`` / ``effect`` /
  ``decision``, read through :func:`gideon.assurance.ledger.reader.read_events`. Written by
  ``workflows/controller.py`` (``journal.step_completed`` at :2961, ``journal.step_failed`` at
  :2334, ``journal.step_skipped`` at :1596, ``journal.effect`` at :2292, ``journal.decision`` at
  :3690).
* the session's tool history — the native loop's own message list, whose shapes
  ``context_compaction`` documents: an assistant message carrying ``tool_calls`` and a
  ``{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id", "content"}`` result.
* the turn checkpoints — ``turn_checkpoints.recorded_file_entries``, the pre-edit manifests
  written by ``agents/native/builtin_tools.py:1304``. This is the only source that PERSISTS which
  files a session's turns touched, so it is what a resume after a restart has to work from.

**No model call composes this text.** There is no ``summarize_fn`` here and no prose input. If a
fact is not in the ledger or the tool history, it does not appear in the account — which is what
makes it impossible for the account to invent a completion that did not happen.

**FAILED stays FAILED.** A step recorded as attempted-and-failed is carried as ``failed``, never
folded into ``done``, because a false completion is strictly worse than a forgotten one: a
forgotten completion costs one redundant step, a false one silently skips work the user asked for.
The same rule gives ``attempted`` its meaning — a tool call whose RESULT was never recorded (the
interrupted case) is the one the model most wants to call done, and it is exactly the one that must
not be.

Status vocabulary, and where each one's authority comes from:

============  ==================================================================================
``done``      ledger ``step_completed``; effect ``committed``; or a tool result that is neither
              an error nor a denial — the discriminator the runtime itself uses
              (``agents/native/runtime.py:1143``: ``failed = result_str.startswith("Error:")``).
``failed``    ledger ``step_failed``; effect ``compensated`` (it was rolled back, so it does not
              stand); or a tool result starting with ``Error:``.
``denied``    a tool result :func:`gideon.security.security.is_denial_observation` recognises. A
              denial is NOT a failure (WF2LEA-13) and is certainly not a completion.
``skipped``   ledger ``step_skipped``; effect ``skipped``.
``attempted`` a recorded tool call with NO recorded result, or effect ``attempted``/``retried``
              ("unknown, possibly fired"). The honest label for interrupted work.
============  ==================================================================================

**Stated as fact, not instruction.** The block says "the record shows X"; it never says "do Y".
A resumed model that read an instruction block would treat the account as a task list, which is the
re-run defect wearing a different hat.

**Bounded.** :data:`MAX_ACCOUNT_CHARS` is a hard post-render cap and
:data:`MAX_ACCOUNT_TOKENS` is its declared token ceiling, measured with the allocator's counter
(``context_headroom.count_tokens``) — this module adds no second token counter. Truncation is
announced in the block, because a silently shortened account is a forgotten completion that
nothing says was forgotten.

**A source that was never read is not an empty source.** :data:`NOT_CONSULTED` is a distinct
sentinel object, not ``None``/``0``/``""``: ``sources["ledger"] == 0`` means "read it, it recorded
nothing" and ``sources["ledger"] is NOT_CONSULTED`` means "nobody read it". The rendered block says
which. No integer can collide with the sentinel, and :func:`derive_account` gives its source
parameters NO defaults, so a caller that forgets one fails loudly instead of silently reporting
"nothing happened".

**Inconsistent record vs working tree ⇒ refuse.** "Inconsistent" is one concrete, cheap claim:
**a path the record says exists must exist.** Two feeders, both immune to a failed write:

* a write-shaped tool call whose recorded result was a SUCCESS (``files_written``) — the write
  landed, so the file is there;
* a turn-checkpoint entry with ``existed: True`` (``files_touched_existing``) — the file was
  present when this session was about to edit it, and an edit does not delete its target. This
  feeder is deliberately restricted to ``existed: True``: a capture with ``existed: False`` records
  a CREATE, and if that write then failed the file is legitimately absent, so checking it would
  refuse a resume over work that correctly did not happen.

A recorded DELETE is never presence-checked, and a path resolving outside the tree root is skipped
rather than counted. When the check finds a contradiction the resume raises
:class:`ResumeStateInconsistent` rather than proceeding on a false premise.
