"""Reviewer-comment triage — line-anchored findings, human acceptance, accepted-subset dispatch.

EXECUTION-ISOLATION §7 asks for Air's productized review loop "built once as a shared primitive
(not per-surface)": review-producing stages (workflow review/gate nodes, loop judges, the §4
second-opinion, inbox draft reviewers) emit line-anchored diff comments, a human accepts or rejects
each one, the accepted subset is dispatched back to the worker that produced the diff, and the
rejections feed calibration. This module is that primitive. It owns four steps and no surface:

1. **Parse** a review stage's output into canonical Finding records
   (`{severity, location, problem, why, recommended_fix, status}` — WORKFLOWS-V2 §Canonical-Finding,
   already the prompt contract in `workflows/bundled/shared/finding-record.md`) plus agentsystem's
   `auto_fixable` flag. One contract; this module adds no second schema.
2. **Anchor** each finding against the ACTUAL unified diff before anything renders it. This is the
   step the feature lives or dies on. A finding anchored to a line the diff does not contain is
   reported UNANCHORED with a typed reason — never silently re-pointed at a nearby line, and never
   shown as truth. Applying a real critique at the wrong line is the worst outcome available here:
   it corrupts working code while looking like review.
3. **Triage** — accept/reject per finding. An unanchored finding cannot be accepted: acceptance
   means "apply this at this line", and there is no line. Accepting it is REFUSED, loudly.
4. **Dispatch + calibrate** — the accepted subset becomes one follow-up brief delivered to the
   ORIGINATING worker; the rejections become `judge_divergence` calibration records (a reviewer
   whose findings are always rejected is a fake gate, and that is exactly what
   `workflows/judge_calibration.py` was built to detect).

**Propose, never write.** There is exactly one path from a finding to a delivered instruction —
:func:`dispatch_accepted` — and it reads `TriageResult.accepted`, which only :func:`triage` can
populate and only for a finding a human accepted. `auto_fixable` mechanical batching
(:func:`auto_apply_candidates`) filters the SAME accepted list rather than reading findings
directly, so "opt-in mechanical apply" cannot become a second door around consent. A rejected or
untriaged finding has no reachable route to a delivery call.
