"""Fire-wait-**verify**: the disk re-diff that decides whether a handoff is accepted (§4.1).

A proposer's final message describes what it *meant* to do. The plan is explicit that this is
not evidence ("the runner's final message describes intent, not what landed") and that
claimed-but-absent edits are a FAILED handoff, recorded honestly. So acceptance is decided here,
against bytes on disk, and nowhere else.

Mechanism: :func:`snapshot_workspace` records a content digest per interesting path *before* the
proposer fires; :func:`rediff` recomputes them *after* and reports which paths actually moved.
A claimed path that did not move is ``missing`` → :attr:`DiffVerification.verified` is False →
the service rejects.

Content digests, not ``git diff``, are the gate — three reasons: it works in a workspace that is
not a git repo, it sees a change git would ignore (``.gitignore``d build output the run cares
about), and it cannot be fooled by a proposer that stages or stashes. The git view is still
captured, because a human reading the brief wants ``git status``/``git diff`` prose; it is
decoration on the brief, never the acceptance test.
