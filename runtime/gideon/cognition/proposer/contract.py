"""The ``ProposerBackend`` contract — "ask an outside brain one question" (EXEC-ISOLATION §4.2).

The second-opinion handoff (§4.1) has two halves: *packaging* a stalled consumer's state into a
brief, and *invoking* something else with it. This module owns the second half as a four-member
contract so every future caller that wants an outside opinion reuses one seam instead of minting
its own subprocess dance:

* :attr:`ProposerBackend.name` — the stable backend id (``"runner:gemini-cli"`` / ``"subagent"``).
* :meth:`ProposerBackend.prepare` — render the brief into runner-specific instructions. Claude
  Code wants different framing than Gemini CLI; the *dialect* knows, so the caller does not.
* :meth:`ProposerBackend.invoke` — fire it one-shot, headless, inside the sandbox class the
  stalled consumer was running in. Returns a handle, does not wait for the answer.
* :meth:`ProposerBackend.collect` — wait, then normalise into ONE :class:`ProposerResult` record
  that loops / gates / the cockpit read identically.

**The load-bearing field is** :attr:`ProposerResult.diff_verified`. A runner's final message
describes *intent*, not what landed on disk, so the acceptance test is a re-diff of the
workspace (:mod:`gideon.cognition.proposer.verify`) — never the runner's own claim. A backend that
cannot prove the claimed edits are on disk MUST report ``diff_verified=False``; the service then
refuses the handoff (:mod:`gideon.cognition.proposer.service`). This is the plan's stated mitigation
for "second-opinion runner returns confident garbage" (§12).
