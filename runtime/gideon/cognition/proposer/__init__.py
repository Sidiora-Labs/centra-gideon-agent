"""Second-opinion handoff + the ``ProposerBackend`` seam (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §4, EI-7).

``proposer`` is "ask an outside brain one question, and only believe it if the disk agrees".

* :mod:`~gideon.cognition.proposer.contract` — the four-member :class:`ProposerBackend` protocol and
  the normalised result record every consumer reads.
* :mod:`~gideon.cognition.proposer.brief` — the one-shot handoff brief (fresh diff, fenced excerpts).
* :mod:`~gideon.cognition.proposer.selection` — pick a DIFFERENT cataloged runner than the one that
  stalled; the exclusion is structural.
* :mod:`~gideon.cognition.proposer.verify` — the disk re-diff that decides acceptance.
* :mod:`~gideon.cognition.proposer.backends` — the per-runner backend and the ``subagent`` fallback.
* :mod:`~gideon.cognition.proposer.service` — fire-wait-verify, SEL-audited, one definition of
  "accepted" for all three consumers.
