"""Structural retrieval — answer a question about STRUCTURE by traversal (KL-18).

``HybridRetriever`` answers "what is this query ABOUT". It cannot answer "what links to
this item": an inbound link is a fact the store already holds in a row, and an embedding
neighbourhood reproduces it only by coincidence — a document that cites a target while
sharing none of its vocabulary is invisible to every similarity arm, and a document that
merely rhymes with the target ranks first. So the two questions get two mechanisms:

* the similarity arm ranks by *proximity in meaning* (``retrieval.HybridRetriever``);
* this module answers by *traversal over stored relations* — ``item_relations``,
  ``item_citations``, the ``tags`` adjacency hierarchy, and ``items.updated_at``.

Three properties make the difference legible rather than nominal:

1. **Every hit carries its own path.** A structural answer is not a list of ids, it is a
   list of ``(item, path)`` pairs where the path is the exact chain of stored edges that
   reached it. A caller can render *why* an item was returned without a second query, and
   a wrong answer is falsifiable by inspection instead of a matter of taste.
2. **An empty result is a legible "no such relation", never a similarity fall-back.**
   ``StructuralAnswer.empty_reason`` names which structural fact was absent. A silent
   degrade to a semantic top-K is the specific defect this module exists to remove: it
   makes a structural answer indistinguishable from a guess.
3. **Structural and similarity retrieval COMPOSE, in one declared order.** Passing
   ``rank_query`` restricts FIRST (the traversal decides *which* items are eligible) and
   ranks SECOND (the semantic score decides their *order*) — :data:`RESTRICT_THEN_RANK`.
   The reverse order is not offered, because ranking first and filtering after silently
   drops eligible items that fell outside the semantic top-K, which makes the same query
   return different sets as the corpus grows. The order and the rank mode are both
   recorded on the answer, so a result is reproducible from what it reports.

Node references are namespaced (``item:``/``tag:``/``date:``) because a path legitimately
runs through more than one kind of node — a tag-subtree path descends tags and then steps
into an item — and an un-prefixed id could not say which.

**Known dependency, deliberately not fixed here:** ``item_relations`` carries no
``ON DELETE CASCADE`` on this branch, so a relation row can outlive the item it points at.
Traversal therefore treats an unresolvable neighbour as a dead end (dropped, never a hit)
rather than assuming the row set is clean. Once the cascade lands the drop becomes
unreachable; it is not load-bearing for correctness of a live store either way.
