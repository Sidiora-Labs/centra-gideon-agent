"""What became of each step of an item's ingestion: one record, read by every surface.

Every step the ingest reaches — a graph node or a terminal stage — ends with a
:class:`PhaseOutcome`: its ``status``, the ``reason`` in plain words, and the ``fix`` (what the
owner can do, each with where in the app to do it). The runner persists the map as
``file_metadata.node_phases``; the item page draws it, and the item-graph read adds whether a
skipped step could run now (``ready``).

Four statuses, kept apart because each asks something different of the reader:

* ``done`` — the step ran and did its work.
* ``failed`` — it ran and went wrong; ``reason`` is the error.
* ``skipped`` — it could not run for want of something the owner can add: a model, an engine.
  ``fix`` says what, and ``needs`` names the capability (a use case, or :data:`OCR_ENGINE`) so a
  later read can tell whether it is there now. A step that waited on a skipped or failed one is
  ``skipped`` too, and carries what that one was missing.
* ``not_applicable`` — the step does not apply to this item: a branch the graph did not take
  (a PDF with a text layer needs no OCR), or nothing to do (no intents are defined). No fix.

The sentences here are product copy, so each says only what is true of the run that wrote it.
