"""A report's schedule lives in the TriggerStore, so the existing clock fires it.

WF2KNO-12 shipped everything a scheduled research report needs except the thing that makes
it *scheduled*: the definition store, the runner, the API, the UI, the `research-finding`
kind and the delivery path were all live, and **nothing called ``research_reports.is_due``**,
so a due report never fired. Measured before writing: ``grep -rn 'is_due' src/`` returned no
caller of this module's ``is_due`` outside the module's own docstrings and its tests.

**Why a trigger row and not a sweeper.** ``gateway.py``'s ``_clock_loop`` is explicit that a
clock fire and a file fire go through ONE dispatch path "rather than two that drift". A
second loop iterating report definitions would be that second path: its own arming, its own
overlap policy, its own catch-up rule, its own audit trail — four decisions the trigger
substrate already made, re-made slightly differently. So a report's schedule becomes a
``clock`` trigger whose action is the provider that already exists:

    {"kind": "clock", "spec": {...}, "workflow": {"provider": "knowledge-report",
                                                  "config": {"report_id": <id>}}}

**Two schedules, one authority.** The trigger row decides *when the runner is invoked*; the
report's own ``is_due`` decides *whether this invocation counts as its window* — it owns the
four hardening rules (fail-closed parse, first-fire anchoring, fifty-skipped-windows-fire-
once, a failed run advancing neither stamp nor watermark), and those rules cannot be
re-derived from a cron expression. So the trigger is allowed to be *more eager* than the
report and the pre-flight absorbs the difference. Getting that backwards — trusting the
trigger and dropping ``is_due`` — would silently discard every rule the last session
falsified.

**The mapping is deliberately narrow.** Only what the clock spec needs
(``models.SPEC_KEYS["clock"]``: kind / expr / at / interval_secs / timezone), because a
trigger row carrying scope or citation policy would be a second copy of the definition, and
two copies of a schedule is the drift this module exists to avoid.

    🔴 The drift this closes, found by a test that expected a `timezone` key and got none.
    `ReportDefinition.tz` documents `""` as "resolved", and `_report_tz` honours that. But an
    ABSENT `spec["timezone"]` used to mean something different on the trigger side —
    `arm._trigger_tz` fell back to **UTC** — so a report with no explicit zone on a non-UTC
    host would have its trigger armed for the UTC hour while `is_due` waited for the local
    one: the fire would arrive and be skipped as not-due, and the report would run late or not
    that day. The pre-flight makes that safe rather than wrong, which is exactly why it would
    have gone unnoticed.

    🔴 AND IT DID NOT ACTUALLY COMPENSATE, measured (#2520). This function exists to paper
    over `arm`'s UTC default, and it resolved through `get_local_tz()[0]` — which itself
    answered `'UTC'` whenever `config.timezone` was blank, which is the stock install. So on
    the very hosts the workaround was written for, it wrote `"UTC"` into the spec and the
    report still ran at the wrong hour. That is the cost the issue names: a hand-rolled copy of
    a resolution nobody owned, which looked like a fix and was not one.

    Now `gideon.core.timezones.resolve_zone_name` — the SAME function `_report_tz` and
    `arm._trigger_tz` call, so the two sides cannot disagree about what "resolved" means. An
    unusable `defn.tz` still writes no key rather than raising: a schedule must stay writable
    while its zone is being corrected, and `arm.semantic_spec_issues` names the bad zone.
