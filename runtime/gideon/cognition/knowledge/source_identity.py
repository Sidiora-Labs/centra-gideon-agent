"""Item identity for watched sources (WATCHED-SOURCES §3.3).

Two different questions, deliberately answered by two different functions, because
answering them with one key is how a dedup system either duplicates everything or
collapses unrelated stories:

* :func:`compose_guid` — *"is this the same item THIS source already gave me?"* The
  per-source novelty key the seen-set and the ``UNIQUE(source_id, guid)`` index are
  built on. Scoped to one source, so it can be as loose as the source's own notion of
  identity (a feed guid, a row id, a path).
* :func:`merge_key` — *"is this the same STORY a DIFFERENT source already gave me?"*
  The cross-source key, and the only thing in the system that can collapse two
  sightings into one item with two attributions.

Both are deterministic string work — never a model (§3.3's "URL/id matching is code,
not model" rule), so the same feed always yields the same identity, dedup costs zero
tokens, and nothing about it depends on a provider being reachable.

**The merge rule is canonicalized-URL equality, and nothing else.** Not title, not
title+date, not fuzzy similarity. Two feeds carrying one story agree on the link they
point at; they do NOT agree on the headline (an aggregator rewrites it, a newsletter
prefixes it, a mirror translates it), and two genuinely different stories published the
same day share a date. A wrong merge is strictly worse than a duplicate: a duplicate is
visible and one delete away, while a wrong merge silently destroys one of two distinct
items and stamps the survivor with an attribution that is a lie. So when identity is
ambiguous this module returns ``""`` — no merge key — and the engine keeps both items.

Two guards make that concrete:

* **No URL, no merge.** An item with no link (an "Ask HN" post, a CSV row with only a
  title) has no cross-source identity available, so it is always its own item.
* **A bare origin is not a story.** ``https://example.com`` canonicalizes from a feed
  whose entries all point at a site's homepage; merging on it would collapse every item
  from that site into one. A merge key requires a path or a query.
