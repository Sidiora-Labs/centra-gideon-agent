"""Knowledge ↔ markdown projection: the library as plain files the owner owns (KL-20).

A knowledge item used to be reachable only through ``knowledge.db``. This module projects
every item to a human-readable markdown file under the owner's home, with YAML front-matter
carrying identity and relations, and reads an owner's edit **back** — which is the whole
difference between an export and ownership.

**It is the memory vault's projector, pointed at the knowledge store — not a second one.**
The atom says so explicitly, and the reason is the swallowed-write family's worst shape: two
projectors writing the owner's files, each treating the other's bytes as a hand edit,
overwriting each other forever with nothing in either's summary saying so. So every mechanic
MGAV-6 already ships is imported from :mod:`gideon.cognition.memory_vault` rather than
reimplemented:

* **mode config** — the same three-valued vocabulary (``MEMORY_VAULT_MODES``:
  ``off`` / ``mirror`` / ``two_way``), resolved the same way and failing to ``off`` for the
  same reason (:func:`vault_mode_from_config`);
* **the page format and its wikilink projection** — :func:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.slug`,
  :func:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.compose_page`,
  :func:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.split_page`,
  :func:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.parse_frontmatter`,
  :data:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.GENERATED_MARKER` and
  :func:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.extract_edited_value`, so an Obsidian vault of memory
  and one of knowledge are the same artifact in two directories;
* **the sync pass** — the same ``absorb → project → collect deletions`` order, for the
  reason MGAV-6 documents: re-render first and the owner's text is gone before it is read;
* **its verification** — the same ``(check, key, detail)`` flag shape, the same
  ``sync_conflict`` front-matter stamp and the same broken-link / orphan-page checks over
  :data:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.WIKILINK_RE`, so a refusal is visible in the file the
  owner was just editing as well as in a health surface.

**The content hash already excludes the field it writes.**
:func:`~gideon.cognition.memory_vault.body_hash` covers the BODY only and ``source_hash`` lives
in the front-matter, so writing the hash cannot change the value being hashed. That is not a
property this module adds — it is why MGAV-6's hash is body-only, and inheriting it is what
makes a projection unable to retrigger itself. ``test_projection_does_not_retrigger_itself``
is the proof rather than this paragraph.

What is genuinely NEW here, because memory did not need it:

**A ledger, not a manifest.** MGAV-6 keeps ``.vault-manifest.json`` and re-renders every
record on every sync — fine for a few hundred facts, wrong for a library. The projection
backlog is instead keyed in ``vault_projections`` (see the DDL): "which items disagree with
their ledger row". A keyed backlog returns rows only when there is real work and 0 exactly
when the vault is settled, which is the contract KL-14's sub-batch loop is written against.
A cursor-and-scan design would have examined one window per TICK, so an edit to the
ten-thousandth item would have waited hours behind items with nothing to say.

**Deletion is explicit in BOTH directions, and neither direction destroys.**
A file the owner removed is tombstoned (``owner_deleted``) and never re-created — "no row"
would mean "project it again", so the absence has to be recorded rather than inferred. It
does **not** delete the item: a missing file is an ambiguous signal (a moved directory, a
sync client, a bad backup restore) and deleting the owner's knowledge on it would be
unrecoverable. An item removed in the app has its file unlinked and its row forgotten, which
is why the ledger deliberately carries **no foreign key** — ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` would take
away the only record that a file existed.

**A two-sided change SURFACES.** The ledger stores both what the store said
(``projected_updated_at``) and what we wrote (``projected_body_hash``), so "the owner edited
the file", "the store moved" and "BOTH moved" are three distinguishable states rather than
one. The third writes nothing to the store, leaves the file byte-for-byte, stamps
``sync_conflict`` into its front-matter and stands the row up in
:meth:`KnowledgeVault.lint_flags` and the Doctor's ``knowledge-vault`` probe. With only one
of the two recorded, that state is indistinguishable from a plain edit and every projection
resolves silently toward the database.

**Gated off by default.** ``knowledge.vault_mode`` defaults to ``off`` and an unreadable
config resolves to ``off``: a control that writes the owner's files must be chosen. Its
proof is not that the flag exists but that flipping it makes files appear — see
``test_gate_off_writes_nothing`` next to ``test_gate_on_projects_files``.
