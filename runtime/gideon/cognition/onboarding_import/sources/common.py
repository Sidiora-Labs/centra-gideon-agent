"""What every source reader shares, so two tools' importers cannot drift on the parts that match.

- **Paths another machine recorded.** A tool's home copied from an old laptop names that laptop's
  home (``/Users/old-name/src/app``). :func:`on_this_machine` finds the same path under THIS home,
  and :func:`display_path` says it the way a person reads it.
- **One file, one item** (:func:`text_item`), read through floors 1 and 2.
- **Skills** (:func:`scan_skills`): a directory with a ``SKILL.md``, whichever tool it came from,
  with the supply-chain scan its install will make (:class:`ImportedSkillMarketplace`).
- **Prompt history** (:func:`prompt_history`): counted and named, never imported.
- **A document that does not parse** (:data:`UNPARSABLE`): read as unreadable, never a scan fault.
- **A conversation file, as the step lists it** (:class:`Transcript`, :data:`READINGS`): read in
  full, or — for the thousands of files a months-long history holds — only as far as its first
  prompt, and remembered until the file changes. Its title and note (:func:`one_line`,
  :func:`conversation_note`).
- **An MCP server** (:class:`McpServer`, :func:`mcp_item`): what a tool has configured, values
  included, for the onboarding scan and the Tools page's Import — one definition, one writer.
- **A command the tool refuses** (:func:`denied_command_item`), and the rest of its settings
  (:func:`settings_not_imported`), named and left where they are.
