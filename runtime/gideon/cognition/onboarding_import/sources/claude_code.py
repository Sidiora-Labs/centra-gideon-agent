"""Claude Code scanner — ``$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` (default ``~/.claude``) and the files beside it.

A pure function of what Claude Code writes: :func:`scan` opens files, applies the floors, and
returns a :class:`~..model.ScanResult`. It holds no store, no session and no config handle, so
it is fixture-testable against a throwaway root — and it never writes to anything it reads
(importing from another tool must not modify that tool).

What it maps — the layout Claude Code 2.x writes, and nothing it does not:

==============================================  =============================================
``CLAUDE.md``, ``rules/**/*.md``                ``instructions`` (yours, every project)
``<project>/CLAUDE.md``, ``.claude/CLAUDE.md``,  ``instructions`` (one per project Claude Code
``CLAUDE.local.md``                             has been used in)
``projects/<cwd>/memory/*.md``                  ``memories`` (``MEMORY.md`` is their index)
``.claude.json`` → ``mcpServers``               ``mcp_servers``, user scope
``.claude.json`` → ``projects[p].mcpServers``   ``mcp_servers``, local scope
``<project>/.mcp.json`` → ``mcpServers``        ``mcp_servers``, project scope
``skills/<name>/SKILL.md``                      ``skills``
``agents/**/*.md``                              ``agents``
``commands/**/*.md``                            ``prompts``
``projects/<cwd>/<session>.jsonl``              ``conversations``
``settings.json`` → ``permissions.deny``        ``denied_commands`` (each ``Bash(…)`` rule)
``settings.json`` → the rest, ``history.jsonl``  not imported — the scan counts each and says why
==============================================  =============================================

**Where the projects are.** Claude Code records every directory it has been used in as a key of
``.claude.json`` → ``projects``, and names each one's transcript and memory directory by that
path with every character that is not a letter or digit turned into ``-``. A ``~/.claude`` copied
from another machine still names that machine's paths (``/Users/old-name/src/app``), so a
recorded path that does not exist here is looked for under THIS home before it is given up
(:func:`~.common.on_this_machine`) — a project's own ``.mcp.json`` and ``CLAUDE.md`` live in the
project, not in ``~/.claude``.
