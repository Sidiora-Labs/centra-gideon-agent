"""Security floors every scanned byte passes — reusing ours, not new ones.

Reading another tool's config is reading a directory full of things the user never
meant to hand over: an OAuth token cache, a `.env`, an API key in an MCP server's
`env` block. Three floors apply, in this order, and all three are counting floors —
the user is told how much was withheld, never what it was:

1. :func:`refuses` — a credential-bearing PATH is never opened. ``is_sensitive_path``
   (the same predicate that blocks the agent's file reads) plus a filename denylist,
   because a fixture/foreign root outside ``$HOME`` doesn't match the home-relative
   rules.
2. :func:`strip_secrets` — a secret-NAMED key inside a config we DO read is dropped
   before the value is ever copied into an :class:`~.model.ImportItem`.
3. :func:`safe_text` — free text keeps its body but loses embedded credentials and
   exfiltration URLs (``redact_credentials`` / ``redact_exfiltration_urls``).

Nothing here returns a secret value. Every function returns a count, so a caller
*cannot* accidentally log one.

This module never writes: the foreign root is strictly read-only.
