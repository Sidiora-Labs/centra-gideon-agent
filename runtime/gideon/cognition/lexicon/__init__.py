"""Lexicon (core LEX) — the personal vocabulary + learned-corrections service.

Auto-built from the knowledge graph's entities, it (a) BIASES the STT decoder toward the
user's terms before transcription and (b) CORRECTS mis-heard terms after. Lives in core so
it improves every audio/video item + all voice input; surfaced + editable via the
Vocabulary UI (/api/lexicon/*).
