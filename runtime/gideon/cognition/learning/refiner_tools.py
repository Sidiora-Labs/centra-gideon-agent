"""The template refiner's propose-only tool set — WF2LEA-6 (§3.1 substrate/trust/shape).

The refiner ships as a trigger-fired ``run-workflow`` template
(``workflows/bundled/refine-template``) whose stage runs the reserved ``template-refiner``
agent. That agent holds ONLY the tools named
here, and every one of them is read-or-propose: it can read a template's own run-ledger evidence
and it can FILE a ``template_diff`` proposal — it cannot apply one, install a skill, or write a
template. "Propose-don't-write" is therefore structural, not a matter of prompt discipline: the
apply tools live only on the human-facing review surface (``learning/inbox.require_human`` + the
accept handler), never in this set.

The two tools consume exactly the S73/S79 decision functions:

* ``gather_evidence`` → ``refiner.cluster_safely`` (screens hostile ledger text, S79) +
  ``refiner.fenced_evidence`` (fences it at the model boundary, S79) + ``refiner.top_cluster``
  (the power-floor cluster worth proposing against, S73). The agent reasons over the RESULT.
* ``file_template_diff`` → ``refiner.check_diff`` (the frozen-region + legal-op gate, S73) before
  ``proposals.enqueue`` — an op touching ``id``/``triggers``/surfacing metadata is refused here, so
  a self-editing template can never change WHEN it fires.
