"""Self-updating project context, reviewed and gated (LEARN E1.4 — WF2LEA-12).

`project_context.py` owns what a project KNOWS — the living overview, the wayfinder ledgers,
the operating instructions the block injects. This module is the propose-half of the pattern
the plan names in §(c): you ask the assistant to review a conversation, it proposes updates to
the project's **instructions**, **files**, and **skills** with a reason per item, and *nothing
is written until you accept*.

**Propose, never write.** Like `self_model_observer`, this files typed PROPOSALS through the one
shared human-gated queue (`learning.proposals`) and installs nothing at review time. The three
`project_*` kinds map to the three real sinks a human accept then writes to:

* ``project_instruction`` → appended to the project's ``agent_instructions_template`` (the "how"
  the block renders as instructions);
* ``project_file`` → an inlined context file under the project's ``context/`` dir;
* ``project_skill`` → a new skill via the existing ``ProcedureLibrary.create_skill`` rail (no new
  store — the plan's E1.3 was explicit that a second skill path is out of scope).

**Deterministic, no model at review time.** The reviewing agent has the conversation in-context
and identifies the candidate changes; this module VALIDATES and ROUTES them — it does not run an
LLM to re-extract them. That keeps the review a pure function over typed candidates plus the
transcript it grounds each proposal in, and keeps this file off the degraded-LLM surface map.

**Decision memory is reused, not reinvented.** Every candidate goes through `proposals.enqueue`,
which already fingerprints the change, suppresses one a prior decision ACCEPTED or REJECTED, and
reinforces a pending duplicate. So a suggestion the user declined does not re-surface on a second
review — clause 4 of the contract is the queue's existing machinery, wired through, not rebuilt.
