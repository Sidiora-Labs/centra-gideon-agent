"""Watched-scratchpad intake — a jotted line becomes a PROPOSED plan (UP-R18 / crit 9).

The barrier to starting work here is "create a plan"; the barrier to writing something down in a
notes file is nothing. This closes that gap in the only direction that is safe: a periodic scan of
one configured local file turns each actionable line into a **proposal in the needs-input inbox**,
never into a run. Nothing on this path can start a workflow — a human accepts first.

**Why the checked/struck filter is the substance, not a detail.** A markdown scratchpad's `- [x]`
items are DONE and its `~~struck~~` lines are ABANDONED. Proposing either is the single most
visible way this feature could be wrong: it would hand the user back the work they already finished
or deliberately dropped, every scan, forever. So the filter is structural (it runs before anything
else) and it is tested per-form.

**Two dedup tiers, because one is not enough.** `emit_attention_item`'s `dedup_key` only matches
PENDING/SEEN rows (`inbox.py` ``_find_open_by_dedup``), which is exactly right for its own job — a
DISMISSED request is genuinely new when it recurs — and exactly wrong here: a user who dismisses
"plan the nursery renovation" is saying no, and a line they never edit would re-propose on the next
scan. So this module keeps its OWN persisted seen-set keyed by content hash, and the inbox key is
the second tier that catches a same-scan/same-process double emit. The seen-set is what makes a
restart quiet; the inbox key is what makes a re-entrant scan quiet.

**Content hash, not line number.** Inserting a line at the top of a notes file renumbers everything
below it. Keying the seen-set on the line's own normalized text means editing line 3 re-proposes
only line 3, and reordering the file proposes nothing. The line NUMBER still rides along as the
backlink, because that is what a human needs to go read the source.

**What plays the triage gate here.** `triage_line` is it: a structural verdict (checked, struck,
heading, fence, too short) plus the shipped pre-LLM injection screen (`triggers.screen.screen`) plus
an actionability test. A declined line is recorded in the seen-set with its reason, so a line that
is not work is asked about once and never re-tried — an un-recorded decline is a silent retry loop.
The intent classifier is `workflows.intent.classify`, the same deterministic no-LLM classifier the
chat planner routes on, so a scratchpad line and a typed intent classify identically.
