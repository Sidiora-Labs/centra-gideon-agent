"""Shared planner-pass runner — spawn a tool-equipped planner agent, arm a bounded
autonudge run with a brief, poll for a sentinel file, return its text, tear down.

Used by BOTH the Code feature and Goal Loop for every pass of the stepwise
walkthrough (design pass + each step pass). The runner is feature-agnostic: callers
pass the resolved primitives (session key, agent name, the agent's cwd, the dir
where the sentinel + STOP file live, the model/ACP binding). Feature modules wrap
this with their own project/loop lookup.

The autonudge loop self-halts the moment the sentinel appears (via the STOP file),
so the planner is a bounded one-author task, never a runaway loop.
