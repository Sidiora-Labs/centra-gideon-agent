"""Workflows tool category — author, run, steer and inspect composable workflows.

The chat surface over the v2 engine: 19 tools (WORKFLOWS-V2 §4). Every one delegates to
`workflows.service`, the single implementation the REST routes (Slice 7a) will also call —
two surfaces over one engine must not grow two behaviours.

Exposes `_list_tools` / `_call_tool` in the same shape as `mcp_prompts` / `mcp_memory`, so
the in-process `InProcessMcpToolProvider` and the aggregating `mcp-core` server consume it
through one path. Unlike the other categories this one does NOT go over HTTP: the engine is
in-process, and a chat tool that round-tripped through the gateway to reach an object in the
same process would add a failure mode (and a port dependency) for nothing.

Two deliberate shapes in the descriptions:

**`workflow_plan` and `workflow_author` are separate tools.** Plan takes a natural-language
goal; author takes a spec. Overloading one name with both contracts was flagged in design
review as a semantic clash — a model cannot tell which contract it is fulfilling.

**Errors come back as readable text with a stable code.** A tool that raises burns the turn
on a traceback the model cannot act on. `WF_DEF_INVALID` plus the issue list is something it
can actually fix and retry.
