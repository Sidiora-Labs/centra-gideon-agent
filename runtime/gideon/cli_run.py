"""Headless one-shot CLI turn — ``gideon run`` (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §9.5).

The CLI face of the inbound-access story the rest of that plan builds over HTTP: a
non-interactive caller runs ONE agent turn and consumes structured output. It is a
*client*, not a second engine — the turn runs inside the gateway through the same
``POST /api/chat`` + ``/api/ws`` pair the dashboard drives, so there is exactly one
turn path and one stream contract.

Why not extend ``gideon chat -m``: that command talks to a provider factory
directly (``cli_chat._chat``), which means no gateway, no session store, no safety
profile, no tool-approval gate and no spend attribution. It is a provider smoke test.
A scripted/CI caller needs the gated path, and §9.5 says so explicitly ("executes one
turn against the local gateway"). ``chat -m`` keeps its behaviour; ``run`` is the
gated sibling, and the two are told apart in ``docs/reference/cli.md``.

Safety posture (fail-CLOSED, and the reason this module exists at all):

* The session key is ``inbound:cli:<...>``, which ``guardrails.policy`` classifies as
  unattended, so the run resolves through the ``HEADLESS`` SafetyProfile by
  construction rather than by anything this module remembers to pass.
* Read-only default is enforced by the session's TASK MODE (``ask``), not by
  ``SafetyProfile.tool_grants``. That field has no enforcement point anywhere in the
  tree today (see ``guardrails/policy.py``'s module docstring: it lands "when that
  engine lands and consumes ``tool_grants``"), so trusting it would have shipped a
  read-only promise that denies nothing. ``task_mode_denies`` is deny-by-default,
  runs BEFORE the approval gate, and is documented as un-bypassable by Trust/YOLO —
  it is the only read-only posture in this codebase that actually holds.
* ``--allow`` is the explicit write grant (task mode ``agent``), printed to stderr at
  start so a script is self-documenting about the posture it asked for.
* ``run`` never sets an approval mode. ``HEADLESS`` resolves to ``HOOK_BASED``, whose
  fall-through in ``llm_helpers._resolve_permission`` is auto-approve — so approval
  alone is NOT a containment boundary here, and the task-mode gate is what contains.

    1. ``SessionManager.set_task_mode``'s own docstring: "ACP runtimes are gated in the
       dashboard permission handler instead (they have no such setter)" — so an ACP
       runtime never receives the task mode.
    2. That dashboard-side gate (``chat_runner``'s ``task_mode_denies`` call) fires only
       on an ``EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST`` frame.
    3. An unattended turn — which every ``inbound:cli:`` turn is, by construction —
       makes ``chat_runner`` set ``acp_mode = "bypassPermissions"``, whose entire purpose
       is to stop the dialect asking so a background run cannot wedge on a human.

    So the one gate that could enforce read-only on an ACP runtime is the one the
    unattended posture switches off. Announcing "read-only" and then running an ACP
    agent with permissions bypassed would be a worse defect than not offering the mode:
    the operator would have a written promise and no enforcement. Suppressing the bypass
    instead is not an option — the turn would hang forever waiting for an approval no
    human is there to give.

    Fail-closed: refuse, and name ``--allow`` as the explicit way to proceed. ``--allow``
    is honest about what an ACP headless turn actually is (a full grant), so the operator
    opts into the posture they are really getting instead of inheriting it silently.

    No WS frame carries token counts, so the count comes from the ledger the gateway
    writes under ``config_dir()/usage/turns.jsonl`` — readable here precisely because
    ``run`` requires sharing the gateway's home (see ``mint_local_token``). Best-effort:
    a missing ledger reports 0 rather than failing a turn that already succeeded.

    🔴 The ledger keys rows by the DASHBOARD-WRAPPED provider key
    (``dashboard:inbound:cli:<id>``), not by the session name. Querying the bare key
    matched nothing and reported a confident ``"tokens": 0`` on a turn that had really
    billed 22,979 — a decorative field, not a measured one. ``dashboard_session_key`` is
    the shared wrapper, so the query cannot drift from the write site. It is imported from
    ``constants``, NOT from ``dashboard.chat_utils``: reaching up into the HTTP surface for
    a naming rule is the inversion ``core-must-not-import-the-http-surface`` exists to
    catch, and the gate caught it here.
