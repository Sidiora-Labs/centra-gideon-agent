"""Local static artifact deploy — the webapp serve registry and path spine (PEP-8).

Deploying an artifact makes its own bytes reachable at a stable in-gateway URL
(``/artifacts/serve/<slug>/``) so an html/widget artifact can be opened and driven
as a real page instead of only rendered inside a chat bubble. Local-only: public
exposure is explicitly out of scope, so the route sits behind the same session auth
as every other gateway path (``/artifacts/`` is in no auth-bypass prefix).

Three properties are load-bearing here, because this route serves
**model- or user-authored HTML** rather than shipped assets:

*Containment.* A request path is resolved and asserted to live under the artifact's
own files root — never string-matched against ``..``. Marker rejection
(``..``/absolute/backslash/percent-encoded traversal) is a cheap first gate; the
resolve-and-contain assertion is the one that actually holds, and a symlink is
refused outright so the served set can never point outside the root.

*The CSP fence.* The served document is fenced like a widget iframe:
``connect-src 'none'`` means the page cannot call the gateway ``/api`` at all,
and ``form-action``/``base-uri``/``object-src`` are shut so it cannot exfiltrate
by navigation either. It is the response header (not a ``<meta>`` the document
could omit) that carries the fence, because the document is untrusted input.

*Teardown removes the route.* aiohttp freezes its router at startup, so the
"route" a user can tear down is this registry: the handler serves nothing for a
slug that is not deployed, and deleting an artifact tears its deployment down.
An artifact deleted but still reachable is precisely the defect the teardown
clause exists to prevent.

Persistence lives at ``<home>/artifacts/deployments.json`` — inside the artifacts
tree, so the existing ``artifacts`` durability inventory entry already covers it
and the provider's directory-only ``list`` ignores it (same bargain as
``folders.json``).

#:
#: * ``default-src 'none'`` — nothing is fetchable unless a directive below allows it.
#: * ``connect-src 'none'`` — no fetch/XHR/WebSocket/EventSource/sendBeacon at all,
#:   so the page cannot call ``/api`` even though it is same-origin.
#: * ``form-action 'none'`` + ``base-uri 'none'`` — no exfiltration by form POST and
#:   no rewriting relative URLs out from under the other directives.
#: * ``frame-ancestors 'self'`` — embeddable in the dashboard's own pane, nowhere else.
