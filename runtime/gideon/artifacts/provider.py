"""Abstract base for artifact providers.

Mirrors the Task/Prompt entity shape: a thin ABC over a backend (filesystem,
object store, remote service). The bundled :class:`NativeArtifactProvider` is the
on-disk implementation; the REST/MCP/CLI layers all dispatch through the
registry so a second backend drops in with no caller change.

The interface is synchronous: the native provider is filesystem I/O under a
coarse lock, and the in-process MCP tools call it directly. Async backends can
wrap their I/O; nothing in the call sites awaits a provider method.
