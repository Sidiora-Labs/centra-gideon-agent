"""Schedule run history — the ``ScheduleRun`` sub-entity + ``ScheduleRunStore``.

A ``ScheduleRun`` is a sub-entity of the Schedule entity: the persistent record
of one execution of a Schedule Job (status / timing / trigger / summary /
trace). It is the unit a future ``ScheduleProvider`` would ``list_runs`` /
``get_run`` — the read API on :class:`ScheduleRunStore` is deliberately shaped
like ``TaskProvider.list_tasks`` / ``get_task`` (returns ``(rows, total)``), so
the ABC can adopt it unchanged when the Schedule entity is put behind a provider
interface.

Persistence is JSONL-per-job (a first-class Gideon idiom — cf. ``sel.py``,
``learn.py``, ``history.py``): ``<dir>/cron-history/{job_id}.jsonl`` holds full
records (with trace); ``_index.jsonl`` holds lightweight rows (no trace) for the
cross-job Executions view. Writes take an fcntl advisory lock (mirroring
``ScheduleService._file_lock``); reads are lock-free — a partial final line from
a concurrent append is silently skipped by the ``JSONDecodeError`` handler.
