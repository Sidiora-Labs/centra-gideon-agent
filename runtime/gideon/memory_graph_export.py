"""Self-contained HTML export of the memory entity graph (MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §7.2).

One file you can mail, archive, or open in five years: the graph drawn as inline SVG, the
legend, and the underlying JSON embedded verbatim so the picture and its data never separate.

**No script, by design — and that IS a deviation from the plan's sketch.** §7.2 describes an
interactive `graph.html` with the JSON embedded for a client-side renderer. This repo already
answered that question for exports in ``knowledge/reports.py``: an exported document that can
execute "is worse than a missing export — it is a rendered page the user has been told is a
report". So the layout is computed HERE and the export ships as static SVG, and the same
:func:`assert_self_contained` invariant that guards knowledge reports guards this one. Reusing
that guard rather than writing a second forbidden-pattern list is deliberate: two lists drift,
and the one that drifts is the one nobody is reading when it matters.

The JSON travels inside an HTML comment rather than a ``<script type="application/json">``
block for exactly that reason — the guard refuses any ``<script`` at all, and a data island
that can only exist by weakening the guard is not worth the convenience.
