"""The evals store layout + helpers (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §1.1).

Everything lives under ``~/.gideon/evals/``. Whole-file JSON artifacts
(``experiment.json``/``aggregates.json``/``trials.json`` per matrix) go through
``atomic_write``; the cross-run ``results.tsv`` ledger is append-only — a plain
``open(..., "a")`` with the parent ensured, matching how the guardrails audit
appends its jsonl.

ES-1a physically supports the ``matrices/`` subtree and the ``results.tsv`` ledger;
ES-2 adds the ``scenarios/`` subtree (the versioned Loop-1 library — see
:mod:`gideon.evals.scenarios`). ES-4 added ``benchmarks/`` and ES-5 adds
``studies/`` (the pre-registered A/B studies of §2 — registration, hidden ``locked/``
checks, verdict, per-run artifacts). ``trust/`` is still unowned and still NOT
created here, because a dir with no writer is dead scaffolding. The single
``StateEntry`` for ``evals`` (in ``durability/inventory.py``) claims the whole tree
for backup regardless of which subtrees exist yet.

ES-2 also makes the ledger PINNED: :func:`append_result` takes a required ``pin``
and refuses a row whose pin is absent or incomplete. That refusal is the one
chokepoint every future writer (matrix, study, gate) passes through, so "a run
without a pin cannot be written to results.tsv" holds for writers that do not exist
yet.
