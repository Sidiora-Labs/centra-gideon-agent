"""Budgeted search over Gideon's own harness artifacts (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §8, ES-11).

The proactive half of the eval substrate: a hill-climbing search that tries to improve one
of Gideon's *own* artifacts — a workflow template's prompt blocks, a skill body, an SOP —
and hands the winner to a human as a proposal. The bundled ``optimize-harness`` template is
the declarative packaging; this module is the machinery its nodes call.

Four properties make the difference between a search and a liability, and each is a
mechanism here rather than a promise in a prompt:

* **Nothing live mutates.** Candidates are written into a throwaway sandbox and only ever
  read from the live artifact. :class:`LiveWitness` records the bytes of the live artifact
  (and any other path the caller names) BEFORE the search and re-reads them after; a
  mismatch raises :class:`LiveMutationError`. That is deliberately an *observation* and not
  an assertion of intent: a search that wrote into the live tree and then restored it would
  fail this check, which is the only version of the guarantee worth having.
* **A frozen-region touch is fatal regardless of score.** :func:`scope_check` reuses the
  engine's own snapshot/diff (``workflows.scope``) and adds the one rule the engine's
  ``allowed_write_paths`` cannot express on its own: a *frozen* root — the live artifact and
  its ``.gideon-lock.json`` — is a violation even when it is also inside an allowed root.
  Frozen wins over allowed, because "allowed" is a scoping default and "frozen" is a
  decision.
* **The gate is DUAL.** :class:`DualGate` admits a candidate only when it clears BOTH the
  harvested-suite threshold AND the monotonic best-ever score read from ``results.tsv``.
  Either half alone is decoration: the threshold alone re-admits a candidate that already
  lost to a better one, and best-ever alone admits a candidate that beats a bad incumbent
  while still failing the suite. The best-ever floor is captured ONCE, before the search
  starts (:func:`capture_best_ever`) — a floor recomputed from the rows the search is
  writing would be pinned by the value it is meant to pin, and would rise to whatever the
  last candidate scored.
* **The search halts.** Three declared conditions, three call sites in :func:`run_search`:
  ``hypothesis_abandon_after`` (the same fix attempted N× — the diagnosis is wrong),
  ``no_improvement_halt`` (N consecutive iterations that did not improve on the best score
  at the start of the window), and ``budget_usd`` (the guardrails :class:`SpendMeter`
  ceiling). A fourth, ``max_iterations``, is the trivial floor under all three.

The stop-condition arithmetic is deliberately the SAME shape as
:mod:`gideon.loop.tick`'s ``hypothesis_exhausted`` / ``no_progress`` detectors —
identical fixes in a window, and a progress window whose max never rises above its first
mark. Two dialects of "it stopped improving" would be one more than this codebase can
afford; the subjects differ (loop cycles there, search candidates here) but the rule does
not.
