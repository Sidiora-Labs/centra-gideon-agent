"""The harness-ablation runner (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §3.1).

Harness components compensate for model weaknesses whose assumptions expire silently.
Nothing else in PClaw can answer "does this judge / hint / stage still pay for itself?".
This module answers it on a cadence, for ONE component per run, and files the answer as a
proposal — it never edits anything.

The shape:

1. :func:`pick_component` takes ONE row from the registry, round-robin (§3.1 step 1's
   one-at-a-time rule, applied to measurement as well as to removal).
2. :func:`run_ablation` replays that component's benchmark through the ES-1b matrix runner
   with an ``arm_mask`` axis — ``on`` / ``off`` (/ ``cheap``). The toggle is a
   :class:`~gideon.evals.overlay.ComponentOverlay` applied ONLY inside the spawned
   child (:func:`gideon.evals.overlay.apply_in_child`).
3. :func:`classify` turns the per-arm means into ``keep`` / ``remove`` / ``lighten``.
4. A ``remove`` verdict's report is attached to a LEARN-R9 ``retirement`` proposal as the
   ablation-grade evidence R9 requires (:func:`file_retirement_proposal`).

**The load-bearing negative: the live spec/config is never mutated.** Editing the real
config to toggle a component off and editing it back is the obvious implementation and it
is forbidden — a crash between the two edits leaves the operator's configuration silently
altered. So every run executes inside :func:`live_state_unchanged`, which digests the live
files before and after and raises :class:`LiveStateMutatedError` on any drift **including
after a run that raised** (the drift replaces the original error, with it chained as the
cause: a run that both failed and altered live state is a config incident first).
