"""What DRIVES a pre-registered template study — EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §2 (ES-5).

:mod:`gideon.evals.studies` is the instrument: pre-registration, the `locked/` check
DSL, the rubric pin, the blinded position-swapped judge, the verdict. It had no driver —
``ArmRunner`` was a bare type alias and ``arm_runner`` a required kwarg with no default, so
no template arm could execute and nothing in production imported ``run_study`` at all. This
module is the driver, and it owns exactly four seams:

1. **The harvested-suite adapter** (:func:`harvested_study_cases`). §2's corpus is
   ES's harvested regression suite. ``harvest.load_harvested_suite`` RAISES
   :class:`~gideon.evals.harvest.EmptyHarvestError` rather than returning ``[]`` — a
   caller that got a list and compared it to a threshold would report a green it never
   measured. So the refusal is caught HERE, once, and turned into a suite that says
   ``refusal`` out loud and carries the ``low_power`` label; it is never turned into zero
   cases that read like a passing study.

2. **The arm prompt** (:func:`render_arm_prompt`) — the ONE place a template body becomes
   the text an arm executes. Bindings are resolved through the engine's own
   :func:`gideon.workflows.bindings.resolve`, never a second interpolation dialect,
   and the case's recorded inputs are the thing held STILL while the template varies. That
   direction matters: for a retrieval or skills A/B you hold the prompt still and vary the
   arm, which is why the harvest records ``resolved_prompt_ref``; for a TEMPLATE A/B the
   template is the variable by definition.

3. **The production ``ArmRunner``** (:class:`TemplateArmRunner` / :func:`live_arm_runner`),
   the one function here that spends money, deliberately shaped like ES-4's
   ``live_judge_caller``: one ``one_shot_completion`` on the arm's rendered prompt, wall
   time measured here, cost read back off the guard's attempt audit. Each arm run gets its
   OWN output workspace and the response is written into it, so §2.2's supervisor-side
   `locked/` checks have a real tree to check and the two arms' trees are distinct.

4. **The vacuity gate** (:func:`assert_arms_differ`). An A/B whose two arms render the same
   prompt measures nothing, and it does not fail — it reports a confident `tie`. That is
   the single worst artifact this module could produce, because it is indistinguishable
   from an honest tie. So a study whose arms render identically for EVERY case is refused
   before arm 1, and the count of cases whose arms actually differ is carried in the
   preflight where a reader sees it.

🔴 **What an arm is, stated so nobody has to infer it.** An arm here is ONE model call on
the template's rendered prompt — not a full multi-node engine run. That is a deliberate
bound, not an oversight: :func:`gideon.workflows.service.start_run` requires a live
supervisor, which only a running gateway wires (``gateway.py`` sets
``ActionServices.workflows`` from the workflow watchdog), so an engine-driven arm would be
permanently inert in the CLI — the one surface §2's spend preflight exists for. A
prompt-level arm is also what a refiner diff actually changes: ``refiner.check_diff``
freezes ``id``/``triggers``/surfacing metadata, so the legal ops move prompt text. A
trajectory-level arm is a real extension, and it belongs to whoever builds the headless
engine driver.
