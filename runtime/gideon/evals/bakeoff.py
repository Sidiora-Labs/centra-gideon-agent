"""The model bake-off (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §7, ES-10).

Answers one question with the user's OWN traffic instead of a leaderboard: *for this
use case, which of these candidate models actually does the job, and at what cost?* It
samples real inputs the use case has seen, runs each candidate model over them, scores
the outputs, and writes a per-use-case recommendation the user reads and then applies
BY HAND (rebinding ``active_models.json`` in Settings → Models). It never rewrites the
routing itself — that separation is the whole point of §7: the bake-off proposes, the
human disposes, so a surprising recommendation is inspected before it changes behaviour.

Structurally this is the judge benchmark's twin (:mod:`gideon.evals.judge_bench`),
and deliberately so — both run a subject across an axis, invoke models through the ONE
money-spending caller, read cost from the attempt audit rather than a token count they
cannot see, and score into the shared :class:`~gideon.evals.matrix.CellResult` /
:func:`~gideon.evals.matrix.aggregate` shape. It does NOT go through
:func:`~gideon.evals.runner.run_matrix`: that runner exists to contain scenario
execution in an isolated child home, and a bake-off scores a raw completion, not a
scenario — the same reason ``judge_bench`` and ``retrieval_bench`` own their loops.

Input sampling has two paths, and only the first spends nothing:

* The **attempt audit** (``model_calls.jsonl``) records which models a use case ran and
  what they cost, but NOT the prompt bodies — so it seeds the candidate axis and the
  current-cost baseline, never the inputs to replay.
* **Capture** (:func:`capture_input`) is how real inputs become available, and it is OFF
  by default (``EvalsConfig.bakeoff_capture_enabled``). When on, each input is redacted
  before it touches disk, the store is size- and count-capped, and every record carries a
  timestamp so :func:`load_captured_inputs` can drop anything past the TTL. The capture
  directory is owner-only (0700) and excluded from every export/snapshot, so a redacted
  excerpt of the user's traffic never leaves the machine.
