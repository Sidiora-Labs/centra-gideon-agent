"""The skill-impact benchmark: the frozen task register, its reports, and V4 reproduction.

`docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` is PROTOCOL v1 — owner-signed on
2026-08-16, before any run, including the commitment to publish a modest or negative result.
This module is the shipped half of executing it: the frozen ten-task register, the preflight
that says whether a paired run is runnable *before* a model is called, report persistence, and
the §8 reproduction predicate.

**What is deliberately NOT here: the verdict.** The protocol's §5 thresholds live in
`harness/fanout_measure.py`, and `harness` is a repo-root dev package that does not ship in the
wheel — so importing it from `src/` would strand an import at install time. The verdict is
computed by the runner (`scripts/learning_benchmark.py`, through `harness/learning_verdict.py`)
and **written into the report**. Everything downstream — this module, the gateway route, the
dashboard panel — only ever READS a verdict string.

That is not a workaround, it is the property worth having. A surface that cannot recompute a
verdict cannot invent one. A report with no verdict therefore renders as *"not measured"*, and
the one failure mode this benchmark most needs to avoid — drawing `0.000` where nothing was
measured, turning "we never asked" into "it scored nothing" — is unreachable by construction.

Isolation: every paired trial runs as a matrix cell in a spawned child whose
``GIDEON_HOME`` is a per-cell temp dir seeded from the scenario's declared
``fixture_home``. Nothing here reads or writes the operator's skills. The protocol's §3 forbids
`gideon eval` for benchmark runs for exactly that reason — it isolates the workspace but
not the home — and this module never reaches it.

#: Bump ONLY with the register below, and never for a code change. §2.3: adding, removing or

#: **v2 (ES-6):** all ten register scenarios joined the Loop-2 gate tier (``"tiers": ["gate"]``).
#: Their turns and assertions are untouched, so the tasks themselves are unchanged — but the tag
#: moved every one of their ``scenario_sha256`` values, which IS the mechanical anchor above, and
#: the library backfill is version-keyed, so an existing home only picks the tag up on a bump.
#: The integer has to follow the anchor rather than contradict it: leaving it at 1 would claim
#: these are the same subjects v1 measured while the anchor says otherwise. Nothing real is
