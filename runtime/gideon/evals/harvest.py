"""The harvested regression suite — real runs turned into scenario-library cases.

Every eval instrument in this package so far scores against AUTHORED inputs: the four shipped
scenarios in :mod:`gideon.evals.scenarios`, the judge fixture sets in
:mod:`gideon.evals.judge_bench`. That is fine for a smoke test and useless as a regression
suite, because the thing a template regresses on is the work the user actually asked for. A suite
that has to be hand-written is a suite nobody grows, and a study run over four authored scenarios
is measuring the authors.

This module is the missing direction: **ledger → scenario**. It reads terminal runs out of the Run
Ledger and emits one scenario per run, in the library's own shape, so everything the library
already does — canonical-JSON hashing (`scenarios.sha256_of_scenario_data`), the manifest
(`scenarios.read_manifest`), fixture-home resolution, `gideon eval` itself — applies to a
harvested case with no new machinery.

Four properties are load-bearing, and each is here because its absence is a specific failure this
repo has already shipped once:

**Inputs come from the LEDGER, never from the run row.** `WorkflowRun.inputs` is a SQLite column
written straight from the API request; `run_started.inputs` is the same dict after the ledger
writer's `redact()`. They are equal in content and NOT equal in safety, so a run with no
`run_started` record is reported unharvestable rather than harvested off the row. That single rule
is what makes "a harvested scenario cannot contain a credential" a property of the read path rather
than a hope. Each raw source is screened through :func:`_screen` exactly ONCE, at its point of
entry — a trailing pass over the composed case would garble its own output, which :func:`_screen`
explains and a test pins.

**`run_started`/`run_finished` are journal-only.** They are outside
:data:`~gideon.ledger.kinds.LEDGER_KINDS`, so the `events.jsonl` mirror never carries them
and :func:`~gideon.ledger.reader.read_events` returns `[]` for them — which reads exactly
like "the run had no inputs". :data:`JOURNAL_KINDS` and :data:`EVENT_KINDS` name the split, and
:func:`~gideon.ledger.reader.journal_only_kinds` is asserted against it, so the day a kind
moves between the two the test fails instead of the harvest silently going quiet.

**Provenance is mandatory.** Each case carries the run id, the workflow name and the `event_id` of
every record it was built from. A study that cannot name its population is the fabricated-evidence
shape — the same one ES-7's config-target refusal exists to prevent — and a case with no run id is
indistinguishable from an invented one.

**An empty population is a refusal, not a suite of zero.** :func:`load_harvested_suite` RAISES on an
empty suite rather than returning `[]`, because `[]` scored against a threshold reads as a pass.
:class:`HarvestReport` says `no replay population` in as many words, which is not the same statement
as a zero delta.

Writes are an idempotent, content-keyed backfill in the house style (`_init_schema`'s
`IF NOT EXISTS`, `vector_memory._MIGRATIONS`): a case's content is derived purely from the run, so
re-harvesting the same run produces byte-identical JSON and the write is skipped. Nothing here can
touch a packaged scenario — every harvested name carries :data:`HARVEST_PREFIX`, and
:func:`_target_path` refuses a collision with the shipped library outright.
