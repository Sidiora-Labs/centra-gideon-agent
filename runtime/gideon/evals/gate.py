"""Loop-2 regression gating — the cheap gate subset + before/after proposal columns (ES-6).

The amendment names three loops. Loop 1 (studies, §2) says *"should be better"*; Loop 3
(field metrics, §9) says *"is"*. Loop 2 is the cheap tier between a change and shipping:
a curated subset of the Loop-1 scenario library, re-run twice — once over the home as it
is, once with the candidate artifact staged — so a proposal carries ``{before, after, pin}``
before the user decides.

## What this module is NOT

It is not a second runner. Every score here comes from :func:`gideon.evals.runner.run_matrix`
through :mod:`gideon.evals.child`, one matrix per (arm × scenario) at ``trial_count=1``,
exactly as :mod:`gideon.evals.skills_bench` and :mod:`gideon.evals.ablation` do.
What this module adds is the *selection*, the *arm staging*, and the *bound*.

## How the dozen is declared, and why not a subdirectory

The amendment sketched ``evals/scenarios/gate/``. The installed library is a FLAT directory
that three readers glob (``gideon eval``, the matrix runner's resolver,
:func:`gideon.evals.scenarios.install_library`), and none of them descends: a scenario
in a subdir would be invisible to ``resolve_scenario_path`` and absent from the library
manifest. So membership is declared IN the scenario, as ``"tiers": ["gate"]`` — the same
data-keyed shape ``version``, ``fixture_home`` and the ``harvest`` provenance block already
use, and the rule ``scenarios.origin_of`` states outright: derive it by inspecting the data,
never from a side list of names. One consequence is recorded rather than hidden: adding the
field changes each scenario's ``scenario_sha256``, so a shipped scenario that joins the tier
also bumps its ``version`` (else the idempotent backfill would never reinstall it) and its
prior ledger rows sit under the older hash. That is what the pin is FOR — "did anything
change" is a pin-diff query.

## Why "fast" and "judge-light" are structural, not promised

* **Fast**: a tagged scenario over :data:`MAX_GATE_TURNS` turns is EXCLUDED with a reason.
  A gate whose cost is a claim in a docstring is a gate users learn to skip.
* **Judge-light**: the child runs ``EvalRunner(judge_enabled=False)``, which *filters* judge
  assertions out of the scored set (``eval/runner.py``). A scenario whose only assertions are
  ``judge`` therefore scores ``total_assertions == 0`` and falls back to ``1.0`` — a fabricated
  perfect score. So a tagged scenario with no non-judge assertion is excluded too. "Judge-light"
  is not a style preference here; it is the difference between a score and a fiction.

## How the bound is ENFORCED

``SpendMeter`` is the chokepoint, not a second tally:

1. an unbudgeted gate does not run *unbounded* — it does not run at all, and the proposal
   reads ``ungated``. ``0`` means UNLIMITED to :class:`~gideon.guardrails.budgets.Budget`,
   which is the one thing a pre-ship gate must never be;
2. before every cell, :meth:`SpendMeter.check_run` is consulted and an ``EXCEEDED`` verdict
   STOPS the sweep — the scenarios that did not run are named in the report rather than
   silently omitted;
3. after every cell, the child's OWN reported spend (``child.spend_from_home``, read inside
   the throwaway home before the parent deletes it) is charged to the meter under the gate's
   run key. Charge → check → stop, all through the meter, so the ceiling that bites is the
   real one.

The matrix spec's own ``budget_usd`` is deliberately left at 0: its preflight is DAY-scoped
(``_budget_blocks_cell`` → ``check_day``), and comparing a per-gate ceiling against a whole
day's spend would refuse the gate for spend that had nothing to do with it. One bound, one rule.

## Why "ungated" never blocks

A gate that failed closed on its own absence would stop a user shipping a proposal because
the *gate* broke — evals off, no model bound, no budget, an empty subset. Every one of those
is a legible ``ungated`` state with a reason a user can act on, and none of them touches
:func:`gideon.learning.proposals.accept`. The word is the atom's own; the *score cells*
render with the panels' house string ("not measured") rather than a ``0.0``.

And the pin is never invented. :func:`~gideon.evals.pinning.RunPin.is_complete` is a
precondition: a home with no bound model has no honest ``model_fingerprint``, and minting one
would poison every per-fingerprint baseline reading the same ``results.tsv``. An unavailable
pin is the ungated case, not a fabricated one.
