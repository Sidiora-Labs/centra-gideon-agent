"""The skills/templates impact bench (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §3.3).

OpenJarvis' ``jarvis bench skills`` measurement, on this repo's machinery: for a given
skill, replay the runs that ACTUALLY loaded it — the WF2-R13 ``consulted`` ledger event
says which — with the skill **surfaced vs suppressed**, and report the outcome delta.

Two things make this bench honest rather than decorative:

1. **Suppression is verified, not assumed.** A "suppressed" arm whose prompt still carries
   the skill body measures nothing and reports a delta of ~0 — which reads exactly like a
   skill that does not matter, the wrong conclusion drawn confidently.
   :func:`verify_suppression` assembles the real prompt blocks through the real allocator
   (:func:`gideon.skills.allocation.allocate_skills`) for both arms and checks that
   the body is present in the surfaced arm and absent from the suppressed one. The
   PRESENCE half is not decoration: an empty prompt set satisfies "the body is absent"
   trivially, so the negative is only evidence when paired with the positive.
2. **An unverified suppression refuses to produce a verdict.** :func:`bench_skill` returns
   ``INCONCLUSIVE`` with a reason instead of a delta, on the §1.2 principle that a
   measurement that could not run is never reported as a zero.

Arm vocabulary: "surfaced"/"suppressed" is how §3.3 SAYS on/off for a skill, so it is an
ALIAS of the shared :mod:`gideon.evals.overlay` arms, not a second dialect. Minting a
second set of arm names would give the substrate two vocabularies for one axis.
