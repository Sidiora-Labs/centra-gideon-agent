"""The experiment-matrix CHILD entrypoint (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §1.2/§1.3).

``run_matrix`` (:mod:`gideon.evals.runner`) spawns one of these per cell:

    python -m gideon.evals.child <descriptor.json>

The §1.3 isolation fix lives HERE by construction: the parent sets
``GIDEON_WORKSPACE`` in *this child's* spawn env only, so this process is
already pointed at the per-cell workspace before any code runs. We reuse
:class:`~gideon.eval.runner.EvalRunner` unchanged (``workspace_dir=`` reads
the same path), run ONE cell's scenario, and emit its raw result as a
sentinel-prefixed JSON line on stdout for the parent to read back. The parent
process's ``os.environ`` is never mutated — that is the whole point of §1.3.

ES-6 adds one more thing this child does before the run: it stages the Loop-2 gate's
before/after ARM (:mod:`gideon.evals.gate`) into its throwaway home, so the candidate
artifact under test exists only inside this cell.

Crash / infra-error contract: any failure emits an ``{"ok": false}`` result AND
exits non-zero, so the parent maps the cell to ``VERIFIER_ABSENT`` (never a false
``FAILED``). A clean scenario run emits ``{"ok": true, "passed": ..., "score": ...}``.
