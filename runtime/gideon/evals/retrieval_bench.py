"""Retrieval eval harness with per-arm P@k/R@k ablation (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §5 / ES-3).

One arm-masked runner, TWO stores, run separately and read-only:

* **knowledge** — :class:`~gideon.knowledge.retrieval.HybridRetriever` over
  ``knowledge.db``: the FTS5 keyword arm, the entity-graph arm and the vector arm,
  RRF-fused;
* **memory** — :meth:`~gideon.vector_memory.VectorMemoryStore.rank_semantic` over
  ``memory.db``: the same three arm names over the ``0.6·vec + 0.4·kw`` hybrid plus
  MEMORY-GRAPH's graph boost.

The two stores never share a corpus, never cross-query, and neither is written: §5.1's
KNOWLEDGE/MEMORY boundary. Fixtures, qrels and reports are harness mechanics under
``~/.gideon/evals/`` — no eval artifact is a memory entry or a knowledge item.

**Arms are named ONCE.** :data:`ARMS` is asserted at import against
``knowledge.retrieval.ARMS`` and ``vector_memory.RECALL_ARMS``, because "the graph arm's
contribution" must mean the same thing in both halves of one report.

**A metric over an empty candidate set is not a score.** ``P@k`` of an empty result list
is ``0/0`` — it is :data:`None` here, with :data:`REASON_NO_CANDIDATES` recorded, and the
cell is ``VERIFIER_ABSENT`` so :func:`~gideon.evals.matrix.aggregate` cannot average
it in as a zero. ``R@k`` of an empty result list is a real ``0.0`` (none of the known
relevant ids was found) and is scored as such; ``R@k`` is ``None`` only when the qrels
declare no relevant id at all. That asymmetry is the whole point: "no candidates" and "0
relevant" are different facts and a report that spells them the same way is a report you
cannot act on.

**A mask that gates nothing is detected by the run, not by a test.** Every run includes a
CONTROL cell with every arm masked off. It must retrieve nothing. If it retrieves
anything, the mask never reached the retriever and every per-arm delta in the report is
noise — so the run raises :class:`MaskNotAppliedError` instead of publishing.

**Weak labels, and their bias, stated.** Qrels are mined from events, never synthesized
from the arms' own inputs: knowledge from ``intent_outcomes`` (an ingest-time LLM match
against an item's consolidated content — it does not consult retrieval, so it is not
circular), memory from ``mem_volunteer_events`` via
:meth:`~gideon.memory_graph.MemoryGraph.volunteer_qrels` (retrieved-then-used).
Deliberately NOT implemented: §5.2's source (c), synthetic entity queries from the alias
table. Both stores' graph arms take entity mentions as their INPUT, so a qrels set built
from mentions would score the graph arm against its own index and manufacture the very
"+P@5 from the graph arm" finding the report exists to test. See the plan's ES-3 log.
