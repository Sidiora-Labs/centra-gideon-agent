"""The voice-clone ENGINE bake-off (MULTIMODAL-IO §2.2, atom MI-6).

Answers the one question MI-2 §2.2 deferred: *for a local, macOS-first, cloning-first
personal assistant, which zero-shot voice-clone engine do we ship in
``apps/voice-clone-tts`` — k2-fsa OmniVoice or FunAudioLLM CosyVoice — and why is the
other rejected?* It scores the two candidates over a fixed criteria matrix and prints a
recommendation plus the loser's rejection notes.

This is NOT the ES-10 traffic bake-off (:mod:`gideon.evals.bakeoff`). That one
replays the user's OWN LLM traffic through candidate *routing* models. This one is a
one-shot *engine-selection* spike over two local TTS engines: a pure, deterministic,
offline scorecard with no model call and no network, plus an OPT-IN measurement path
(:func:`measure_fixture_rtf`) that runs real fixture inference when an engine and its
weights are actually installed and degrades to a clearly-reasoned skip otherwise.

**Honesty contract (the reason this file is careful about provenance).** Every cell
carries a :class:`Provenance`. Two things are kept strictly apart:

* the ``raw`` published value — LITERATURE, cited to a real URL, or UNKNOWN when the
  vendor does not publish it (never invented); and
* the ``score`` in ``[0, 1]`` — the reviewer's JUDGMENT mapping of that evidence onto
  *this* product's use case, documented in the companion plan doc.

No benchmark number in here was measured on the authoring host — the fixture-axis
measurements MI-6 ultimately wants (MPS latency, RAM) are DEFERRED to the follow-up
implementation run and are represented as measure-deferred metrics, not guesses. When
:func:`measure_fixture_rtf` cannot run it says so; it never fabricates a latency.
