"""RunPin — the identity of one eval run (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE amendment E1).

A score without a pin is not evidence: "the template got better" is unreadable if
the scenario, the bound model, the prompt text or the config could have moved
underneath it. Every matrix/study/gate run therefore computes a pin BEFORE it runs
anything, persists it beside the run's artifacts, and carries it on the
``results.tsv`` row — :func:`gideon.evals.store.append_result` refuses a row
without one, so an unpinned result cannot enter the ledger at all.

The four parts the amendment names:

* ``scenario_sha256`` — canonical-JSON hash of the scenario file (see
  :mod:`gideon.evals.scenarios`); reformatting does not move it, editing an
  assertion does.
* ``model_fingerprint`` — per-use-case ``Provider:model`` read from
  ``active_models.json``. Rebinding a model changes the fingerprint (and therefore
  :meth:`RunPin.model_fp`) while the scenario hash stays put: that pair is exactly
  the pin-diff query "did anything change".

  This names the **INVOKING HOME's** binding, and that is all it has ever named. #2561 measured
  the consequence: two runs from one bound home — one with ``--bind-provider``, one without,
  where every cell failed with ``ProviderResolutionError`` — carried the identical
  ``model_fp`` ``5970c589da34``, because the flag never reached the pin. So the cells' reach is
  a SECOND fact under its own name (``cell_model_fingerprint`` /
  :meth:`RunPin.cell_model_fp`), never an overload of this one: two facts, two fields.
* ``prompt_pack_sha256`` — hash over the RESOLVED prompt pack: for every shipped
  prompt/snippet, the home's copy when it exists (the user edited it) else the
  packaged one, plus any home-only additions.
* ``config_snapshot_ref`` — hash over the relevant ``AppConfig`` subset (the evals
  section), so a knob change that moves scores is visible in the pin.

Two further parts are pinned because ES-2 made them part of a run's identity:
``fixture_home`` (the named seed the run executes over) and ``library_version``.

This module deliberately does NOT fail soft. If the pin cannot be computed, the
caller must refuse to run rather than produce an unattributable score.
