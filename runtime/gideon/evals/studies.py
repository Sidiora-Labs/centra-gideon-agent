"""Pre-registered template A/B studies — EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §2 (ES-5).

The formal instrument for "is template v(N+1) actually better than v(N)?". Every clause
below exists because a cheaper version of it can be gamed, so the module is organized
around the four defeats rather than around the happy path:

1. **§2.1 immutable pre-registration.** The design is fixed before arm 1 runs, and
   `store.write_study_registration` refuses a second write. The load-bearing part is not
   the file mode — it is that the RUBRIC is pinned by hash: :func:`rubric_status` compares
   the live rubric AND the on-disk pinned copy against `rubric_sha256`, and either mismatch
   yields verdict ``invalidated``. A study whose rubric can be edited after the results are
   in is a study that was never registered, only narrated.

2. **§2.3 blinded, position-swapped, median-of-3.** Three separate biases, three separate
   mechanisms. Blinding: :func:`render_pair_prompt` is given the rubric and two outputs and
   *nothing else*, and :func:`assert_blinded` asserts the negative over the registration's
   own identifying strings. Position swap: EVERY pair is judged twice with the slots
   exchanged, and a pair whose winner flips is `no_signal` — not a win for whoever sat in
   slot A. Median-of-3: each presentation is sampled `DEFAULT_JUDGE_SAMPLES` times and the
   ordinal median decides, so one eccentric sample cannot carry a pair.

3. **§2.3 agreement floor.** A median-of-3 with no floor launders disagreement into a
   verdict. Below `evals.judge_agreement_floor` the study's verdict is `judge_unreliable`
   and it files a judge-calibration item instead of a template verdict.

4. 🔴 **§2.2 `locked/` checks are supervisor-side and never worker-visible.** A check whose
   text reaches the worker is a check the worker satisfies by construction, which is the
   same as not having it. So the checks run HERE, in the arm's own output workspace, after
   the run finishes — and :func:`assert_no_locked_leakage` asserts the NEGATIVE over every
   worker-visible string before a single arm is spawned. That guard REFUSES to pass
   vacuously: no locked tokens to look for, or no non-empty strings offered to scan, is
   itself an error, because a negative assertion over an empty set is not an assertion.
   :class:`WorkerPayload` derives its scanned surface from its own dataclass fields, so a
   field added later is scanned by DEFAULT — forgetting to declare it is safe rather than a
   silent hole.

Nothing here is a new verdict dialect. The engine's `judge_contract.Verdict` answers "did
this work meet its definition of done" over PASS/REJECT/RETRY/…; a study answers "is B
better than A", which that vocabulary cannot express, so the two do not overlap and neither
is translated into the other. What IS reused verbatim: `DEFAULT_JUDGE_SAMPLES` (the sample
count), `parse_judge_json` (JSON extraction and its reject-by-default posture), ES-4's
`JudgeCall`/`live_judge_caller` seam (the one place a judge costs money), and
`loop.gates.run_verify_command` (the screened tristate every locked command runs through,
so a check that cannot run reports `verifier_absent` and never a silent pass).
