"""Child-process component overlays (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §3.1 step 2).

The ablation runner measures a harness component by running the same benchmark with
that component ON and OFF. The obvious implementation — edit the live spec/config,
run, edit it back — is FORBIDDEN: a crash between the two edits leaves the operator's
configuration silently altered, and "the runner never edits anything" (§3.1 step 4) is
the plan's rule.

So a toggle is an **overlay that exists only inside the child process**:

1. the parent serializes a :class:`ComponentOverlay` into the child's spawn env
   (:data:`OVERLAY_ENV`) — on the ``os.environ.copy()`` the matrix runner already
   builds for ``GIDEON_WORKSPACE``/``GIDEON_HOME``, so the parent's own
   env is untouched;
2. the child calls :func:`apply_in_child`, which writes ONLY into the throwaway
   per-cell ``GIDEON_HOME`` the parent handed it (a temp dir) or sets an env var
   in its OWN process.

No code path here can reach the live home. :func:`apply_in_child` refuses outright when
``GIDEON_HOME`` still points at the default home — the negative rail, because a
misconfigured spawn is exactly how a "temporary" overlay becomes a permanent edit.

The arm vocabulary is closed (:data:`ARMS`) and validated on the way in: a typo'd arm
that silently toggled nothing would report a delta of 0.0, indistinguishable from a
component that does nothing — the exact conclusion the runner exists to draw.
