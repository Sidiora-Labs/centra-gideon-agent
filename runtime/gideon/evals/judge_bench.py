"""The judge benchmark harness → tier-recommendation table (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §6, ES-4).

Every gate in the flywheel and the engine rests on a judge verdict, and until now the
only calibration instrument was `loop/instrument.probe_judge`: one strong/null pair, on
whatever model happened to be bound, answering one bit ("blind or not"). This module
generalizes exactly that shape across the axes that actually cost money — **fixtures ×
judge tier × `judge_samples`** — and publishes the table that says which tier each rubric
class really needs.

── What it reuses rather than re-mints ──

The judge vocabulary is not re-derived here. `workflows.judge_contract` renders the
prompt (`judge_instruction`), parses the answer (`parse_judge_json`), validates it
(`validate_verdict`) and combines N samples (`aggregate_samples`) — the same four calls a
live judge gate makes, so a tier that passes this benchmark passes on the object the
engine will actually hand it. The separation floor is
`judge_calibration.CANARY_MIN_SEPARATION`, imported rather than restated, because a
second threshold would make one judge trustworthy to the benchmark and blind to the
canary. Agreement-with-known-verdict is `judge_calibration.DivergenceRecord.direction`,
which already names the three outcomes (`agreement` / `false_pass` / `false_reject`) —
a fixture's known verdict IS a human label, so a judge disagreeing with it IS a
divergence record, and reusing that function keeps the benchmark's agreement metric and
the product's live one the same arithmetic.

── The axes are CONSUMED, and that is the load-bearing property ──

A matrix axis nothing reads produces N identical runs wearing different labels — a
fabricated comparison that looks real in every artifact. So both axes are consumed at a
named seam and tested for it:

* `judge_samples` decides how many times :func:`observe_cell` calls the judge. The
  observation records `calls`, so "the axis moved" is a recorded number rather than a
  claim, and `test_judge_samples_axis_is_consumed` fails if the loop stops honouring it.
* `tier` decides the `use_case` (:func:`use_case_for_tier`, the engine's own
  `DEFAULT_MODEL_TIERS`) that resolves the model, and the observation records the model
  the call ran on.

── Why there is no child process here ──

`run_matrix`'s subprocess spawn exists to contain ONE hazard: `EvalRunner.run_scenario`
mutates `GIDEON_WORKSPACE` in the calling process (§1.3). A judge fixture is a
fixed block of text plus a rubric — nothing is executed, no workspace is written, and
`EvalRunner` is never constructed. So this consumer runs in-process, reusing the shared
`MatrixSpec`/:func:`~gideon.evals.matrix.expand_cells`/
:func:`~gideon.evals.matrix.aggregate` and the same `matrices/<id>/` artifact sinks.
Skipping the spawn is not skipping the rail; the rail guards a seam this path does not
touch.

── Honesty rules, mechanized rather than left to the reader ──

An unmeasured property is never adequate. A rubric class with no strong/null pair reports
`separation: None` and is INADEQUATE; a class never position-swapped reports
`flip_rate: None` and is INADEQUATE. Absent is not the same as satisfied, and a rail that
matched nothing must not read clean. A cell whose judge produced no parseable verdict is
`VERIFIER_ABSENT` with its protocol errors counted — never averaged in as a wrong answer,
because "the judge could not answer" and "the judge answered wrongly" send a reader to two
different places. Cost is `None` when nothing priced the call, never `0.0`, since a free-
looking unpriced model would win "cheapest adequate tier" outright.
