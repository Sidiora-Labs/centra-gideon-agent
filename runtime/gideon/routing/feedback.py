"""Routing feedback extraction — WF2 judge verdicts as a per-cell signal (MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY
§4.2, MRT-5).

:func:`gideon.routing.stats._score` already computes ``0.60·success_rate + 0.40·feedback`` and
already renormalizes onto ``success_rate`` when ``feedback_n`` is 0. This module supplies the
missing INPUT — the ``(feedback, feedback_n)`` pair per ``(use_case, query_class, ref)`` cell — and
deliberately does not re-derive the arithmetic or the fallback: a second renormalisation that
disagreed with ``_score``'s would be two answers to one question, which is the duplication the
ledger extraction (PP-4) exists to prevent.

── What is read ──

The WF2 Run Ledger: ``<home>/workflows/runs/<run_id>/events.jsonl``, the file
:class:`gideon.ledger.writer.LedgerWriter` mirrors every :data:`LEDGER_KINDS` record into.
The kind is :data:`gideon.ledger.kinds.JUDGE_VERDICT` (``"judge_verdict"``) — "something
assessed something" — and the field read off it is ``verdict``, the closed
:class:`gideon.workflows.judge_contract.Verdict` vocabulary reconciled by ``WF2LOO-16``.
Nothing else is consulted: no second store, no parallel signal.

── The attribution rule, and the measured gap it exists to state ──

A judge verdict is usable as routing feedback only if it can be attributed to a
``(use_case, query_class, ref)`` triple, so an event must carry all three ITSELF: ``use_case``,
``query_class``, and either ``ref`` or both ``provider`` and ``model``. Anything short of that is
DROPPED (counted in a debug census, never guessed at).

**Measured on `main` at 12469c65, and the reason this reads as a strict requirement rather than a
join:** no ledger event carries the triple today.

* ``judge_verdict`` from the workflow producer (``workflows/controller.py``, at the gate settle)
  carries ``instance_path``, ``node_id``, ``epoch``, ``template``, ``verdict``, ``status``,
  ``evidence`` — no model, no provider, no use case, no query class.
* ``judge_verdict`` from the loop producer (``loop/journal.py``) carries ``cycle`` plus
  ``JudgeVerdict.to_dict()`` — same three coordinates missing.
* ``step_completed`` DOES carry ``model``/``provider``, but joining a verdict to it on ``node_id``
  resolves to the JUDGE GATE'S OWN model (the controller stamps the gate node's id), not the model
  whose output was judged. Attributing a PASS to the model that issued it would make a lenient
  judge look like a strong worker, so that join is refused rather than taken.
* ``query_class`` is computed only in ``guardrails/model_call.py`` at call time and lands only in
  ``model_calls.jsonl``; there is no ``audit_id`` on a ledger event and no run/node coordinate on
  an attempt row, so there is no key on which the two records could be joined either. This is the
  same "no join key" finding ``routing/usage.py`` (MRT-3) recorded for spend, and the same answer:
  fold what is attributable, census what is not, state the gap.

So the signal is 0 with ``feedback_n: 0`` in practice until a producer stamps those three fields on
the event it already writes, at which point this reader picks them up with no change here. That is
exactly the shape MRT-5's EXT dependency declares SOFT: the router functions on
``model_calls.jsonl`` alone, and ``_score`` collapses onto ``success_rate``.

── The scale, and the two refusals ──

``_score`` consumes ``feedback`` on the same [0,1] scale as ``success_rate`` (see the fold's
"EMA of a [0,1] signal"). Only two members of the closed vocabulary are assessments OF THE JUDGED
OUTPUT, so only they map onto it:

* ``PASS`` → 1.0 — an independent judge accepted the output.
* ``REJECT`` → 0.0 — it did not.

Everything else is refused, and the two refusals are different:

* ``RETRY``/``REPLAN``/``ESCALATE``/``NEEDS_INPUT`` are CONTROL FLOW, not quality: ``RETRY`` names a
  transient hiccup and ``ESCALATE``/``NEEDS_INPUT`` name "a human must decide". Scoring a transient
  as 0.0 would penalize a model for a network blip.
* A verdict string outside the closed enum entirely is a PARSER GAP. It is dropped, not scored
  neutral and not scored bad: a 0.5 nobody chose is a fabricated number steering real routing, and
  a 0.0 punishes a model for this module failing to keep up with the vocabulary. Dropping keeps
  ``feedback_n`` an honest count and makes the gap visible in the census instead.

``cannot_judge`` is likewise dropped — a refusal that says why is still not an assessment.

Note that ``PASS``/``REJECT`` is NOT a restatement of ``success_rate``: that is ``passed`` on the
attempt row (did the call mechanically succeed), while this is whether an independent judge accepted
what the call produced. A model that answers fast and wrongly scores 1.0 on the first and 0.0 here.

``quality_score`` (0-5) is deliberately NOT used even though the loop dialect carries it, because
the workflow producer does not: preferring it where present would make two producers' feedback
numbers non-comparable inside one cell — a fifth dialect, in the shape the vocabulary
reconciliation exists to stop.

── What increments ``feedback_n`` ──

Exactly one thing: an attributable event carrying ``PASS`` or ``REJECT``, counted once per
``event_id``. Not an unattributable event, not a control-flow verdict, not an unknown verdict, not
``cannot_judge``, and not a re-read of an ``event_id`` already counted (``event_id`` is
deterministic — ``<run>-evt-<seq>`` — so a re-emit is idempotent here too). ``feedback_n``
feeds an ``n >= 5`` decision floor downstream, so an inflated count changes routing on nothing.

── Never raises, never writes ──

A missing home, a missing ledger, a corrupt line and a half-written final line all read as "no
signal". Nothing here opens a file for writing. A feedback-read failure must not break a routing
decision, for the same reason ``stats.py`` states about the fold: the model call is the product,
this is observability.
