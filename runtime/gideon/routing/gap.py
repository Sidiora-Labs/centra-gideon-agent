"""Routing gap detection — what turns measured evidence into a PROPOSAL (MRT-5 §6.3).

:mod:`gideon.routing.proposals` is a queue *primitive*: it is handed a ``current`` order, a
``proposed`` order and the evidence, and it enqueues. Nothing computed the gap, so nothing ever
called it — a queue with no executor, whose ``n >= min_samples`` clause had no ``n`` anywhere on the
proposal path. This module is that executor, and it is deliberately the ONLY caller of
:func:`proposals.propose` in the tree.

**Where it runs, and why there** — the trigger point §6.3 never names. Three candidates were on the
table: at route time inside ``route_refs``, on the stats-fold write, or a scheduled sweep. The fold
write wins on four counts:

* A proposal is a function of the EVIDENCE, not of a request. The fold write is the one moment new
  evidence arrives, so it is the only moment a gap can newly appear. A timer would re-derive the
  same answer on an interval that no plan section supplies, with a job owner that does not exist.
* The route path stays exactly as it is: no queue read, no proposal write, and no second walk of the
  run ledger on the path a model call waits on. Detecting at route time would add all three — and
  would additionally have to run the learned stage on the lever-3 path that currently short-circuits
  before it, i.e. new work on every call for every cell that already has a recorded order.
* ``proposals._notify``'s own docstring already assumed this call site ("reached from a fold, not a
  request", which is why it reaches the dashboard state through the process-wide accessor rather
  than a request object). The queue was written for this trigger.
* A proposal has to reach a user who never opens the Routing tab. That disqualifies the cheapest
  variant of all — sweeping when the proposals list is read — because its notification would only
  ever fire while the user was already looking at the surface it points to.

The fold write is documented best-effort observability that "must not break a model call", so this
runs inside its own ``try`` with its own log line: a detector failure stays attributable to the
detector, is never mistaken for a fold failure, and never reaches the call.

**What counts as a gap.** Exactly this: *the learned finding is not what routing will actually do.*
``current`` is what :func:`policy.route_refs` returns today — whichever lever wins, be it a recorded
order, the heuristic floor, or the learned stage itself — and ``proposed`` is the learned stage
applied on top of that. The two differ only when the fold's opinion is not already in effect, which
is precisely when there is something for a human to decide. Under ``learned`` mode with no recorded
order the stage is already live, the two agree, and nothing is proposed: the machine does not ask
permission for what it is already permitted to do. Under ``heuristic`` mode, or against a recorded
order that the evidence has since outgrown, a proposal is the ONLY route to the table — which is
what propose-don't-write means in practice.

**Why every floor here is borrowed rather than restated.** ``n >= min_samples`` is
``learned._opinion``'s floor and the score is ``stats._score``: this module calls both instead of
re-deriving either, so there is never a second answer to "does this ref have an opinion" or "what is
it worth". The quality floor is the same ``hysteresis`` band the ordering stage bands by — and a
within-band difference is deliberately NOT a gap, because cost is the only thing allowed to reorder
near-equals (§5.2). A cost preference is not a quality finding and must not nag a user about their
table.
