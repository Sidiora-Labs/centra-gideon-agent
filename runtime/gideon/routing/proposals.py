"""Routing proposals — the learned stage PROPOSES, a human decides (MRT-5 §6.3-6.4).

The learned scoring stage can measure that one of the user's own bindings beats another for a
kind of request. It must never act on that alone. ``routing_policy.json`` is the user's table:
the three levers in :mod:`gideon.routing.policy` (mode, pin, order) are theirs, and a
telemetry fold quietly rewriting lever 3 would mean the machine changed which provider sees the
user's content without anyone deciding to. So a quality gap does not write — it **enqueues a
proposal** here, with the evidence that justified it, and waits.

**Propose-don't-write is the whole design.** Nothing in this module's proposal path touches
``routing_policy.json``; ``tests/test_routing_proposals.py`` asserts the file is byte-identical
across a ``propose``. :func:`accept` is the only writer, and it is reached only from a human
decision. :func:`reject` writes no table at all — it records a suppression so the same finding
cannot re-nag.

**Shape borrowed from** :mod:`gideon.skills.proposals` (the other propose-only queue in
this tree): a bounded queue, a ``None`` return rather than an exception when the queue is full or
the inputs are empty, and untrusted text FENCED so a poisoned record can't direct a model that
later renders it. Nothing is imported from there — a skill proposal and a routing proposal share
a posture, not a schema.

**The store.** ``<home>/routing_proposals.json``, beside ``routing_policy.json`` and
``routing_stats.json`` — one small JSON file written with :func:`atomic_write`, the convention
every other routing store follows. It holds the queue AND the rejection ledger, because a
cooldown that lived in memory would reset on every gateway restart and therefore would not be a
cooldown. A missing or corrupt file reads as an empty queue and never raises: this module is
observability-grade like the rest of the routing package, and failing a model call because a
proposal store was unreadable would invert the priority.

**What "the same proposal" means for the cooldown** (``routing.reproposal_cooldown_days``):
``(use_case, query_class, the ref being promoted to first)``. Keying on the whole proposed order
would let a one-token reorder of the tail re-nag the moment it was rejected; keying on
``(use_case, query_class)`` alone would swallow a genuinely different finding — "try the OTHER
local model first" — for a fortnight. A rejection means "no, don't put *that* ref first for this
kind of request", so that is exactly what is suppressed.
