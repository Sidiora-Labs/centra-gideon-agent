"""Usage/spend read model — the durable per-day fold ``usage_stats.json`` (MRT-3).

The spend-framed lens over telemetry that is ALREADY recorded (zero new collection), riding §1.3's
fold discipline: ``~/.gideon/usage_stats.json`` (``atomic_write``), keyed
``date -> "provider:model" -> purpose`` of ``{calls, tokens_in, tokens_out, dollars_est, …}``.

**The fold reads ONE record and CENSUSES the other. Why (this is the atom's whole design
question, and the reason it was BLOCKED before — see the plan's MRT-3 execution log ①–⑥):**

Gideon records model cost in two places that cannot be safely summed:

* ``usage/turns.jsonl`` (``usage_ledger.py``) — one row per streamed TURN, five live writers, with
  real caller provenance in ``source``: ``chat`` | an app name | ``loop`` | ``cron`` | ``channel``
  | ``cli`` | ``subagent`` | ``background``. This covers interactive chat — the user's largest line
  item — so it is THE spend record and the only honest input for a "~$X this month" sentence.
* ``model_calls.jsonl`` (``guardrails/audit.py``) — one row per guarded ``ModelProvider.complete()``
  ATTEMPT. ``provider_bridge`` attaches the guard only for
  ``use_case in ("reasoning", "background", "loops", "orchestration")`` and states the exclusion as
  a design decision ("The interactive chat/code_tools stream stays OUT OF SCOPE … both
  human-watched"), so this record structurally cannot answer "what did this cost me".

A union of the two double-counts: a loop worker's turn is recorded as a ``source="loop"`` turn AND
its inner inference resolves under the ``loops`` axis into a guarded attempt row. Neither row
carries the other's identity — there is no ``audit_id`` on a turn and no session key on an attempt —
so there is NO join key with which to deduplicate. A cross-store total is therefore not merely
expensive to get right, it is currently *unavailable*, and a money surface that silently
double-counts is worse than one that admits a gap.

So: the fold sums the ledger, and :func:`audit_census` counts what is being left out
(``fold["uncounted"]``) so the surface can say "N unattended calls (~$X) are recorded but not
included here, because they cannot be merged without double-counting loops". That turns an
invisible gap into a stated one. Closing it properly means widening the attempt audit to cover
every axis and retiring one of the two records — a class-B change across five writers, out of this
atom's scope.

**Purpose is the unifying vocabulary.** The ledger's ``source`` maps into the fixed
``interactive | background | loop | eval | app`` vocabulary. A source that is none of the known
literals is an APP NAME (``chat_runner`` sets ``source = session._app or "chat"``), so it maps to
``app`` and the name is recorded in ``fold["app_sources"]`` — a census, not an error. An app name
that IS a known literal is that literal's purpose, not ``app``: the loop engine names its worker
session ``app="loop"``, which is why ``loop`` has a live writer. ``eval`` is declared for a first
writer and has none today; :func:`reachable_purposes` reports what the current
writers can actually produce so a UI never renders a permanent zero row.

**A row that cannot be attributed to a day is counted, never dropped** — ``fold["unmapped"]``
carries it, because a fold that discards rows produces a plausible number for every input.

**Two honesty disclosures, deliberately not merged:**

* ``estimated_share`` — the fraction of a figure's DOLLARS that is a rate-table estimate rather
  than a provider-reported charge. ``TurnUsage`` carries no "estimated" flag, so a ledger dollar is
  treated as an estimate CONSERVATIVELY (over-disclosing an estimate is safe; claiming absent
  precision is not) and the share reads 1.0 today. It is not decoration: the fold keeps per-cell
  ``estimated_dollars``, so it drops below 1.0 as soon as a writer marks a reported cost.
* ``unpriced_calls`` / ``priced`` — calls whose model has NO rate at all (``priced: false`` on the
  turn, or ``rates.rate_for`` → ``None``). Their dollars are structurally 0, so a total containing
  them is a FLOOR. An unpriced model must never read as "$0 spent". Locally-served refs are
  different and legitimate: they price 0.0 with ``source="local"`` and are counted in
  ``local_calls``.

Rebuild: :func:`rebuild` refolds from scratch — the §1.3 ``--rebuild`` discipline applied to this
fold (``routing.stats.rebuild`` is its sibling over the audit JSONL). Note that flag does not exist
yet: ``--rebuild-routing-stats`` appears in §1.3 and in ``stats.py``'s docstring but no ``cli.py``
argument implements it, so the rebuild is reached through :func:`refresh`, which every
``GET /api/usage`` calls — a deleted fold self-heals on the next read. :func:`refresh` merges the
refold OVER the persisted fold so days that have aged out of the capped JSONL survive (the ledger
trims at 2×50000): per cell it keeps whichever saw more ``calls``, which is correct because trimming
can only remove rows from a completed day, never add them. That is why a durable fold earns its
place beside the ledger's own ``group_by="day"`` rollup, which can only see the retained tail.
