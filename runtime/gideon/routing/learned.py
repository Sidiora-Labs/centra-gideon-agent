"""Learned ordering — the ``learned`` mode's scoring stage (MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY §4.2, MRT-5).

``policy.MODES`` has carried ``"learned"`` since MRT-4, but with no scoring stage behind it the
mode folded onto the heuristic floor (``policy.py`` docstring, and the comment at its ordering
site). This module is that stage: given the fold ``stats.py`` maintains, it reorders the candidate
refs for one ``(use_case, query_class)`` request.

Four semantics, each deliberate:

**A confidence floor, and what "no opinion" means.** A ref with fewer than ``min_samples``
recorded calls (config default 5) has no learned opinion, so it must be neither promoted NOR
demoted on that noise. It therefore keeps its incoming SLOT: the stage permutes only the refs that
do have an opinion, among the positions those refs already occupied, and every sub-threshold ref
stays exactly where the previous lever (the bound order, or the heuristic that ran before this
stage) put it. Demoting it instead would be a demotion on absent evidence, and promoting it would
let a single lucky call outrank a long measured record — the config prose for ``min_samples`` says
it plainly: below the floor "the simple local-first rule stands". With fewer than two opinions
there is nothing to compare, so the input is returned untouched.

**Hysteresis is a band, not a tie-break.** Two refs whose scores differ by less than
``hysteresis`` are *near-equal*: that difference is noise and must not reorder them, which is
exactly the flip-flopping the knob exists to prevent. So refs are grouped into bands, and inside a
band the incoming order stands — score differences are ignored there — with cost as the only thing
allowed to move a member. A band is anchored at its BEST score, so its width is exactly
``hysteresis``; grouping by "within hysteresis of the previous member" instead would chain
(0.90 → 0.86 → 0.82 …) and let a cheap, meaningfully worse ref overtake a better one, which is the
knob backwards — quality traded for pennies on every call.

**The cloud margin is asymmetric on purpose.** Local-first is the posture, so a cloud ref must
EARN its place: its score carries a ``cloud_quality_margin`` penalty, and a merely equal cloud ref
therefore loses to local. The penalty is applied before banding, so a cloud ref that beats local by
only a hair more than the margin lands in the same band as it and still does not jump — deliberately
conservative in the one direction of error that costs the user money and privacy.

**Degradation is a clause.** An empty, missing, partial or corrupt fold yields no opinions and the
refs come back unchanged, so the caller falls through to the heuristic — which is the permanent
below-confidence-floor floor, not a failure mode. Bad values are handled by the scoring path
itself; the ``except`` at the end is a fail-safe that logs when it fires, because a stage that
leans on someone else's ``except Exception`` is a stage whose failures are invisible.

The function is pure: no file, config, network or clock access — everything arrives as an argument,
including the cost lookup (injected, so a missing price cannot break a routing decision and the
rate table is not a dependency of an ordering decision).
