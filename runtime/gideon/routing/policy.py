"""Heuristic route ordering — ``route_refs`` + ``routing_policy.json`` (MRT-4, §3, §4.1, §6.1-6.2).

The router does not pick a model; it **reorders the user's own bindings**. Candidates for a routed
use case are exactly the refs ``active_models.json`` holds for it (§3.1) — this module never
invents, adds, or drops one. That is the whole contract, and it is what makes routing safe to
enable: the worst a bad ordering can do is try the user's second choice first.

**Pure reorder (the load-bearing invariant).** :func:`route_refs` returns a *permutation* of its
input: same refs, same count, same multiplicity, different order. It is built as a stable sort over
the input indices precisely so dropping a ref is not expressible, and it re-checks the invariant
before returning. A reorder that silently dropped a candidate would remove a provider the user
deliberately configured — the resolution chain would then skip straight past it, and the
"unresolvable pinned ref RAISES" rule (§3.1) would stop protecting them.

**Deterministic and total.** Every ordering is a stable sort keyed on an integer rank, so
equal-ranked refs keep their ``active_models.json`` order — the documented tie-break. The same
inputs therefore produce the same order in every process, with no dependence on dict iteration,
clock, or set ordering.

**Fail-open, always.** Every input this module reads (``routing_policy.json``, the per-use-case
settings store, the local-model registry, the provider registry's declared capabilities) is
observability-grade, not load-bearing. A missing or corrupt read degrades to the next-weaker
signal and, at worst, to the original order. A routing decision must never fail because a
telemetry read did: routing changes *order*, never *resolution semantics* (§3.1).

Ordering precedence, strongest first:

1. **mode ``off``** (the default) → identity. Routing is opt-in per use case.
2. **pin** (§6.2 lever 2) → ``local`` / ``cloud`` / an explicit ref is hoisted first and the
   heuristic is short-circuited. A user pin is mightier than any policy.
3. **an explicit table order** for this ``(use_case, query_class)`` → the stored order wins
   (its ``basis`` records whether a user or a learned proposal decided it, §6.1). Refs the
   table doesn't mention keep their original relative order *after* the listed ones, so a
   newly-bound ref is never lost.
4. **the heuristic** (§4.1) → local-first, with two class exceptions: ``extract_structured``
   prefers a candidate declaring structured output, and ``long_reasoning`` demotes a local model
   whose id exposes a parameter-size hint below :data:`_MIN_LOCAL_REASONING_B`.

Mode ``learned`` is accepted and folded onto the heuristic here: the learned scoring stage is
MRT-5's, and the heuristic is its permanent below-confidence-floor floor (§4.2), so a use case
already set to ``learned`` behaves as ``heuristic`` rather than erroring or silently going off.
