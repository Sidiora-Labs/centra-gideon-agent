"""The learning summary block — new / refined / pending counts + names (LV-3).

What this is: a bounded, read-only gather over the learning artifacts that ALREADY
have live writers, rendered as one small block. It answers "what has this thing
learned lately" in four groups:

* **new** — skills whose provenance ``created_at`` falls inside the window.
* **refined** — skills whose provenance ``refined_at`` falls inside the window, plus
  skills carrying a sidecar overlay refinement stamped inside it.
* **pending** — skill proposals still awaiting a human decision (unwindowed by
  design: a proposal from five weeks ago is *more* interesting, not less).
* **facts** — preference facets and lessons touched inside the window.

Where it renders: LV-3's task row wanted this registered with plan 42's digest
builder. **That builder does not exist** — there is no digest-section registry in
the tree — so the same block renders on the skills page header instead, which the
task row and the atom's ``done_when`` both name as the sanctioned fallback. When a
digest builder does arrive, it consumes THIS function; the block is not reimplemented
there. One owner, one mechanism.

Two deliberate properties:

* **Propose-don't-write.** Every read here is a snapshot. Nothing in this module
  writes to a skill, a proposal, a facet or a lesson — so opening the panel cannot
  change what it reports.
* **Counts are true, names are a sample.** ``count`` is the full group size;
  ``names`` is capped at :data:`_MAX_NAMES`. A UI that showed ``len(names)`` as the
  count would under-report as soon as a group got busy, so the two are separate
  fields and the count is never derived from the truncated list.

LEARNING-VISIBILITY's LV-4 identity report composes the long-horizon view over these
same seams; it reads this gather rather than re-deriving it.
