"""Workspace time-travel — local git history over the state a human edits (§5).

This is the "undo what just happened" half of durability, deliberately distinct
from the scheduled snapshots (§3), which are for disasters. The user edits a
skill, the agent rewrites a memory note, a config toggle turns out to be wrong —
none of that is a disaster, and none of it should require restoring a tarball.

Shape of the mechanism:

* **Roots.** A small set of state trees get their own git repository: the config
  document + entity settings, ``skills/``, the memory markdown workspace, the
  prompt surfaces, and per-project context. Each root's repo is a *separate git
  directory* under ``<home>/state-history/``, with the tracked tree as its work
  tree. No ``.git`` ever appears inside the user's home or workspace, so nothing
  else in Gideon (or the user's own tooling) trips over one.

* **Deny-by-default ignore.** Every root's ``info/exclude`` starts by excluding
  everything and then re-includes exactly the declared paths. That is what makes
  "secrets are gitignored" a structural property rather than a denylist someone
  has to keep current: a root whose work tree is the home directory cannot commit
  ``.local_secret`` or ``security/`` because it never re-includes them. A second,
  pattern-based layer catches secret-shaped files that could appear *inside* a
  tracked tree (a stray ``.env`` under ``skills/``).

* **Rollback vs revert.** ``rollback`` is a hard reset with the prior HEAD saved
  into a service-owned ref, so the commits you rolled away stay listable and
  forward travel is possible. ``revert`` is git's inverse commit, so
  non-overlapping later edits survive; an overlap fails loudly naming the
  blocking files instead of leaving a half-merged tree. Both take an optional
  ``paths`` subset — "restore just this note", not the whole tree — and the
  distinction survives the subset: a per-file rollback DISCARDS later edits to
  the named paths, a per-file revert KEEPS them.

* **Preview first.** Both operations have a ``preview_*`` sibling that returns
  the affected files and per-file diffs, and neither destructive call is reachable
  from the API without the user confirming that preview.

Time-travel history is **local only**. It never enters an export, a snapshot or a
sync transport: ``state-history`` is in the inventory's ignored set, which is the
one place that decides what travels.
