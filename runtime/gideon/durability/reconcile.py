"""Reconcile a peer's rows into the live store (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-d).

The bridge that turns "I pulled a peer's shards" into "the peer's rows are now in my live
store", composing the three pure pieces already built:

    local rows  ←  read the entry's on-disk form the same way the exporter extracts it
    merged      ←  merge.merge_rows(entry.merge, local, remote, tombstones=entry.tombstones)
    live store  →  writeback.apply_rows(entry.kind, dest, merged)

It is deliberately the ROW path only — the kinds whose merge is a deterministic row
reconciliation (`json_entity_dir`, `json_file`, `jsonl_append`). A `sqlite` entry is merged
by the ATTACH-OR-IGNORE path in ``snapshot.py`` and a `tree` entry is rehydrated from the
content-addressed blob store, so :func:`reconcile_entry` DECLINES those (returns a
``handled=False`` outcome) rather than raising — the cycle engine (the atom above this) reads
that verdict and routes the entry to its DB/blob path. A row-mergeable entry that raises
mid-reconcile is caught and reported as a `payload-bad` verdict so one poison entry can't
abort the whole pull; the caller advances its cursor past it (per §4.1) rather than looping.

Reads the local rows exactly as ``shards.export_shards`` would, so the merge sees the same
row shapes on both sides — the invariant that makes convergence hold (criterion 4).
