"""End-to-end encryption for sync shard objects (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.4, DAS-8).

The codec that makes *untrusted* storage a valid sync transport. It sits at exactly one
seam — the transport boundary — so every byte a transport ever sees is ciphertext, and
nothing above the boundary (merge, registry, cursor, outbox) knows encryption exists:

    push:  export_shards → _objects_for → **encrypt_objects** → transport.push
    pull:  transport.pull → **decrypt_objects** → _materialize → import_shards

**What stays plaintext, and why.** §4.4's rule is that *routing* metadata must be readable
without the key, so sync logic works on a machine that has not been given the passphrase and
so an operator can inspect a remote store. Three things are therefore never encrypted:

* the object **key** itself (``machines/<machine_id>/seq-NNNN/<rel>``) — the machine id, the
  seq and the shard's name are the routing plane; they are what ``list_remote`` sorts on,
* ``registry.json`` — the machine/seq/ancestor ledger the CAS loop compares shas on,
* the **salt object** — a public parameter by construction; a secret salt buys nothing.

Everything else — every shard byte, i.e. every row of the user's tasks, memory, knowledge —
is AES-256-GCM ciphertext before it leaves the process.

**Key schedule.** Two stages, because the two jobs are different:

1. **Stretch** the user passphrase into a 32-byte master key with **Argon2id** over the
   shared salt. §4.4 says "HKDF from a user passphrase"; HKDF alone is a *fast* KDF, so a
   passphrase run through it directly is an offline-brute-force gift to whoever holds the
   bucket — the exact adversary this feature exists for. The stretch is a strengthening of
   the plan's shape, not a departure from it: same inputs (passphrase + the first-write-wins
   salt), same machine-agnostic property, one ~50 ms cost per process (the master key is
   cached in the :class:`SyncCodec` and never persisted).
2. **Expand** per shard with **HKDF-Expand**, ``info`` = the object key. Per-object keys mean
   two shards never share a key, so the nonce-reuse blast radius is one object rather than
   the whole store, and a ciphertext lifted from one key and dropped at another decrypts
   under neither.

**Nonce.** 12 random bytes per encryption from ``os.urandom``, carried in the header. Never a
counter: a counter that restarts (a new process, a re-export, a restored home) reuses a nonce
under the same key, which is the one mistake AES-GCM does not survive.

**AAD.** The header (magic + version + nonce) *and* the object key are authenticated. Binding
the key means an attacker with write access to the bucket cannot replay machine A's
``tasks`` shard as machine B's, or an old seq's as a new one: the tag fails.

**Plaintext in an encrypted store is a permanent skip, both directions** (§4.4). On receive, a
non-ciphertext object is dropped with a log and never retried — the seq it belonged to fails
validation and lands as ``payload-bad``, which the cursor advances past (§4.1's rule), so a
contract violation can never become an error loop. On send, the encrypt pass re-checks its own
output and refuses to hand a transport any non-routing plaintext object.

**Key custody, and what a lost passphrase costs.** The passphrase lives in the credential
store under one name (:data:`PASSPHRASE_CREDENTIAL`) — never ``config.json``, never an
``app.json``, never a provider settings field, so it is never in an API response, a SEL
record or an export. The *derived* keys live in a :class:`SyncCodec` for the life of a cycle
and are never written anywhere. Losing the passphrase does **not** lose the user's data: the
local home is authoritative and untouched: what is lost is the ability to read the *remote*
copies, and the recovery is a fresh sync root. There is deliberately **no key rotation
mechanism** — rotating would mean re-encrypting every historical object under a new salt, and
that is a plan-level design decision, not something to improvise here.
