"""The transport-driven pull half of the sync cycle (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-e).

This is where the pure pieces meet a real remote. Given a transport (DAS-6a), the local
:class:`registry.Registry` just pulled, and the durable :class:`cursor.Cursor`, it walks the
peers' unseen shard sets and merges each into the live store:

    for each peer prefix the cursor hasn't consumed (registry.new_prefixes_since, ascending):
        refs   = transport.list_remote(prefix)          # cheap
        objs   = transport.pull(refs)                   # bytes
        dir    = materialize objs (strip the prefix)    # a validatable shard dir
        rows   = shards.import_shards(dir)              # 6b — validates, reassembles
        for each entry: reconcile.reconcile_entry(...)  # 6c-i + 6c-ii-c + 6c-ii-d
        cursor.record(peer, seq, aggregate_verdict)     # 6c-ii-b — consumed-only

The **DB path is an injected seam**, not skipped. A `sqlite`/`tree` entry can't be losslessly
rebuilt from row shards (the exporter stores embedding/blob columns as size placeholders), so
those go to an optional ``db_merger`` callback. Until it's provided (DAS-6c-ii-f), a seq that
contains a DB entry is **held** — the cursor is not advanced, so the seq is re-pulled once the
seam lands, rather than silently skipping unmerged database data (§4.1: advance only on
consumed rows). That is the honest partial-slice behavior, and it keeps the row-entry
convergence path (criterion 4) fully working today.

Aggregate verdict for a seq: any held entry (prerequisite-absent, or a DB entry with no
merger) holds the whole seq; otherwise ``payload-bad`` if any entry was poison (advance past
it), else ``consumed``. A prefix the remote can't actually serve yet (a partial push) holds.
