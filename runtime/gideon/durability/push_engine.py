"""The transport-driven push half of the sync cycle (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-f).

The mirror of the pull engine. Given a fresh local shard export (from ``shards.export_shards``),
it publishes that export as this machine's next seq and announces it in the shared registry:

    seq       = registry.bump(self_id, manifest_sha=…, now=…)   # 6c-ii-a — monotonic
    objects   = every file in the export dir, keyed machines/<self_id>/seq-NNNN/<rel>
    outbox.enqueue(target, seq, …)                              # 6c-ii-b — durable obligation
    drain: transport.push(objects) → outbox.record_outcome(...) # never-drop outcomes
    CAS:   transport.cas_registry(expected_sha, registry.to_bytes())
             on a lost race → re-pull the registry, re-bump on top, retry (idempotent)

Every step composes a piece already shipped and tested in isolation; this module owns only the
orchestration and the CAS-retry loop. Insert-only object keys (seq-numbered, never rewritten)
make a retried push a no-op, so a CAS race costs a re-pull, never a double-write or a lost push.

Clock-free: the timestamp is passed in (``now``), like the registry and outbox models.
