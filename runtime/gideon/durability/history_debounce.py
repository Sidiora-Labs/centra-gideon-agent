"""Adaptive-debounce committer for time-travel history (§5).

Every successful atomic write announces itself through
:func:`gideon.atomic_write.register_post_write_hook`. Committing on each
announcement would put a git process in the write path of every JSON store, so
writes are coalesced instead:

* a write schedules a commit **10 seconds** out;
* sustained writing tightens that toward **0** — a burst of edits commits almost
  immediately once it is clear the user (or the agent) is mid-flow, so the
  history stays useful rather than lagging a fixed ten seconds behind reality;
* work is **serialized per root**: a root already committing does not get a
  second concurrent git process, the pending mark is simply left armed for the
  next pass.

The scheduler owns no time of its own. It takes a clock and is driven by
:meth:`HistoryDebouncer.run_pending`, which a one-line background thread calls on
a short cadence in production and a test calls with a fake clock. That is
deliberate: a debouncer that could only be observed by sleeping could only be
tested by measuring a skeleton.
