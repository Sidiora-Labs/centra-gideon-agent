"""The scheduled snapshot service (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §3).

Durability today is manual and single-shot: you run `gideon snapshot` when you
remember to. This project has already lost a memory directory once (2026-07-02), and
"when you remember to" is exactly the property that failed.

So the schedule is boring and automatic:

* a **nightly full snapshot** (the existing tar path) with tiered retention, so a
  year of history costs ~30 files instead of 365;
* an **hourly incremental shard export** of only what changed, which bounds the blast
  radius of any loss to one hour;
* a **monthly restore drill** — because a backup nobody has restored is a hope, not a
  backup. The drill restores into a temp directory, validates the shards, runs
  `PRAGMA integrity_check` on every SQLite copy, and reports PASS/FAIL. It never
  touches live state.

Everything here is defensive on purpose. A snapshot service that can crash a gateway,
block a request, or double-run concurrently is worse than no service, so every job is
budgeted, single-flighted across processes, and swallows its own failures into an
audited report.
