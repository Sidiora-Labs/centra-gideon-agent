"""The state inventory — one manifest of everything that matters (§1).

Every durability mechanism (snapshot, export, and later shard/sync/drills) reads
THIS instead of carrying its own allowlist. That is the whole point: the previous
design had `snapshot.CORE_FILES` and `portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE` maintained by
hand, and they had already drifted — nine real store directories were covered by
neither. A declarative manifest plus :func:`audit_home` (which fails on any
unclaimed path) makes that class of bug impossible to reintroduce silently.

Each entry declares four things that matter to a backup:

* **kind** — how to read/write it safely. ``sqlite`` in particular must never be
  raw-copied while the gateway holds it open; see :func:`sqlite_entries`.
* **domain** — the user-facing grouping. Snapshot components are exactly the
  domains, so ``VALID_COMPONENTS`` is derived, never typed twice.
* **secret** — never leaves this machine, in any export or sync.
* **derived** — an index/cache rebuilt from authoritative state. Excluded from
  shards and exports; restoring it is at best wasted bytes and at worst a
  corrupt index paired with a newer store.

``merge`` and ``tombstones`` are declared here but consumed by later sessions
(restore --mode merge, shard sync); they are part of the entry's identity, so
they belong in the manifest rather than being bolted on later.
