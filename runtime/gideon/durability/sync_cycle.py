"""One full sync cycle: pull → merge → export → push (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-i).

The orchestrator that assembles every piece built in 6c-i … 6c-ii-h into the loop §4.1 names —
``pull → merge-import remote rows → export local union → push`` — against a resolved transport:

    registry = read the shared registry.json from the remote     (transport.pull of REGISTRY_KEY)
    pull_from_peers(transport, home, registry, cursor,            # 6c-ii-e + the 6c-ii-h db_merger
                    db_merger=make_db_merger(home))
    export_shards(home, out, include_databases=True)              # 6b + 6c-ii-g (DB copies)
    publish_export(transport, out, registry, outbox, …)           # 6c-ii-f (+ CAS registry bump)

Everything below the orchestration was already unit-tested in isolation; this module owns only
the wiring and the read-the-registry step. It is clock-free (``now`` is passed in) and does not
own scheduling — the ``stale_after_secs`` staleness window and the "is sync enabled / which
transport" resolution live in the service layer (6c-ii-j) that calls this. A transport error at
any step is caught and reported in the :class:`SyncCycleReport`, never raised, so one bad cycle
never kills the durability service loop.
