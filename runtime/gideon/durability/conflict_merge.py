"""The propose-only conflict merge pass (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.2 item 2 + §7, DAS-7).

A background LLM pass over the review queue: for each unresolved conflict it drafts a
merged version plus a rationale and writes them ONTO THE RECORD as a proposal. It never
touches the live store — the soul rule is *propose, don't write* (§7: no auto-applied LLM
merges), so the local version stays authoritative until a human accepts on the review
surface (DAS-10).

Two invariants, both tested:

* **Never auto-apply.** This module imports nothing that can write an entry's store — no
  ``writeback``, no ``reconcile``, no ``apply_rows``. A source-level rail in
  ``tests/test_durability_conflicts.py`` asserts that the dangerous direction is
  unreachable rather than merely unused, so a later edit can't quietly wire it up.
* **Fail-open on the model.** No model configured, an open circuit breaker, a timeout, a
  budget refusal, a schema miss, an unparseable answer — every one of them leaves the
  conflict record exactly where it was: ``needs-review``, with no proposal and a recorded
  ``proposal_error``. A missing model must never lose a conflict and must never silently
  resolve one. Nothing here raises; the report carries the failure count.

``use_case="background"`` is deliberate — the reasoning axis, never the chat/native-runtime
axis (a one-shot merge draft wants a plain model provider, not an agent runtime).
