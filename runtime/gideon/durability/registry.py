"""The versioned sync registry — ``registry.json`` (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-a).

One small shared object at the sync root records, per machine, the high-water mark of
what that machine has published::

    {"machines": {"<machine_id>": {"seq": 7, "last_export_at": "…", "manifest_sha": "…"}}}

It is the coordination point the whole sync cycle turns on, and it is deliberately the
ONLY mutable shared object: every shard lives at an insert-only, seq-numbered key
(``machines/<id>/seq-NNNN/…``) that is never rewritten, so the registry is what a machine
compare-and-swaps to announce "I published seq N" and what every other machine reads to
learn "which peers advanced, and to what seq — so which shard prefixes are new to me".

This module is the PURE registry MODEL — parse, serialize (canonically, so the sha a CAS
compares is stable), bump the local machine's seq on a fresh export, compute a peer's new
shard prefixes, and diff two registries to see who moved. It performs NO I/O and knows
nothing of a transport: the CAS write itself is
:meth:`sync_transports.base.SyncTransportProvider.cas_registry`, and the retry loop that
composes this model with that transport is DAS-6c-ii-b. Keeping the model I/O-free is what
makes the CAS contract testable without a remote and keeps a lost-race retry free — the
same inputs always canonicalize to the same bytes and the same sha.
