"""Task modes — the per-session posture that gates *which* tools may run.

A task mode is orthogonal to the approval mode: task mode decides whether a tool
is *allowed at all*; approval decides whether an allowed tool *auto-approves*. The
four modes:

  - ``agent``: full execution — no restriction.
  - ``ask``:   read-only Q&A — reads/search/recall run; every mutation is blocked.
  - ``plan``:  produce a plan — read-only inspection runs (so the plan is grounded
               in real state), but no mutation/execution.
  - ``build``: scoped to producing an artifact/widget/skill — read-only tools plus
               artifact-producing tools; other mutations blocked.

This module is the SINGLE source of truth for the gate. It is enforced in the
native runtime (``_guard_and_invoke``, before approval is consulted, so a
Trust/YOLO auto-approve can never bypass a task-mode restriction) AND in the
dashboard's permission handler (belt-and-suspenders for ACP runtimes that gate
via their own protocol path). It has no dashboard/agent dependencies so both
layers import it without a cycle.

# ``tool_call_update`` (see ``acp.translate.extract_tool_update_events``), so the host
# routinely holds a ``kind: "execute"`` frame with no command. Before this existed, that
# state resolved to the literal ``"destructive"`` — a verdict about the command, minted
# from the command's ABSENCE, which is how a read-only ``pwd; ls`` was audited as
# destructive (`G10`/`O10`). Absence now has its own value, and each consumer decides
# what to do with it explicitly: the gate DENIES it (fails closed — an unreadable
# command must not run under a read-only posture) while the label floors it at CAUTION
# (fails honest — never ``safe``, so it still raises a card, and never ``destructive``,
