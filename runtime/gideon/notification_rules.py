"""Per-(source, kind) notification rules (INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION C2/C3).

Before this, notification policy was one global switch: mute-all, a minimum severity, and
quiet hours. Every emitter was treated identically, so "stop telling me about heartbeats
but always interrupt me when a loop needs input" was inexpressible — the only way to
quieten one noisy kind was to raise the floor for everything.

This module adds the second axis. Each ``(source, kind)`` from
:mod:`gideon.notification_kinds` gets a rule:

* **mode** — ``never`` (drop), ``badge`` (persist, no toast), ``immediate`` (today's
  behavior), ``digest`` (batch for the scheduled summary).
* **targets** — where an ``immediate`` goes: ``dashboard`` today, ``channel_dm`` when a
  channel is configured, ``push``/``native`` reserved for the mobile and desktop plans.
* **conditions** — keywords / name-mention that ESCALATE a quieter mode to ``immediate``.

**The global gate still runs first, unchanged.** ``notification_allowed()`` in
`providers/entity_routes.py` remains the outermost check: mute-all means mute, whatever a
rule says. Rules refine *delivery* for notifications that already passed the gate; they
never resurrect a suppressed one. Keeping that order means the existing settings keep
their meaning and this file cannot become a way to bypass them.

**Conditions generalize the inbox's own alert fields.** The keyword and name-mention
semantics are lifted verbatim from ``inbox.evaluate_alert`` — case-insensitive substring
for keywords, whole-word matching on name parts of 3+ characters — so the behavior users
already configured survives the move to rules (S3 backfills those fields into conditions).

**Every failure path is fail-OPEN.** A missing file, malformed JSON, a bad mode, a corrupt
rule: all fall back to the registry default, which is ``immediate``. This mirrors the
existing gate ("a broken settings file must not silence the system") and is the
deliberate choice for an attention system — a notification shown when it could have been
batched is a small annoyance, while one silently dropped can lose a loop that needed an
answer. The one exception is ``mode: never``, which is only ever honored when it was read
cleanly from a well-formed rule.
