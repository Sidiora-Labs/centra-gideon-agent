"""Per-(source, kind) notification rules (INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION C2/C3).

Before this, notification policy was one global switch: mute-all, a minimum severity, and
quiet hours. Every emitter was treated identically, so "stop telling me about heartbeats
but always interrupt me when a loop needs input" was inexpressible — the only way to
quieten one noisy kind was to raise the floor for everything.

This module adds the second axis. Each ``(source, kind)`` from
:mod:`gideon.notification_kinds` gets a rule:

* **mode** — ``never`` (drop), ``badge`` (persist, no toast), ``immediate`` (today's
  behavior), ``digest`` (batch for the scheduled summary).
* **targets** — where an ``immediate`` goes: ``dashboard`` today, ``channel_dm`` when a
  channel is configured, ``native`` as a real OS notification whenever the desktop shell is
  connected (DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES DC-5 — see :func:`native_delivery`), ``push`` for a
  content-free phone ping (:mod:`gideon.push`, live since MOBILE-COMPANION ``MC-5``).
* **conditions** — keywords / name-mention that ESCALATE a quieter mode to ``immediate``.

**The global gate still runs first, unchanged.** ``notification_allowed()`` in
`providers/entity_routes.py` remains the outermost check: mute-all means mute, whatever a
rule says. Rules refine *delivery* for notifications that already passed the gate; they
never resurrect a suppressed one. Keeping that order means the existing settings keep
their meaning and this file cannot become a way to bypass them.

**Conditions generalize the inbox's own alert fields.** The keyword and name-mention
semantics are lifted verbatim from ``inbox.evaluate_alert`` — case-insensitive substring
for keywords, whole-word matching on name parts of 3+ characters — so the behavior users
already configured survives the move to rules (S3 backfills those fields into conditions).

**Every failure path is fail-OPEN.** A missing file, malformed JSON, a bad mode, a corrupt
rule: all fall back to the registry default, which is ``immediate``. This mirrors the
existing gate ("a broken settings file must not silence the system") and is the
deliberate choice for an attention system — a notification shown when it could have been
batched is a small annoyance, while one silently dropped can lose a loop that needed an
answer. The one exception is ``mode: never``, which is only ever honored when it was read
cleanly from a well-formed rule.

    This is the whole ``native`` target decision, in one pure function so the rule half is
    testable without a gateway and the Electron half without a rule. It answers three
    questions in order, and each ``None``/``False`` answer is a distinct product outcome:

    * **The rule does not name ``native``** → ``None``. No key on the note, so nothing
      downstream can raise one. This is the vacuity property the target rests on: a rule
      that did not ask for the desktop cannot get it, however the shell is configured.
    * **The rule names it but no shell can deliver it** → ``{"deliver": False, "reason": …}``.
      The dashboard delivery that runs anyway IS the fallback — the caller does not choose
      a different path, it just does not raise an OS notification. The reason rides along
      because "I asked for native and got a bell instead" needs an answer, and a UI that
      cannot say why reads as a broken toggle.
    * **The rule names it and the shell reports the capability available** →
      ``{"deliver": True, "reason": ""}``.

    *capability* is ``DesktopRegistry.capability("native_notifications")`` — ``None`` when
    no shell is registered at all. ``available`` is the only field consulted: the registry
    normalizes ``granted``/``requestable`` into it and fails closed, and macOS never
    reports notification authorization, so a ``granted`` check here would mean refusing to
    deliver on the one platform that cannot answer.

    Note what this does NOT do: it never promotes ``dashboard`` off the note and never runs
    for ``never``/``badge``/``digest``. ``native`` is an interruption, and the three quieter
