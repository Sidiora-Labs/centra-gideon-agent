"""Native inbox source — the always-on, push-based agent→inbox sink (seam S4).

Unlike the poll-based providers (filesystem, slack), the native source is a
**push** sink: an agent calls :func:`post_to_inbox` and the item is written
straight into the shared :class:`~gideon.inbox.InboxStore` (the same
``inbox.json`` every other source feeds) and broadcast live over the dashboard
WS. It is **always available** — independent of ``cfg.inbox.enabled`` and any
external provider — so the Inbox is useful out-of-the-box: any agent (chat,
goal loop, scheduled run, space member) can surface "I finished X", "I need a
decision on Y", "heads up about Z" with no Slack/email connected.

S4 pattern (shared, not a common base class): a native-always-on provider +
external pluggable providers + per-item ``source`` attribution + per-provider
health. This module owns the native half.
