@dataclass
class IncomingMessage:
    """One message a source polled, on its way to becoming an inbox row.

    ``kind`` is the source's own statement about WHAT this message is, and it is the only
    way ``mention``/``email`` rows can ever exist: the inbox's kind filter is a live
    reader, but before this field no source could write anything but the default, so the
    Mentions and Email filters could not match a single item by construction.

    Only a source knows its kind, and only from its own payload — a mail source knows it
    polled a mailbox; a channel source knows the vendor payload listed the operator among
    the message's at-mention ids. Core deliberately does NOT infer either one (scanning
    text for the user's name is an alerting heuristic, not an identity), so a source that
    does not set this stays a plain ``message``.

    Valid values are the channel-shaped kinds — ``message`` / ``mention`` / ``email``
    (``gideon.inbox.SOURCE_DECLARABLE_KINDS``). Anything else is refused at
    ingestion: the row still arrives, filed as ``message``, and the service logs a warning
    naming the source and the value it tried to claim.
