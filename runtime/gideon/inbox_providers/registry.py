"""The app-contributed message-source registry (INU-8).

Mirrors ``trigger_sources/registry.py`` and ``sync_transports/registry.py``: the
``inbox`` provider-type handler (``providers/registry.py::InboxTypeHandler``)
registers an installed app's source here on enable and removes it on disable.
:func:`gideon.inbox_providers.get_default_provider` reads it first, so an
app-declared source resolves the way every other app provider type resolves.

**This registry holds INSTANCES, not classes** — the one shape difference from
the ``gideon.message_source_providers`` entry-point group
(``get_message_providers() -> dict[str, type]``, instantiated as ``cls()``). A
manifest factory has ALREADY run by the time the handler sees its result, and it
may close over the app's own config/credentials, so re-instantiating it is not
possible. Keeping the two registries separate is deliberate: normalising an
instance into a fake "class" via a lambda would make ``dict[str, type]`` a lie
and push the shape confusion into every future reader of either path.

Keyed by the provider's own ``source_name`` (not the app name), because that is
what an inbox item records (``inbox.py``'s ``source`` field) and what a caller
asks :func:`get_default_provider` for. This module deliberately imports nothing
from ``providers/`` — the dependency runs one way, handler → registry.
