"""The Linux desktop driver: declared, resolvable, and honestly refusing (`DCU-6`, §3.6).

The peer of :mod:`~gideon.computer_use.windows_driver`, and its docstring carries the
reasoning for both — why the mapping had to become true, why the seven handlers are written out
instead of generated, and why nothing here may import an OS library at module level. Only the
two platform facts below differ.

Linux has one wrinkle Windows does not, recorded so nobody reads this module as a smaller job
than it is: AT-SPI is only present when an accessibility bus is actually running, so a real
driver here refuses along *two* axes — this one (no implementation) and, once implemented, "the
session exposes no a11y bus", which is an operator-fixable condition and therefore a different
code from this one. Wayland narrows it further: an AT-SPI client can read a tree that a
compositor will still not let it synthesise input into. None of that is decided here; it is
noted because the refusal below must not be mistaken for the whole Linux story.
