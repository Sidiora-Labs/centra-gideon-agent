"""The live-view renderer — one read-only view model for the dashboard (`DCU-7`, §3.7).

**Everything here is a MIRROR of something that already happened.** The plan's live view
"mirrors what the model already read", and this package reads accessibility trees, not
pixels (`DCU-3`) — so the honest mirror is the walked tree: the elements and frames of the
snapshots the dispatch is already holding for the model's own indices
(:func:`gideon.computer_use.service.live_snapshots`), the overlay's trail of approved
acting targets (:func:`gideon.computer_use.overlay.motion_trail`), and the SEL rows
every attempt already writes (`DCU-2`). :func:`live_view` therefore CANNOT show the human a
window the agent has not read: it takes no app argument, walks nothing, and calls no driver
— ``tests/test_computer_use_live_view.py`` asserts the absence by AST and by making the
driver seam explode under it.

**Why this module never consults the keystone as a gate.** ``enable_state.is_enabled()`` is
read here as a FACT to display ("armed" / "off"), never as a screen: the view renders on a
disarmed machine precisely because the most useful sentence it can say there is that the
machine is disarmed. Gating the view on the keystone would also make it a second keystone
reader in the decision sense — the drift ``require_enabled``'s docstring warns about. The
functions here are deliberately not named ``computer_*``: that prefix marks "this can
dispatch" (the keystone ratchet binds it to ``require_enabled``), and a view cannot.

**Narrower than the model saw, never wider.** Element ``value`` text is dropped outright —
a wireframe needs geometry, roles and titles, not field contents — and every string that
survives passes through :func:`gideon.security.redact_credentials`, the same one
definition of credential-shaped text the dispatch's step 7 applies before a result reaches
the model. So the view's ceiling is the model's floor: nothing reaches a browser that the
dispatch would not have handed the model.
