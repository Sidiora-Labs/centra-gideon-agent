"""The ceilinged child process the platform driver runs inside (`DCU-4`, §3.5).

**Why a subprocess at all**, when `DCU-3`'s macOS driver is a ctypes FFI that would happily
import in-process: §3.5 requires the driver to run as a ceilinged spawn so *"a wedged/looping
driver is bounded by the kernel, not just a userspace timeout"*. An accessibility call into an
unresponsive application can block for a long time inside the OS, and a blocked FFI call inside
the gateway is a blocked gateway. So the driver lives here, behind
``sandbox.create_subprocess_limited``, and the dispatch talks to it over one JSON request on
stdin and one JSON response on stdout.

**This process holds NO authority.** It never reads the keystone, never consults the allowlist,
and never screens an input target. By the time an operation reaches this module the dispatch has
already decided, audited, and committed; a second copy of any of those checks here would be a
second home for one policy, and this is the process an operator's own driver code will one day
run inside. Its only job is to turn one operation into one OS call and report honestly.
``tests/test_computer_use_dispatch.py::test_the_driver_child_makes_no_policy_decision`` asserts
that by AST.

**Today every operation refuses, and the refusal is real rather than simulated.** No platform
driver module exists yet — `DCU-3` owns the macOS one, `DCU-6` the Windows/Linux refusals — so
:func:`resolve_driver` finds nothing importable and this module answers with a typed
``ERR_COMPUTER_USE_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE`` naming the platform. §3 floor 6 is explicit about the
alternative being unacceptable: an unsupported platform reports a typed refusal, *"never a
silent no-op or a simulated success"*. The value of shipping the harness now is that the
ceilinged spawn is a live, exercised path today — the dispatch really starts this child, really
reads its answer, and really turns it into a refusal a model can read — so when `DCU-3` lands,
what changes is one importable module, not the containment story.
