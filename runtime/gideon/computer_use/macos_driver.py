"""The macOS accessibility driver's operation layer (`DCU-3`, §3.2).

:mod:`~gideon.computer_use.driver_host` finds this module by importing
``gideon.computer_use.macos_driver`` and calling ``op_<name>`` — that resolution IS the
call site this atom lands, and until now it returned ``None`` and every desktop tool answered
``ERR_COMPUTER_USE_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE``. Nothing else about the containment story changes: the
dispatch chain, the ceilinged spawn and the SEL audit were all live before this module existed.

**This process holds no authority** and re-states no policy — ``driver_host``'s docstring is the
contract and ``test_the_driver_child_makes_no_policy_decision`` asserts it. What this module does
own is the one check only the *acting* process can make honestly: the tree is re-walked here, at
the moment of the act, and the fingerprint the dispatch computed at screening time is compared
again. The dispatch's own re-walk (``service._require_fresh_element``) happens before the secure
field screen and the SEL row, so between it and the act there is a window in which the operator
can drag the window or a dialog can appear. Re-checking here closes it. The two checks are not a
duplicated policy — the dispatch decides *whether to try*, this decides *whether the tree it is
about to touch is still the one that was approved*.

**No ctypes here.** Every OS call goes through :mod:`~gideon.computer_use.macos_ffi`, so
the entire OS-input surface of this feature is one module an operator can read end to end, and a
test can substitute a recording double for it to prove which calls a given op makes — which is
how "the pointer does not move" becomes an assertion instead of a claim.
