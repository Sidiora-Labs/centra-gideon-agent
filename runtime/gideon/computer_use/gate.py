"""The SEL audit step for desktop computer use (DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §3 floor 5, `DCU-2`).

**This module has no opinion.** The plan places it as step 5 of the dispatch chain —
``gate.require_computer_use`` — and is emphatic about what that step is: *"SEL audit
(records, does not decide)"* and *"Every action is SEL-audited (``gate.require_computer_use``
records, doesn't decide)"*. The decisions happened already, upstream: the keystone
(:func:`gideon.computer_use.enable_state.is_enabled`, step 1) and the target policy
(``policy.check_app`` / ``policy.check_input_target``, steps 2 and 4). By the time control
reaches here the verdict exists; the only remaining obligation is that it is *written down*.

**The name is the plan's, and the veto is deliberately absent.** ``require_*`` reads like a
gate everywhere else in this codebase, and that is exactly the trap: the next reader will
want to add an ``if not allowed: raise`` here, because the name invites it. Do not. The
refusal a caller needs is :func:`enable_state.disabled_error` (or the policy's), raised by
the layer that made the call; duplicating it here would give one attempt two refusal sites
that can drift, and would make the audit step able to block an operation the policy allowed.
The signature returns ``None`` and the body raises nothing, on any input.

**Why "never decides" implies "never fails".** An audit step that can raise is a
decision-maker by accident: a full disk, a read-only home or a corrupt HMAC key file would
turn "record this" into "refuse this", and a capability the operator armed would collapse for
a reason that has nothing to do with safety. So every failure path here is swallowed —
:func:`require_computer_use` fails **open**.

**Why a swallowed failure is still loud.** A silently total swallow is indistinguishable from
a module that never ran, which would make the atom's clause ("every attempt, allowed or
refused, produces a SEL record") unfalsifiable in production. So a dropped record emits
``logger.warning`` naming the tool and the outcome that did NOT reach the log. WARNING is a
deliberate step up from :func:`enable_state.ensure_computer_use_boot`'s ``logger.debug``:
that record is once-per-run posture evidence, whereas this one is per-attempt, so a
systematically broken audit here is a *silent, ongoing* hole in the security record and must
be visible at the level an operator actually runs.

**What goes in the record, and why ``metadata`` carries no free text.**
:func:`gideon.sel.redact_event` exists because *"the log stores a truncated summary of
real tool arguments, so a record can carry a secret a user pasted into a command"* — but two
properties of it matter here. First, it runs only on the way **out** (the forward callback and
the audit read surface); :meth:`SecurityEventLog.log` writes ``asdict(event)`` to disk
unredacted, so anything placed in a field is on disk in the clear regardless. Second, it
delegates to :func:`gideon.security.redact`, which recognises *credential*-shaped
strings — not personal data. A computer-use attempt's natural payload is the worst possible
fit for both: a window title ("Bank of America — Checking"), a field label, or the text about
to be typed is personal data that is not credential-shaped, so it would pass ``redact_event``
untouched and sit in the audit log forever. Hence :data:`_safe_metadata`: string and container
values are replaced by a type+length shape summary, so a caller cannot leak user text into the
audit log through this module even by mistake. Keys survive (they are developer-authored
literals) and so do plain scalars, which is all the audit signal an attempt needs — *which*
tool, on *which* app, with *what* verdict. The two fields that do carry prose, ``resources``
and ``error``, take the target app and the refusal's stable code/reason (never tool
arguments), truncated at :data:`gideon.sel._MAX_ARG_LEN` like every other SEL writer.

#: The SEL ``event_type`` every computer-use attempt carries. One spelling, deliberately.
#:
#: The domain nouns already in the log (``channel_trust``, ``capability_grant``,
#: ``companion_discovery``, ``app_messaging``) are the convention this follows; ``api_access``
#: would be a lie, since driving a desktop accesses no API. It is NOT a second spelling of
#: `DCU-1`'s boot row: that row is ``api_access`` only because it uses the
#: :meth:`SecurityEventLog.log_api_access` convenience method, and it records a different
#: event class — the once-per-run keystone posture, not an attempt. The two stay findable
#: together because both are computer-use rows on one subsystem ``source``.
SEL_EVENT_TYPE = "computer_use"

#: The SEL ``tool_kind`` category for every row this module writes.
#:
#: The plan's prose (§3 tool surface) says each tool "emits a distinct SEL ``tool_kind``",
#: but :class:`gideon.sel.SecurityEvent` documents ``tool_kind`` as a *category*
#: ("execute_bash, fs_write, mcp") and ``operation`` as the "tool name". The field
#: definitions win: the per-tool distinctness the plan wants lives in ``operation``, and
#: ``tool_kind`` is the one value that selects the whole capability in a single field filter.
SEL_TOOL_KIND = "computer_use"

#: The SEL ``source`` for a computer-use row when the caller names none.
#:
#: One of :class:`gideon.sel.SecurityEvent`'s documented interfaces (channel, dashboard,
#: cli, cron, subagent, background) rather than `DCU-1`'s subsystem-named
#: ``source="computer_use"``: an attempt always arrives *through* an interface, and the
#: capability itself is already named by ``event_type``/``tool_kind``, so spending ``source``
#: on it too would lose the one fact those two do not carry.
#:
#: Set explicitly rather than delegated to :func:`gideon.sel._infer_source`, which maps
#: an empty caller to ``"channel"`` — the catch-all its own comment describes as where
#: "unrecognized keys silently land". Recording an unattributed desktop-drive attempt as though
#: a human had typed it in a chat is the one misattribution that matters here, so an un-named
#: attempt is labelled unattended instead. Callers that know better pass ``source``.
_DEFAULT_SOURCE = "background"

#: Reserved ``metadata`` key recording that a caller passed a non-dict ``metadata``.
#: Present rather than dropped: a silently discarded argument is a caller bug nobody can see.
_SHAPE_KEY = "metadata_shape"

#: Longest prose this module writes into ``resources`` / ``error``, matching every other
#: SEL writer (:data:`gideon.sel._MAX_ARG_LEN`).
