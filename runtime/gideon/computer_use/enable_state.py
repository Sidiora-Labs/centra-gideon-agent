"""The KEYSTONE enable for desktop computer use (DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §3 floor 1, `DCU-1`).

Driving the desktop is the largest physical-world blast radius in this codebase: a process
that can press buttons and type into the operator's own applications can, in principle, do
anything the operator can. So the capability ships OFF, and the only thing that turns it on
is a file a human writes by hand. There is deliberately **no in-band path** — not a config
field, not a dashboard PATCH, not a tool, not a prompt, not a chat instruction — because
every one of those is reachable by the thing being restrained. :func:`is_enabled` is the
first check in the dispatch chain, before target policy, before the driver, before anything
that could touch an OS input API.

**The file, and why it is a document rather than a marker.** Default
``$GIDEON_HOME/governance/computer_use.enable.json``, overridable to an absolute path
with ``GIDEON_COMPUTER_USE_ENABLE_FILE`` (the option that gives a real trust root: put
it on a root-owned ``0444`` file outside the agent's home). It must contain the document
:data:`ENABLE_DOCUMENT` quotes verbatim — a version, the literal ``true``, and the ``apps``
allowlist naming what may be driven. A bare touch-a-marker file was rejected: an empty or
half-flushed file is indistinguishable from a deliberate one, so a truncated write — or any
stray process that creates the path — would read as ENABLED. A document with a required
positive shape fails the other way, which is the only acceptable direction here.

**Fail closed, in every direction.** Absent file, unreadable file, non-JSON bytes, wrong
root type, unknown version, unknown key, ``enabled`` that is not the literal ``true``, a
malformed ``apps`` entry → the capability is OFF and :func:`require_enabled` refuses with
WHAT/WHY/FIX. Nothing in this module can raise its way into an enabled state, and a parse
problem is never reported as "probably fine". Unknown keys are refused rather than ignored
for a specific reason: an operator writing ``{"enabled": true, "windows": ["Inbox"]}`` means
*"on, for that window"*, and a build that honoured the flag while dropping the scope would
grant strictly more than was asked. (``apps`` was that example until `DCU-2`; this build
enforces it, so it is an accepted key now and a scope key this build cannot honour has to be
spelled with something else.)

**The target allowlist lives HERE, not in config.** ``apps`` is the operator's list of
applications an armed process may drive, read only through :func:`allowed_apps`, and it is
stored in this document for exactly the reason ``enabled`` is. The allowlist is what stands
between "computer use is on" and "the agent may drive your password manager", so a
PATCH-editable home for it would hand an agent with config-write access a route to widen its
own reach — the same threat the keystone exists to close, one field over. An absent or empty
list means NO app may be driven: armed-with-no-targets is a state the system runs in
happily, and it is the only fail-closed reading available (see :func:`allowed_apps`).

**Where this sits relative to the guardrails ceiling.** It is the same shape as
:mod:`gideon.guardrails.ceiling` and deliberately reuses that module's operator-owned
directory, so the two share one trust root and one denylist entry. What the layer DOES buy,
each verified by a test in ``tests/test_computer_use_enable_state.py``:

* **No API write surface.** It is not config: absent from the dashboard's ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG``
  PATCH allowlist, with no PUT/POST of its own, so nothing the agent reaches over HTTP edits
  it.
* **Agent write paths refuse it.** ``governance/`` is in the built-in sensitive-path denylist,
  so ``security.is_sensitive_path`` — consulted by the action denylist, the files area and the
  bash read/write hooks — refuses reads and writes of the enable file.
* **No mid-run flip.** Read once and cached, so neither a tamper nor a legitimate enable
  changes the reach of the process already running. Turning the capability on costs a restart
  the operator performs themselves, which is the whole point of a keystone.
* **Tamper evidence.** Boot SEL-audits the resolved source, digest and outcome, so a machine
  that was armed — or that had its keystone flipped between runs — is attributable after the
  fact.

What it does NOT buy, stated plainly: OS-level immutability against a process running as the
operator. On a single-user machine the agent runs as the user, and no in-process check can
make a file unwritable by that uid. The denylist closes the write paths that go *through*
Gideon's own tools; it cannot close a raw ``open(..., "w")`` from arbitrary code
running as the same user. The only real trust root is ``GIDEON_COMPUTER_USE_ENABLE_FILE``
pointing at a file owned by another uid. A further honest limit: the denylist entry names the
default home (``~/.gideon/governance``), so a relocated ``GIDEON_HOME`` keeps the
no-mid-run-flip and no-API-surface properties but loses the tool-path refusal — another reason
the env override is the recommended posture.

#: worse than no FIX line, because it teaches the operator this message cannot be trusted.
