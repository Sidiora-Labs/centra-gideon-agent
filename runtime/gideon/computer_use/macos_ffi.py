"""The macOS accessibility FFI — the one module in this package that touches the OS (`DCU-3`).

**ctypes, not pyobjc, and that is the plan's own choice** (§3.2 names "macOS accessibility driver
over ctypes FFI"). It is also the cheaper one: every symbol this module needs lives in a system
framework that is present on every macOS install, so desktop computer use adds **no dependency
at all** — not even an optional extra. A ``pyobjc-framework-*`` extra would have to be installed
before the capability worked, would need an absent-import refusal path of its own, and would put
a compiled wheel in the way of a feature whose real gate is a TCC permission the operator grants
by hand. ``ctypes.util``-free absolute framework paths are used because they resolve without a
dyld search and fail loudly if a future macOS moves them.

**Nothing here runs at import time.** :func:`_load` is lazy and cached, and every entry point
converts a load failure into :class:`FFIUnavailable`. That is not tidiness: this module is
reachable from the gateway's process (via ``driver_host.resolve_driver``), and a module-level
framework load that raised on a non-Darwin build — or on a Darwin build where a framework had
moved — would turn an unavailable capability into a gateway that will not start.
``tests/test_computer_use_macos_driver.py::test_importing_the_ffi_touches_no_framework`` asserts
it by AST rather than by trusting this paragraph.

**The pointer boundary is drawn in this module and nowhere else.** Exactly one function warps
the operator's real cursor — :func:`click_global` — and it is the only caller of
``CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`` in the codebase. Element activation (:func:`press`,
:func:`perform_action`), value setting and typing post no mouse event of any kind, which is what
makes §3 floor 2's "the pointer never moves by accident" a property of the code rather than an
intention.
