"""TARGET POLICY for desktop computer use (DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §3.3, `DCU-2`).

Steps 2 and 4 of the dispatch chain the plan fixes:

1. :func:`gideon.computer_use.enable_state.is_enabled` — the keystone
2. :func:`check_app`                                         — **here**
3. index freshness (TTL) + fingerprint re-walk
4. :func:`check_input_target`                                — **here**
5. ``gate.require_computer_use``                             — SEL audit
6. the platform driver

**This module DECIDES; the gate only RECORDS.** Both functions raise, and nothing downstream
is allowed to be the thing that says no. A policy that returned a verdict for step 5 to act
on would make the audit trail load-bearing for enforcement, and an audit sink that fails
open — the correct posture for an audit sink — would then fail the *policy* open too. So the
refusal is raised at the decision point, and the SEL records what already happened.

**Two screens, two questions.** :func:`check_app` answers *may this application be driven at
all* — an allowlist a human wrote, where the empty list means nothing may be driven.
:func:`check_input_target` answers *may keystrokes land in this specific element* — a
password field, or a field already holding something credential-shaped, is refused even
inside an allowlisted app. The second is not redundant: an allowlisted browser or mail client
contains login forms, and "the app is approved" was never a statement about every field in it.

**No implicit self-allowance, deliberately.** The plan calls the mechanism a "self-plus-
operator allowlist". Gideon's own windows are NOT implicitly drivable here: the one
application where driving the desktop converts directly into *raising the agent's own
permissions* is Gideon itself — its approval dialogs, its settings, its enable
surfaces. So "self" is an ordinary entry an operator lists like any other app if they want
it, and an empty allowlist refuses everything including Gideon. The fail-closed
direction never needs an exemption; the widening would.

**One reader of the allowlist.** ``enable_state.allowed_apps()`` is called from exactly one
place in this module, through its owning module rather than a ``from``-imported alias, and its
result is never cached or copied into a constant.
:func:`~gideon.computer_use.enable_state.require_enabled` records what a second reader
costs: an earlier version of the keystone check read ``state.enabled`` beside ``is_enabled()``,
and forcing ``is_enabled`` to return True left every refusal test green. An allowlist with two
readers has the same failure available to it — and a module-level alias IS a second binding,
which is also why this module follows the package's documented
``from gideon.computer_use import enable_state`` convention instead.

**No second keystone reader either.** Neither function consults ``is_enabled()``. Step 1 owns
that decision, and a policy that re-checked it would be a second answer to a question already
answered — plus it would let a caller that skipped step 1 look gated when it is not.

    Step 4 of the dispatch chain: after the index is known fresh (so the element screened is
    the element that will be typed into, not a stale row describing something the user has
    since replaced) and before the driver.

    **What is screened.** *target* is one element as the snapshot publishes it: a flat mapping
    carrying at least a role, optionally a subrole, human-facing label text, and the element's
    existing value. Both spellings of every key are read — ``role`` and ``AXRole``, ``value``
    and ``AXValue`` — so a driver that forwards the raw AX dictionary is screened identically
    to one that maps it first. EVERY present spelling must pass, not the first one found: a
    target carrying ``role="AXTextField"`` beside ``AXRole="AXButton"`` describes two different
    elements, and screening whichever came first would let the caller choose which claim gets
    enforced. Reading more keys therefore only ever produces more refusals, never fewer.

    Unknown keys are IGNORED here, the deliberate opposite of the enable document's unknown-key
    refusal. That document is an operator's *instruction*, where an unenforced key means
    granting something other than what was asked; this dictionary is a *description* of an
    element, and a real AX element carries dozens of attributes this screen has no opinion
    about.

    **Unknown means no**, per shape:

    * not a mapping, or an empty one → refused; there is nothing to screen.
    * no role key at all → refused; an unidentified destination is an unknown one.
    * a role outside :data:`_EDITABLE_ROLES` → refused; "type into it" is undefined on a
      button, and on a role this build has never seen it is unknowable.
    * a subrole outside :data:`_ALLOWED_SUBROLES` → refused, with ``AXSecureTextField`` named
      in the message rather than reported as merely unrecognised.
    * any screened key present with a non-string value → refused as malformed.
    * a label/title/placeholder naming a secret (:data:`_SECRET_FIELD_TERMS`) → refused. This
      catches the commonest real password field: the web-view ``AXTextField`` titled
      "Password" that carries no secure subrole at all.
    * an existing value :func:`~gideon.security.redact_credentials` would redact →
      refused. That function is this codebase's ONE definition of credential-shaped text, so a
      string the system redacts on the way OUT is one this tool will not type INTO.

    **What is NOT screened, and why not here.** The text the caller is about to write is not
    part of the target and is not inspected: the contract takes a destination, and a screen
    that hopefully probed for a pending-text key the driver might not have named would report
    "clean" on text it never read — the exact hole the unknown-means-no rule above exists to
    close. Screening the outgoing string is a separate input with a separate parameter, not a
    guess inside this one.
