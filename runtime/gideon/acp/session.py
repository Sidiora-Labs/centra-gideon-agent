"""AcpSession — one ACP session's turn loop over a FrameRouter queue (P9 step 2).

The demux consumer side of concurrent ACP. Where today's ``AcpClient`` reads the
process's stdout INLINE during a turn (serializing all turns behind one lock),
an ``AcpSession`` owns a single ``sessionId`` and consumes ONLY that session's
queue — the :class:`FrameRouter` fans the shared stdout out to per-session queues,
so N sessions each await their own queue and run concurrently on one process.

This module is the session-scoped turn loop + its staleness/liveness/cancel logic,
pulled out of the monolithic client so it can be built and tested standalone against
a fake router queue — no real process, no stdout. The connection shell that owns the
process + router + spawns these sessions composes it next (step 2b). Gated by
``ACPDialect.supports_concurrent_sessions`` — the one-session ``AcpClient`` path
stays authoritative until a proven backend opts in.

Key invariant preserved from the inline loop: a session keeps a per-*session* turn
lock (one ``session/prompt`` in flight per session is still true — ACP answers one
prompt per session at a time), but there is NO process-wide lock, so co-tenant
sessions are never blocked by each other.
