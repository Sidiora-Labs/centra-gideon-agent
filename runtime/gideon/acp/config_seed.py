"""Marker-scoped, reversible seeding of a CLI's own MCP config.

Prong B of ACP-AGENT-PARITY §2.1, for the CLIs that ignore protocol-passed
``mcpServers`` at ``session/new``. kiro is the measured case: the host already
generates a complete ``$GIDEON_HOME/agents/gideon.json`` whose
``mcpServers.gideon-core`` is correct, but kiro's only two agent-discovery
roots are ``<cwd>/.kiro/agents`` and ``~/.kiro/agents`` — it prints them itself in
``kiro-cli agent list`` — so the file is never read (`K6`, `G31`). Seeding makes
the file discoverable from a root kiro actually reads.

**The seeding contract** (plan `:139`), which every function here obeys:

1. *Marker-scoped.* We never edit a user file. We create exactly one path we own
   and we record it in a **receipt** under our own home
   (``$GIDEON_HOME/acp_seeds.json``). The receipt — not a guess about the
   file's contents — is what makes a seed identifiable as ours.
2. *Idempotent.* Seeding an already-correct seed is a no-op that reports
   ``already_seeded``; it does not rewrite, re-stat or re-audit anything.
3. *Never clobber user config outside our block.* A pre-existing path we did not
   write is left exactly as-is and the seed is refused
   (``skipped_user_owned``). Every other file in the CLI's config directory is
   untouched — we address one path by name.
4. *Reversible.* Unseeding removes exactly what the receipt says we wrote, and
   only while the on-disk state still matches it. A seed the user has since
   replaced is disowned, not deleted (``skipped_diverged``).
5. *Audited.* Every seed and unseed decision, including the refusals, emits a SEL
   event.

A symlink (not a copy) is the seeded artifact so the seed cannot go stale when the
generated config is refreshed at install time, and so "what did we write" has a
single verifiable answer: a link at a known path pointing at a known target.
