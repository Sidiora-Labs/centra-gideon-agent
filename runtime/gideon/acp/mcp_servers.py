"""The ``gideon-core`` MCP server rendered in ACP ``session/new`` wire shape.

Prong A of ACP-AGENT-PARITY §2.1. The native tool registry (knowledge / tasks /
loops / inbox / artifacts / workflows / subagents / web) reaches an ACP CLI only
through the ``gideon-core`` stdio MCP server. Before this module every live
``session/new`` sent ``"mcpServers": []``, so an ACP session had none of it — the
single largest capability cliff in the ACP parity audit (gap 1).

The server spec itself is NOT invented here: :data:`gideon.agent.
_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS` is the one source of truth for what ``gideon-core``
is (command + args), and the kiro-targeted ``agents/gideon.json`` generator
already renders the same entry. This module only translates that spec into the
ACP protocol's shape and attaches the environment the server needs to answer as
*this* session.

Two shapes, one spec:

* the agent-config shape is a **mapping** keyed by server name
  (``{"gideon-core": {"command": ..., "args": [...]}}``);
* the ACP ``session/new`` shape is an **array** of objects that each carry their
  own ``name``, and whose ``env`` is an array of ``{"name", "value"}`` pairs.

Env is declared explicitly rather than relied upon by inheritance. The CLI
inherits the gateway's environment (``transport.py`` spawns with ``{**os.environ}``)
and its MCP children would normally inherit that in turn, but a CLI is free to
spawn MCP servers with a filtered environment. Two variables decide whether the
server answers correctly at all, so neither may be left to inheritance:

``GIDEON_HOME``
    ``mcp_core`` resolves ``config_dir()`` for the IPC secret, the gateway port
    file and the ``session_pid_<pid>.txt`` files. Losing it sends an
    isolated-home session's tool calls at the operator's real home.

``GIDEON_SESSION_KEY``
    the session inject-back. ``mcp_core._resolve_session_key`` prefers this env
    var and only falls back to walking the process tree for a
    ``session_pid_<pid>.txt`` file. Declaring it makes inject-back exact instead
    of dependent on an ancestor walk through the CLI's own process tree.

    ``session_key`` is the live session key (``AcpClient._session_key`` /

    because the pool rekeys a warm process between sessions — a spec captured in
