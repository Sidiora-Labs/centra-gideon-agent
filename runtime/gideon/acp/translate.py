"""ACP frame → AcpEvent decoders — the pure translation surface (P9 cutover step 2).

The one-session :class:`~gideon.acp.client.AcpClient` and the multi-session
:class:`~gideon.acp.session.AcpSession` both turn raw ``session/update`` frames
into :class:`~gideon.acp.types.AcpEvent`s. This module is that decoding logic in
ONE place so the two turn loops can never drift — a ``tool_call`` frame becomes the same
event whether it arrived on the inline client reader or a router-demuxed session queue.

Every function here is pure: no ``self``, no I/O, no process. The small per-turn caches
the decoders read/write (``tool_call_inputs`` and ``tool_call_seen`` keyed by
``toolCallId``, ``offered_options`` keyed by request id) are threaded in as explicit dict
params — the caller owns them.
Dependencies are the leaf ``types`` module + the ``security`` redactors + stdlib, so both
the client and the session import from here with no import cycle.

# ── the tool-result FAILURE bit, derived runtime-agnostically ────────────────
#
# `AAP-6` §2.3 gap 5. The loop breaker, the procedural-outcome accumulator and the
# tool card all read ONE bit: did this tool call fail. Reading it off the ACP
# `status` field alone made that bit a per-CLI lottery, measured:
#
#   codex  → status="failed",    rawOutput {"formatted_output": "boom\n", "exit_code": 3}
#   kiro   → status="completed", rawOutput {"items":[{"Json":{"exit_status":
#                                "exit status: 3", "stdout": "", "stderr": "boom\n"}}]}
#
# Both ran `bash -c 'echo boom >&2; exit 3'`. kiro calls a non-zero-exit command a
# COMPLETED tool call — it completed the act of running it — so a status-only reading
# left every kiro failure signed as a success and the whole warn/block/circuit path
# inert on that runtime (measured live: ten consecutive failing calls, zero notices).
# Neither CLI is wrong; they answer different questions. So the host stops asking the
# CLI to agree and derives the bit itself: trust a DECLARED failure, and otherwise look
# for a declared non-zero process exit in the result payload.
#
# Deliberately KEY-BASED, never a scan of the output prose. `grep -c error`, a test
# runner printing "1 failed", or a file whose contents say "exit 1" are all successful
# tool calls, and a text heuristic would sign them failed — a breaker that aborts a
# healthy turn is worse than one that misses a failure. For the same reason the scan
# never touches `rawInput`: kiro's own input for the measured call is
# `{"command": "bash -c 'echo boom >&2; exit 3'"}`, so a whole-frame scan would call
# EVERY invocation of that command a failure regardless of how it exited.
