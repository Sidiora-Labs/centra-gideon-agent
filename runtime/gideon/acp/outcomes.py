"""Per-turn tool-outcome accumulation for the ACP seam (``G7`` / AAP-8).

Procedural memory (M5d) learns "tool X works / fails for this shape" from the
``(tool, outcome)`` pairs a runtime accumulated during the turn. The dashboard reads
them through one duck-typed hook — ``drain_tool_outcomes`` — which until now existed
on exactly ONE provider (:class:`gideon.agents.native.runtime.NativeAgentRuntime`).
For an ACP provider ``getattr(provider, "drain_tool_outcomes", None)`` returned ``None``,
so ``after_turn_review.record_procedural_outcomes`` was handed an empty list and a
six-tool-call ACP turn produced ZERO procedural rows. That is the whole of ``G7``.

Two deliberate choices, both about not deriving anything a second way:

* **The failure bit is read, never re-derived.** ``acp/translate.py`` already stamps
  ``tool_meta = {"ok": False}`` on a ``failed`` tool result (present-and-False only on
  failure, absent on success — the native runtime's ``tool_meta`` contract). This
  accumulator reads that key. It does NOT look at the ACP ``status`` field again, so
  the loop breaker and procedural memory cannot disagree about whether a call failed.
* **The outcome vocabulary is imported, never re-spelled.** Members come from
  :data:`gideon.memory_service.PROCEDURAL_OUTCOMES`; anything else is dropped
  with a warning here, before it can reach a store whose surfacing rules do not map it.

The ACP seam can only observe two of the three members. ``denied`` requires a denial
*observation* authored by ``security.classify_denial`` — the native runtime has one
because it refuses the call itself. On the ACP seam the CLI owns the refusal and a
rejected permission arrives as an ordinary failed (or absent) tool result, so there is
no honest ``denied`` signal to read. Inventing one would be a second derivation.
