"""Deterministic scripted model provider — a real bound provider with zero network.

``ScriptedProvider`` is a :class:`~gideon.llm.base.ModelProvider` whose whole
turn stream comes out of a JSON file. It exists so a gateway can boot and complete a
real chat turn with **no credentials and no network** — the offline half of the e2e
floor. It is a fixture, not a model: it never infers anything, it replays.

Why a file and not a Python fixture object: the e2e boot, a pytest test and a
hand-run ``gideon gateway`` all need to drive *different* scripts, and only one
of those three can pass a Python object. A path keeps the script a piece of test data
rather than a code change.

Design constraint that shapes everything below: **byte-identical output for the same
script and the same prompt sequence.** Nothing emitted is derived from the wall clock,
``random``, the prompt text, the tool list, the model name or the reasoning effort.
Token counts, ``duration_ms`` and context usage all come out of the script. The only
state that advances is a turn counter, so turn *N* of a process always emits turn *N*
of the script.

Zero network by construction: this module imports ``json``/``os``/``pathlib`` plus
``llm.base`` and ``llm.events``. ``tests/test_scripted_provider.py`` proves it two ways
rather than grepping for a word — it walks the ASTs of this module and its module-scope
first-party closure for any HTTP client, socket or vendor SDK, and it measures in a
subprocess that importing this module adds **no** networking module to ``sys.modules``
beyond what ``import gideon.llm`` already loaded (the package ``__init__``s pull
``socket``/``ssl``/``urllib``/``jsonschema`` on their own; this module adds nothing).

Safety gate — why it takes the strong option
--------------------------------------------
A fake provider that could be bound in a real home would fabricate model answers under
the user's own assistant identity, and nothing downstream can tell a replayed sentence
from an inferred one. So construction is refused unless **two independent conditions**
hold, and every refusal is a loud typed error (never a silent degrade to a no-op
provider, which would look like a working assistant giving canned answers):

1. ``GIDEON_SCRIPTED_MODEL_SCRIPT`` names a readable script file. The env var
   *is* the script path rather than a boolean, so enabling the fake and saying exactly
   what it will reply are the same act — there is no "on" state with a built-in default
   reply. A stray ``=1`` in a shell profile cannot enable it. ``GIDEON_``-prefixed
   per repo convention; ``MODEL`` in the name keeps it distinct from harness variables.
2. ``GIDEON_HOME`` is set and does not resolve to ``~/.gideon``.

Condition 2 is the deliberate choice of the stronger option, for a measured reason:
``save_credential()`` (``config/loader.py``) mirrors *any* stored credential key into
``os.environ``, so an env-only gate is in principle reachable from the credential store
— a surface reachable through the API. The home condition is not reachable that way in
any harmful form: smuggling ``GIDEON_HOME`` through the same mirror relocates the
home *away* from the real one, which is precisely the safe outcome. The property this
buys is the one worth having — **the fake can never answer inside the user's real
assistant home** — and the cost is one env var in an e2e boot and in tests, both of
which already run against an isolated home. This follows the in-repo precedent that
``--approval yolo`` is refused unless ``GIDEON_HOME`` is explicitly non-default
and ``--seed`` refuses the real home outright.

Neither condition is reachable by ``config.json`` alone: config carries no environment
block, and the provider reads the environment, never config. Both are re-checked in
:meth:`ScriptedProvider.start` as well as ``__init__``, because ``GIDEON_HOME`` is
re-read live throughout the codebase and a home that moved between construction and
start would otherwise slip through.

Script file format (version 1)
------------------------------
::

    {
      "version": 1,                        // required, must be 1
      "context_usage_pct": 12.5,           // optional; OMITTED => None
      "on_exhausted": "repeat_last",       // "repeat_last" (default) | "error"
      "turns": [                           // required, non-empty; Nth prompt -> Nth turn
        {
          "expect_prompt": "hello",        // optional substring guard on the prompt
          "text": "Hi there.",             // one text chunk  (mutually exclusive
          "chunks": ["Hi ", "there."],     //   with a list of chunks)
          "thinking": ["weighing it"],     // optional thinking chunks, emitted first
          "tool_calls": [
            {
              "id": "call-1",              // required
              "name": "read_file",         // required (becomes LLMEvent.title)
              "input": {"path": "R.md"},   // optional, any JSON
              "risk_level": "safe",        // optional: safe|caution|destructive
              "requires_approval": true,   // optional: emit a PERMISSION_REQUEST first
              "options": ["allow", "deny"] // optional, only with requires_approval
            }
          ],
          "stop_reason": "end_turn",       // optional
          "usage": {                       // optional; each field defaults to 0
            "input_tokens": 42, "output_tokens": 9,
            "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_read_tokens": 0
          },
          "context_usage_pct": 13.0,       // optional per-turn override
          "duration_ms": 0                 // optional
        }
      ]
    }

Unknown keys are rejected at every level. A fixture is only useful if a typo in it is
loud, so ``"chunk"`` for ``"chunks"`` raises instead of silently emitting nothing.

Event order within a turn mirrors what the real adapters emit: thinking chunks, then
text chunks, then for each tool call an optional ``EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST`` followed
by ``EVENT_TOOL_CALL``, then exactly one terminal ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` carrying the
token counts and ``context_usage_pct``.

``context_usage_pct`` is ``None`` when the script omits it. ``None`` and ``0.0`` are
different answers in this codebase — ``None`` means "never measured" and consumers must
omit the number rather than render a fabricated 0% — so a script that says nothing about
context usage produces ``None``, not zero.

Approvals: ``requires_approval`` tool calls are recorded as pending and resolved by
:meth:`ScriptedProvider.approve_tool` / :meth:`ScriptedProvider.reject_tool`, whose
decisions are readable via :attr:`ScriptedProvider.decisions`. Resolving an id that was
never pending is recorded, not raised — a fixture must not turn a caller's defensive
approve into a crash mid-turn. What tests assert is the recorded decision list.
