"""Generic ACP-over-stdio agent provider.

Spawns an external CLI that speaks the open Agent Client Protocol
(JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio) and translates ACP events into ``LLMEvent``s.

This module is vendor-neutral: it knows nothing about specific ACP agent CLIs,
hardcoded internal binary discovery paths, or any specific bot-name
branding. The launch command is supplied by the caller (typically a
``ProviderEntry``'s ``options.command``); ``claude`` is one possible
backend, [Zed's ACP-compliant agents](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol)
are another.

Capabilities are negotiated through the ACP ``initialize`` handshake:
``declared_capabilities`` reflects the capability set declared by the
spawned agent in its initialize response (R5.4).
