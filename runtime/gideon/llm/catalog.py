"""Model catalog / management / connectivity — the provider-agnostic seam.

A model provider's *inference* path (build + resolve, ``registry.build``) is one
axis; its *catalog* — "what models can I use, can I reach it, and (for local
managers) pull/delete them" — is a separate axis the dashboard's Settings → Models
surface drives. This module defines that second axis as an interface so core stops
hardcoding per-type knowledge (ollama ``/api/tags`` vs an OpenAI ``/v1/models`` vs
Bedrock's boto3 control plane, an in-core hardcoded Anthropic list, …) in the HTTP
handlers.

Two ABCs:

* :class:`ModelCatalog` — every model provider can expose one: ``list_models`` +
  ``test_connection``. Pure function of the entry's stored config — it must NOT open
  a chat session / call ``start()`` / need a ``session_key`` (a Settings dropdown
  hitting discovery must never spin up the live provider).
* :class:`ModelManager` — the OPTIONAL management axis (search a remote catalog,
  pull/delete/show a local model). Ollama is the reference implementer (it owns
  local model download/management); a future LMStudio/other local runner can
  implement it too. Core gates the management endpoints on
  ``isinstance(cat, ModelManager)``.

Registration mirrors :func:`ProviderRegistry.register_type`: a provider registers a
catalog FACTORY for its type via :func:`ProviderRegistry.register_catalog`, invoked
as the same import-time side effect (the app loader imports the app's ``provider.py``
at enable-time). Core resolves an entry → its catalog
with :func:`ProviderRegistry.catalog_of`, fail-soft (no catalog registered → the
provider simply has no discovery, handled as an empty result, never a crash).

The catalog factory contract:

    def create_catalog(options: dict, *, model: str = "") -> ModelCatalog: ...

``options`` is the entry's stored options bag (endpoint / api_key / region /
profile / …); ``model`` is the entry's pinned model (rarely needed for listing).
