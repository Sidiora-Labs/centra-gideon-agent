"""Provider registry: maps types to factories and named entries to instances.

Holds two pieces of state:

1. A mapping from provider *type* (``"openai"``, ``"anthropic"``, ``"acp_agent"``,
   ...) to a ``(ProviderCapability, ProviderFactory)`` pair, registered at
   import time by the concrete provider modules.
2. A mapping from configured Provider_Entry *name* to the corresponding
   :class:`ProviderEntry` instance, registered after config load.

The registry validates two invariants at registration time:

* The entry's ``type`` is a known type (Requirement R1.3).
* The entry's ``declared_capabilities`` are a subset of the type's
  registered capability set (Requirement R1.4).

It does NOT instantiate providers eagerly; :meth:`ProviderRegistry.build`
invokes the registered factory on demand. This module is loaded as a side
effect of importing :mod:`gideon.providers` and MUST NOT import any
provider SDK (``anthropic``, ``openai``, ``httpx``); Property 11
(Provider SDK Lazy Import) depends on this guarantee.
