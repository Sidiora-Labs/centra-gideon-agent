"""ModelProvider ABC and provider-agnostic event types.

``ModelProvider`` is the inference-axis base — a model provider is not always an
LLM (it may serve chat, embedding, STT/TTS, vision, image-gen, or doc-parse), so
the abstraction is named for the model, not the modality. All inference backends
(ACP, OpenAI-compatible, Ollama, Claude Code, ...) implement ``ModelProvider``.
Consumers (handler, gateway, CLI) depend only on this interface, never on a
concrete provider.

The stateless completion contract (``complete()`` + ``supports_tools``) lives on
this same base: it owns **no** session, agent loop, or tool execution — those
belong to an ``AgentProvider`` (the native loop). ``complete()`` is the
loop-facing contract the native agent loop calls turn-by-turn; the four HTTP
adapters (openai / anthropic / ollama / vllm) and bedrock implement it. ACP is
also an ``AgentProvider``, not a stateless completion adapter.
