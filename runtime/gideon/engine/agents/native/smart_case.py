"""Smart case: when letter case decides a match for the file tools' patterns.

``grep`` matched with ``query in line`` and ``glob`` matched names exactly, so a model searching for
"dentist" never saw a line that said "Dentist", and the regular expression ``pick up`` never saw
"Pick up". The rule here is the one ripgrep and fd call smart case: a pattern with no capital letter
matches whatever the case, and one with a capital matches it exactly, because a capital is the one
sign that the case was meant. A call's ``ignore_case``, true or false, overrides it either way.

In a regular expression only the letters it matches count. An escape (``\\S``, ``\\W``, ``\\D``,
``\\B``, ``\\A``, ``\\Z``, a character by ``\\N{name}`` or by code), a group's name and the inline
flags are syntax, so ``pick\\Wup`` still matches any case. A capital in a class (``[A-Z]``) is a
capital the pattern matches, so it keeps case.
