"""The decision-journal tool schemas, kept out of :mod:`builtin_tools`.

Extracted at integration for a structural reason, not a stylistic one.
``tests/test_structural_baseline.py::test_the_watch_band_is_not_sitting_on_a_cliff``
demands >=100 lines of headroom below the 2800-line watch band, and PA-4's three tools
pushed ``builtin_tools.py`` to 2701 — headroom 99, red. That rail's own docstring records
this same file already forcing the band from 2500 to 2800, and its instruction is to
"Split that file now ... Do NOT silently widen it."

So the three ``ToolDefinition``s live here. Nothing about the tools changed: the category
mapping, the dispatch methods and the call-site rails all stay in ``builtin_tools``, and
this module only owns their schemas. The domain vocabulary is still read from
:mod:`gideon.cognition.decisions` rather than spelled out, so the tool cannot advertise a
domain that module rejects.
