"""The Inbox tool schemas, and the text the Inbox read hands the model, kept out of
:mod:`builtin_tools`.

Beside the other ``*_tool_defs`` modules for the same structural reason: ``builtin_tools.py`` sits
under the 2800-line watch band (``tests/test_structural_baseline.py``), so a tool's schema lives
here while its category mapping and dispatch method stay there.

Two tools, one write and one read. ``post_to_inbox`` surfaces a message to the owner.
``inbox_list`` reads what is waiting: an agent asked "what is waiting in my inbox" — the Morning
briefing preset's own words — had no tool that could answer, and a read-only automation could not
call the write. It declares itself a read (``RiskLevel.SAFE``), so a read grant admits it. It reads
what the conversation it works for may read (``inbox_reach``): its own items and those about no
conversation, every one for a tool you run from your own pages.
