"""Desktop shell registry — the gateway's half of the capability bridge (DC-2 C2).

The Electron shell owns the only truthful view of the host's native capability
state (macOS TCC status, whether a tray is available, whether a hotkey chord
registered). The gateway cannot query any of it: it is a plain HTTP server that
may equally be serving a browser tab with no shell at all. So the shell PUSHES
its capability manifest here on boot, and every other consumer (the Settings
panel, an app with a ``desktop`` permission) reads this registry instead of
guessing.

Security posture (ARCC was unavailable for this change, so the reasoning is
written out rather than cited):

* **Fail closed.** An unregistered gateway reports ``connected: false`` and an
  EMPTY capability map. There is no permissive default anywhere in this module —
  a caller can never read a capability the shell did not assert.
* **The ``shell_token`` is a credential.** It is minted here with
  :func:`secrets.token_urlsafe`, kept in memory only (never written to disk,
  never returned by :meth:`DesktopRegistry.snapshot`, never placed in a log line
  or an error body), and compared with :func:`hmac.compare_digest` so a wrong
  token cannot be recovered by timing the comparison. It is handed to exactly one
  process — the Electron MAIN process, over loopback, in the response body of a
  request that already proved it can read ``$GIDEON_HOME/.local_secret``.
  The renderer never sees it: the preload bridge exposes ``probe``/``request``/
  ``on`` and no token accessor, so page JS has no path to the value even if a
  page is compromised.
* **Bootstrapping off ``.local_secret`` rather than a new secret file** is
  deliberate. Any process that can read the home directory can already mint a
  full API token via ``GET /api/token/local``; a second on-disk secret would add
  a file to back up and leak without moving that boundary. The per-session
  ``shell_token`` this module mints is narrower than the local secret (it
  authorizes ``/api/desktop`` writes and nothing else) and dies with the process.

State lives on ``DashboardState.desktop`` — one registry per gateway instance,
so tests get isolation for free and nothing survives a restart (a shell that
outlives a gateway restart re-registers; see ``main.js``).
