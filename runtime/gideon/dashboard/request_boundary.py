"""The middleware that turns an unguarded request-shape fault into the wire envelope, once.

Fourteen-plus ``/api/*`` handlers read the request body or a query/path parameter
without first checking its shape: ``body.get(...)`` on a body that parsed to a list,
``int(request.query.get("limit"))`` on a non-numeric string, ``.strip()`` on a
non-string field. A slightly-off request therefore raises an unhandled
``AttributeError``/``ValueError``/``TypeError`` and aiohttp answers its bare
``500 text/plain`` "Server got itself in trouble" — which a JSON client cannot parse,
so it cannot tell "I sent bad input" from "the server broke". That breaks the one
wire error-envelope contract (``AGENTS.md`` §"Shared conventions" → **Error envelope
(HTTP)**) the same way an unnormalized 405 did (#2846, fixed in ``spa_fallback``).

Answering it per handler would mean a ``try``/``except`` around every body read and
every ``int()`` — the class was filed against ``/api/tasks`` (#2855), task comments
(#554) and thirteen more POST routes (#2861), and the codebase had already been
closing it one endpoint at a time (``handlers_inbox`` digest ``hours``, ``chat_folders``
``order``, the tasks-comments body guard), which is exactly how a systemic gap stays
open: the next route forgets. So it is answered once here — any route may let a
request-shape fault propagate, and every route reports it identically as
``400 {"error": {"code": "bad_request", ...}}``.

**Why 400, and which faults.** The three builtin types below are the "unguarded
request-shape access" family: a bad numeric parameter (``ValueError`` from ``int()``/
``float()``), a body that parsed to a non-object (``AttributeError`` from ``.get()`` on
a list, ``TypeError`` from a coercion), or ``.strip()`` on a non-string scalar. The
codebase already answers this family ``400`` wherever a handler happened to guard it
(see ``tests/test_gateway_4xx_not_500.py``); this makes 400 the default for the routes
that did not. The raw exception is logged, never returned: the client gets the stable
envelope and its generic sentence, and the traceback stays in ``gateway.log`` — the
current behavior leaks the internal fault to the client, this one does not.

**What it deliberately does NOT catch.** ``web.HTTPException`` is re-raised untouched:
a handler that answers 404/400/redirect on purpose, and the router's 404/405 that
``spa_fallback`` normalizes, are already-formed responses, not faults to reinterpret.
Every other exception type (``RuntimeError``, ``OSError``, ``KeyError``, a custom
service error, …) also propagates unchanged, so a genuine server bug keeps surfacing as
a ``500`` rather than being mislabelled a client error — the same reasoning
``invalid_id_gate`` states for staying innermost. The envelope is scoped to ``/api/*``
(as ``spa_fallback``'s normalization is): a fault on an HTML/static route propagates
unchanged, because a JSON envelope is the wrong answer for a browser and this class is
``/api``-only.

**Placement.** Installed just OUTSIDE ``invalid_id_middleware`` in ``server.py``'s
explicit ordering, so ``invalid_id`` (which maps ``UnsafeRecordId`` — not a
``ValueError`` subclass — to its own ``invalid_id`` code) still runs closest to the
handler and this gate never shadows it. It reuses the already-registered ``bad_request``
wire code, so no new code is minted and the append-only registry rail is untouched.
