"""The triage digest over HTTP (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §5.1, §5.4) — PA-5.

Three endpoints, and the split between them is §5.1's "strictly read-only on view; acting is
explicit" made structural:

``GET  /api/proactive/digest``        the whole card. Reads only.
``POST /api/proactive/digest/reply``  one tap, or one typed channel reply. The only writer.
``POST /api/proactive/install``       §5.4's pack card: install the schedule, or reconcile it.

**The reply route is the ONE new caller of an existing execution seam, not a new seam.** A tap
on "yes" runs through :func:`gideon.proactive.autoexec.auto_execute` with a synthetic
approve rule standing for the user's click — so the incident kill switch, the action denylist,
``enforce_action``'s SEL row and the NEW-1 budget floor all apply to an attended approval exactly
as they apply to an unattended one. Writing a second dispatch here would have been a sixth
unattended-write seam (AG §1.2) that the chokepoint test would have caught and that nothing
would have gated in the meantime.

**Idempotency is the run's own ledger, not a new store.** Every answered ordinal leaves a
``triage_reply`` row on the digest's run, so a reply that arrives twice — a double tap, a retried
channel delivery, a reply typed after the gateway restarted — finds the first row and acks
instead of acting again (criterion 9). A reply naming a run that is no longer the current digest
is refused with ``digest_expired``: the ordinals in an old digest number a different window, so
best-effort execution there is precisely the wrong-target execution the criterion forbids.

**Nothing here reports an unmeasured value as a zero.** A failed read returns the error and the
card renders it; see :mod:`gideon.proactive.surface` for the state vocabulary that keeps
"off", "never run", "empty" and "broken" four different answers.

Every failure leaves through :func:`~gideon.http_errors.json_error` — the ONE structured
wire envelope `AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" declares. Not a style choice: the flat
``{"error": "<prose>"}`` shape is a RATCHETED, shrinking population
(`tests/test_wire_error_envelope_census.py`), so a new route emitting it would be a new site a
client can only branch on by matching prose. The digest card branches on the codes below.
