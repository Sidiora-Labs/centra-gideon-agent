provenance,
evidence manifests, and risk-tier metadata; accept installs, reject dismisses — and the model cannot
accept its own proposals under any trust mode". Everything behind that sentence shipped in S75/S76
and
had no HTTP surface, so the criterion was unmet for want of a route: `inbox.build_view` and
`StagingStore.week` both return fully-serialized shapes, and this module wires them.

**The actor is load-bearing.** S75 measured that `proposals.accept()` knew nothing about who
was calling it, and put `require_human` inside it. A route that omitted the actor would default to
`user` and hand every caller — including an app-scoped token — the reviewer's authority. So the
actor is
DERIVED from the request rather than accepted from the body: a caller that could name itself `user`
would make the gate decorative.

    sample. Read-only: composing the block writes to no learning store.

    LV-3's task row asked for this to register with plan 42's digest builder. No such
    builder exists in the tree, so the same block renders on the skills page header —
    the fallback the task row and the atom's `done_when` both sanction. A digest
    builder, when it arrives, calls `compose_learning_summary` rather than
    reimplementing the gather.

    The facts group is memory content, so a temporary session (`blocks_reads`) gets the
    summary WITHOUT it — matching `/api/lessons`, which returns an empty list for the
    same caller. The skill and proposal groups are not memory and stay visible.
