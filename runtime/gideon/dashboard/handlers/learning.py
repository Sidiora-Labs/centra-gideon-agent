"""Learning routes — the Proposal Inbox and the staging week panel (§6.1 / §7 — S78).

GET    /api/learning/proposals            the inbox: six kinds, ordered, filterable
GET    /api/learning/proposals/{id}       one proposal, full record
POST   /api/learning/proposals/{id}/accept   install (human reviewers only)
DELETE /api/learning/proposals/{id}       reject (human reviewers only)
GET    /api/learning/staging/week         the week-at-a-glance capture panel

The plan's success criterion 1 says "One Proposal Inbox SHOWS all six proposal kinds with
provenance,
evidence manifests, and risk-tier metadata; accept installs, reject dismisses — and the model cannot
accept its own proposals under any trust mode". Everything behind that sentence shipped in S75/S76
and
had no HTTP surface, so the criterion was unmet for want of a route: `inbox.build_view` and
`StagingStore.week` both return fully-serialized shapes, and this module wires them.

**The actor is load-bearing.** S75 measured that `proposals.accept()` knew nothing about who
was calling it, and put `require_human` inside it. A route that omitted the actor would default to
`user` and hand every caller — including an app-scoped token — the reviewer's authority. So the
actor is
DERIVED from the request rather than accepted from the body: a caller that could name itself `user`
would make the gate decorative.
