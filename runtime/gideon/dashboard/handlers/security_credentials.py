"""The credential-store surface — where secrets live, and the consented move (SH-2).

Three routes, registered beside the rest of ``/api/security/*``:

* ``GET  /api/security/credentials`` — the whole read: active backend, resolved-vs-requested,
  how many keys are still in ``.env``, and whether a rollback is available.
* ``POST /api/security/credentials/migrate`` — runs ``credentials_to_keychain``.
* ``POST /api/security/credentials/rollback`` — restores the pre-migration ``.env``.

**Owner-only, categorically.** An app must not learn the NAMES of the owner's credentials,
let alone move them between stores — same reasoning and same shape as the audit surface's
refusal (``security_audit._refuse_app``): the app-permission middleware is an allowlist, so
an app that merely declares ``/api/security`` would pass it, and this is the flat no.

**Both writes require ``confirm: true`` in the body.** The flag is not decoration — it is the
protocol-level record that the caller showed the snapshot step. The core refuses without it
independently of this handler, so a future second caller cannot skip the consent by not
knowing about it.

**No secret VALUE crosses this boundary in either direction.** The payloads carry key NAMES
and counts only. The migration reads and writes credentials entirely inside the process; the
browser is told what moved, never what it was.
