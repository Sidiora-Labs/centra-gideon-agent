"""The L2 surface-overlay read endpoint (AMBIENT-SURFACES §6 / AS-6).

One route. It is a READ of ``$GIDEON_HOME/surfaces/`` — there is deliberately no
write endpoint: an overlay is authored by the user or by an agent through the ordinary
file tools, so adding an HTTP writer here would mint a second producer with a second set
of refusals. The loader (`gideon.surface_overlay`) owns the threat posture; this
handler owns nothing but the JSON.

Refusals come back on a **200** alongside the accepted overlays, the same shape the tile
action refusal uses: the FE renders "your overlay names a component that does not exist"
beside the surface it belongs to, and a 4xx would make that indistinguishable from a
broken request.
