# calculator or a second capability evaluator here would be a surface that disagrees with the

#   session_key       → `triggers.wakeup.session_key_for`
#   capability_grants → `triggers.screen.requested_capabilities` + `provider_is_read_only` +
#                       `unfenced_actions` (the same three the firepath capability gate calls)
#   observe_mode      → `triggers.tools.run(dry_run=True, runner=None)`, which is exactly what
#                       `mcp_automation`'s `automation_run` dispatches a `dry_run` to, plus the
