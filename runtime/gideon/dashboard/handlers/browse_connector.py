"""The browse user-browser CONNECTOR endpoint — the non-test writer of the BA-7 seam.

BA-7 shipped ``browse.target.register_connector(device_id, cdp_url)`` as the writer of the
process-global "is the operator's own browser attached right now" registry, and left it
with no non-test caller ON PURPOSE: nothing could honestly answer that question until the
attaching client existed. This module is that caller. It is the loopback surface a paired
device announces its CDP page-target endpoint on, so a ``user_browser`` browse task
(BA-7's second execution target) has somewhere to run and ``resolve_cdp_url`` has an
endpoint to hand the CDP transport.

**Loopback only, and no new listening surface.** The connector is the operator's own
browser on the SAME machine as the gateway, so its endpoint is reached over loopback and
these routes refuse any non-loopback caller — on the raw TCP peer, never an ``X-Real-IP``
a proxy or a caller could spoof. They mount on the gateway's EXISTING dashboard server, so
no second socket is opened, and the endpoint a device announces is validated against the
shipped ``LOOPBACK_INTERNAL`` egress rail before it is stored — so a public ``cdp_url``
cannot be registered even by a loopback caller. That is why registration is the structural
gate: the transport's own ``connect`` is not egress-guarded, so "the connector endpoint is
loopback" has to be made true here or nowhere.

**Paired via the shipped device-session machinery (COMPANION-APPS §C1/C2), not a second
one.** The announcing client is an ordinary paired device: it holds the session cookie
``pair/complete`` minted, and the ``device_id`` handed to :func:`register_connector` is the
one the pairing registry already knows — so the attached browser IS a row in
``GET /api/devices``, listed as a connected device rather than tracked by a parallel
notion. A session with no ``device`` provenance (the owner's own dashboard tab) is refused:
only a paired device may attach as the connector.

**No browser-vendor knowledge in core.** This module names a *paired device* and a *CDP
page-target endpoint*; which browser produced that endpoint, and the extension that speaks
the typed local contract (navigate / read-outline / click / type / close) to it, live
entirely in the removable app bundle (BA-8, apps repo). ``tests/test_browse_connector_route``
rails this module against every browser-vendor name so a future edit cannot leak one in.
