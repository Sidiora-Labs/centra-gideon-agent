"""The security audit surface — the paginated SEL read and its chain verification.

Two routes, registered beside the rest of ``/api/security/*``:

* ``GET /api/security/audit`` — a cursor-paginated, filtered page of security events.
* ``GET /api/security/audit/verify`` — ``{checked, ok}`` over the HMAC chain.

Both are OWNER-ONLY. Both fail CLOSED on a malformed request: an unknown filter key, an
out-of-range limit, an unparseable time bound, or an expired cursor is refused, never
ignored. Ignoring a filter is the dangerous direction — it returns more than was asked
for while looking like it worked.

These two replaced ``GET /api/sel/events`` and ``GET /api/sel/verify``. There is one
audit log and now one way to read it (AGENTS.md: "There is one audit log — never a
second"); ``POST /api/sel/rotate`` is a write path with a different risk profile and is
unchanged.

    and the same escalation shape the token-minting route already refuses ("apps may not
    mint tokens", ``handlers/apps.py``): an app would learn what its neighbours did.

    The app-permission middleware alone is not enough here — it is an allowlist, so an app
    that merely DECLARES ``/api/security`` would pass it. This is the categorical refusal.
    Measured before adding it: no app ships declaring ``/api/sel`` or ``/api/security``
    (the native bundles declare no ``api`` scope at all, and the two first-party apps
    declare unrelated prefixes), so the refusal denies nothing that works today.

    The refusal is SEL-logged, matching the app-permission middleware's own deny path.
    Successful reads are not logged: this repo audits mutations only
    (``sel_audit_middleware``), and a read that appends to the log it just read would
    grow the log on every page view and show up in its own results.
