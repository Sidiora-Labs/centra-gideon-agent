GET /api/evals/studies               one row per pre-registered study

one would hold a request open for minutes and spend real money on a click. So the RUN is
`gideon judge-bench` — a deliberate, previewable invocation with its own spend
preflight — and this route publishes what it produced. That is also §6's posture verbatim:
the harness recommends, the human rebinds on the existing Models panel.

404 when nothing has run, with a distinct code from "evals disabled": "no benchmark yet"
and "the feature is off" send a user to two different places, and one code for both would
make the panel's empty state a guess.
