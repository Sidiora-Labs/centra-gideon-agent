"""Evals routes — the judge tier-recommendation table (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §6 / ES-4).

GET /api/evals/judge-bench   the newest benchmark run's table + recommendations

**Read-only on purpose.** The full shipped matrix is 540 judge calls; a POST that started
one would hold a request open for minutes and spend real money on a click. So the RUN is
`gideon judge-bench` — a deliberate, previewable invocation with its own spend
preflight — and this route publishes what it produced. That is also §6's posture verbatim:
the harness recommends, the human rebinds on the existing Models panel.

404 when nothing has run, with a distinct code from "evals disabled": "no benchmark yet"
and "the feature is off" send a user to two different places, and one code for both would
make the panel's empty state a guess.
