"""Unified Trigger API — /api/triggers/*.

A **Trigger** is "when something happens, run an action". Two kinds share one
surface:

- ``schedule`` — a clock tick fires (every / cron / at). Backed by
  :class:`gideon.schedule.ScheduleService` (``state.crons``).
- ``lifecycle`` — an agent-loop event fires (PreToolUse, Stop, …). Backed by
  :class:`gideon.hooks.ScriptHookStore`.

This handler is a **facade**: there is no ``triggers.json`` and no migration. It
presents both stores through one ``Trigger`` shape and routes each mutation to the
owning store by a namespaced id (``schedule:<rawId>`` / ``lifecycle:<rawId>``).

Every trigger carries ``action: {provider, config}`` chosen from the action
provider catalog (``/api/action-providers``). For lifecycle triggers the action
is the hook's ``provider`` + ``provider_config``; for schedule triggers it is
``ScheduleJob.action`` — the sole source of what the job runs. The schedule
executor dispatches every provider straight from that action (``invoke-agent``
runs an LLM turn, every other provider runs through the action registry).

    already work — they were simply reading a store nothing wrote to on this path.

    Tagged `trigger="manual"`, not the autonomous exit type, for two behaviours the run store
    already depends on: `ScheduleRunStore.count_since` excludes `manual` rows from the hourly cap (a
    person clicking Run is not the machine running away), and `autopause.consecutive_failures_from`
    treats a `manual` exit as transparent — so testing a broken automation by hand can neither

    — this records the run HISTORY the manual path was missing, never the fire ALLOWANCE it
    correctly skips. `Trigger.run_count` is the `max_fires` fire-budget meter
    (`service._budget_remaining` reads it, written only at the autonomous fire-GRANT in
    `service.tick`), and `tools.MANUAL_NEVER_BYPASSES` pins `budget` among the gates a manual fire
    never spends — the same reason `_run_event` skips `record_fire` and `count_since` excludes
    manual rows. Spending the budget from a Run button would let a user lock themselves out of their
    own automation by testing it. Likewise a manual run must not drive `state`/`health`/`enabled`: a
    hand-run of a healthy trigger that fails once is not the machine deciding to autopause itself.

    Never raises: a bookkeeping failure must not turn a completed manual run into a crashed request,
    the same contract `_record_fire_outcome` holds. Losing a run record is recoverable; losing the

    """POST /api/triggers/view/render — the `view` kind's production render caller (WF2AUT-6).

    🔴 THE WIRING THIS CLOSES. `pull_on_view` ships a complete `view`-kind runtime — TTL decide,
    freshness sidecar, render fan-out — whose ONLY caller was its own tests, so `surface_binding`
    was set by authors and read by nothing: a `view` trigger could never actually fire. A real
    render surface (an artifact opening, a dashboard tile mounting) POSTs `{surface}` here as it
    renders; every bound `view` trigger past its TTL refreshes, the rest serve cache.

    It is NOT a poll. §3/R10: a `view` trigger must cost nothing when nobody is looking, so the
    runtime is a function a RENDER calls — a background loop would reintroduce the 1440-run-dirs-a-
    day cost the kind exists to avoid. The `pull_on_view` import is function-local for exactly that
    reason: the gateway module must never import it as a loop (the `test_triggers_chain` runtime map
    and `test_NO_background_loop_polls_this_kind` guard depend on it).

    FIRE-AND-FORGET. A synchronous HTTP render must never block on an LLM turn, so each refresh is
    scheduled on the event loop and the decision (what refreshed, what served cache) returns
    immediately — the same background-task idiom the webhook-agent and MCP-probe handlers use.

    A surface with no bound `view` triggers is a 200 with empty lists, not an error: most renders in
    the product bind no trigger, and a 4xx there would make every artifact-open log a failure.
