"""Unified Trigger API — /api/triggers/*.

A **Trigger** is "when something happens, run an action". Two kinds share one
surface:

- ``schedule`` — a clock tick fires (every / cron / at). Backed by
  :class:`gideon.schedule.ScheduleService` (``state.crons``).
- ``lifecycle`` — an agent-loop event fires (PreToolUse, Stop, …). Backed by
  :class:`gideon.hooks.ScriptHookStore`.

This handler is a **facade**: there is no ``triggers.json`` and no migration. It
presents both stores through one ``Trigger`` shape and routes each mutation to the
owning store by a namespaced id (``schedule:<rawId>`` / ``lifecycle:<rawId>``).

Every trigger carries ``action: {provider, config}`` chosen from the action
provider catalog (``/api/action-providers``). For lifecycle triggers the action
is the hook's ``provider`` + ``provider_config``; for schedule triggers it is
``ScheduleJob.action`` — the sole source of what the job runs. The schedule
executor dispatches every provider straight from that action (``invoke-agent``
runs an LLM turn, every other provider runs through the action registry).
