"""Pack dashboard routes (AGENT-PACKS §3.4/§4/§9, AP-3 + AP-4).

The read + re-run surface behind the installed-pack ledger:

* ``GET /api/packs/installed`` — the durable ledger (:mod:`packs.installed`): each installed
  pack, its components, its connector resolutions + ``connector_missing:<name>`` markers, and
  whether a re-runnable setup interview is pending.
* ``POST /api/packs/{name}/finish-setup`` — the "Finish setup" chip's backend (§3.4). A
  pack's ``setup/SKILL.md`` is a normal skill; "finishing setup" is invoking it. This route
  confirms the pack has a setup skill and returns its committed id + the chat slash-command
  the FE opens — it never runs the skill server-side (the interview runs under normal tool
  approval in a chat), and it is re-runnable (the ledger keeps ``setup_pending`` true).

AP-4 adds the four pack KINDS' entry points, each one thin over a core function:

* ``GET /api/packs/bundled`` / ``POST /api/packs/bundled/{name}/install`` — the two shipped
  Domain OS packs (§4.1), built from their authored source tree and imported through §3.
* ``POST /api/packs/{name}/roster/deploy`` — one-click team deploy (§4.2). Deploys the
  ``always`` tier ONLY; the response names the dormant tiers so the caller can show what was
  deliberately not hired.
* ``POST /api/packs/{name}/bindings`` — record one setup-interview answer (§3.4/§4.1). A
  ``folder`` binding must be an existing directory.
* ``POST /api/packs/prompt-card`` — the prompt-card importer (§4.3). Files a proposal for
  review; writes no entity.
* ``POST /api/packs/one-link`` — import a one-link JSON document (§2.3/§4.4) through the same
  §3 pipeline.

AP-7 adds the discovery + maintenance half:

* ``GET /api/packs/proposals`` — the propose-only fingerprint cards (§7). An ON-DEMAND scan
  ("Suggest packs"); it writes nothing, and it is one of only two callers of
  :func:`packs.fingerprint.scan_project` (the other is project-create).
* ``POST /api/packs/proposals/reject`` — remember a "no" per (project, pack), forever.
* ``POST /api/packs/{name}/update`` — the §1 ``pack_owned`` update flow. DRY-RUN by default:
  it returns which components would be overwritten and which are skipped, with the drift note
  for each user-edited copy. ``confirm: true`` applies it.

Kept deliberately thin: every route is a few lines over a core function. Errors use the shared
envelope (``{"error": {"code", "message"}}``) so a caller branches on a stable code.
