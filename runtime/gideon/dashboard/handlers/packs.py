"""Pack dashboard routes (AGENT-PACKS §3.4/§9, AP-3).

The read + re-run surface behind the installed-pack ledger:

* ``GET /api/packs/installed`` — the durable ledger (:mod:`packs.installed`): each installed
  pack, its components, its connector resolutions + ``connector_missing:<name>`` markers, and
  whether a re-runnable setup interview is pending.
* ``POST /api/packs/{name}/finish-setup`` — the "Finish setup" chip's backend (§3.4). A
  pack's ``setup/SKILL.md`` is a normal skill; "finishing setup" is invoking it. This route
  confirms the pack has a setup skill and returns its committed id + the chat slash-command
  the FE opens — it never runs the skill server-side (the interview runs under normal tool
  approval in a chat), and it is re-runnable (the ledger keeps ``setup_pending`` true).

Kept deliberately thin: the pack export/import UI + store cards are AP-7. AP-3 wires only
the ledger reader and the re-run affordance the setup-skill done_when requires.
