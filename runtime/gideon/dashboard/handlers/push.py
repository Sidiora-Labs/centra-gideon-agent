"""Push subscription routes — MOBILE-COMPANION `MC-5` (S3 T3.2).

Three routes, all owner-authenticated by the ordinary middleware (nothing here is added to
``_BYPASS_PREFIXES`` — a subscription endpoint reachable without a session would let anyone
who can reach the gateway register a destination for its pings):

* ``GET  /api/push`` — what the browser needs to subscribe (the VAPID public key) and what
  is already subscribed. Never returns the private key; :func:`gideon.push.push_status`
  is the only shape this route serves.
* ``POST /api/push/subscribe`` — store one W3C ``PushSubscription`` per device id, AND route
  ``approval/requested`` to the ``push`` target for a user who has never set that rule (see
  :func:`gideon.notification_rules.ensure_target` — this is why the phone's "Turn on
  push" is one switch rather than two).
* ``POST /api/push/unsubscribe`` — drop it.

The device id names a BROWSER PROFILE, not a paired device, and is minted client-side
(``web/src/app/pushClient.ts``). That is not laziness: a push subscription belongs to a
browser instance, so one phone running both the installed PWA and Safari holds two
subscriptions and a single paired-device id could not name them apart. It is not a
credential either — the session cookie authenticates this call; the id only says which row
to replace when a browser re-subscribes.
