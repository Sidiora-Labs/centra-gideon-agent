"""Settings → External Access — the inbound seam's operator surface (EA-1, §1.5).

Read-mostly. The panel needs four things and this module is careful about which of
them it will hand back:

* **Per-surface state** — enabled, whether a valid token exists, and remote posture.
  Whether a token EXISTS is reported; the token itself never is. `token_problem`
  already returns a reason rather than a bool, so "why is this surface off?" is
  answerable without the credential ever entering a response body.
* **Per-client records** — labels and bindings, with the token *hash* elided too.
  A hash is not a credential, but publishing it over HTTP hands an offline
  guesser the exact target it needs, for no operator benefit.
* **Derived activity** — last-seen and request counts computed FROM
  `inbound_audit.jsonl`, not from a second counter kept beside it. The guardrails
  health-view pattern: a count maintained alongside a table is two things that can
  disagree, and the table is the one that is true.
* **Kill switches** — flipped through the existing `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH path,
  NOT here. `public_url`, `allow_remote` and the tokens are deliberately unreachable
  from any write path on this surface.
