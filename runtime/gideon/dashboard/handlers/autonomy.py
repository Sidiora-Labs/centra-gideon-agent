"""The earned-autonomy ladder over HTTP (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §6.1).

Four endpoints, and the asymmetry between them IS the safety property:

``GET  /api/autonomy``          the inventory + the derived proposals (reads only)
``POST /api/autonomy/grant``    the click that promotes ONE type by ONE step
``POST /api/autonomy/demote``   give a type's autonomy back (always allowed)
``POST /api/autonomy/undo``     reverse one automatic action AND demote its type

**Promotion is a click and nothing else.** The GET reports that a type has earned its next
rung; only this POST grants it, and the decision belongs to
:func:`~gideon.guardrails.autonomy.grant_rung` — registration, ladder membership, the
declared ceiling, the demotion cooldown and "is this actually an increase" are its checks,
called, not re-implemented here. A client-supplied rung is therefore never trusted: it is
an ASK that ``grant_rung`` validates and can refuse, and the refusal is explained by
``ladder.explain_refused_grant`` AFTER the fact rather than by a second gate that could
drift from the first.

The evidence string stored on the grant is the SERVER's derived record, never text from the
body: an audit row is worth exactly as much as its provenance.

**Demotion needs no confirmation and undo needs no rung.** Both only ever reduce autonomy,
so they are the safe direction — the same reasoning that lets ``POST /api/incident``
activate without a confirm while resuming requires one.
