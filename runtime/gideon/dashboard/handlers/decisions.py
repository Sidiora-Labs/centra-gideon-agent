"""The Decision Journal over HTTP (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §2.5, §5.3) — PA-6.

**ONE endpoint, and that is the design:**

``GET /api/knowledge/decisions?status=&domain=``  the journal AND its calibration strip.

Two routes would have been the obvious shape and it is the wrong one. The strip is an
aggregate *of the rows beside it*, so serving them separately lets a client render a list
of 11 resolved decisions next to a strip computed from 10 — two answers to one question,
from two fetches that raced. One payload makes that unrepresentable.

**Nothing here computes a rate.** :func:`gideon.decisions.calibration` is the only
thing in the codebase that turns decision rows into confidence-vs-outcome numbers, and
:func:`gideon.decisions.list_decisions` is the only thing that flattens an item into a
projection. This module *forwards* both. A second aggregate — here, or in TypeScript over
the raw rows — would be a second definition of how well-calibrated the user is, and the
first time the two disagreed there would be no way to say which was right.

**``count_honest`` is forwarded, never resolved into a rate.** Below ``min_n`` the surface
must say "too few to mean much" rather than draw a mean off three points; the FE decides the
words, but the *fact* comes from here, so the threshold has one spelling. This is the
``optimize.SCORE_UNSCORED`` / ``learningMeta.evidenceLabel`` rule (an unmeasured value
renders as ``unscored`` / ``ungraded``, never as ``0.0`` or a substituted grade) applied to a
claim about the user's own judgement, where a fabricated rate is at its most corrosive.

**The vocabularies ride the payload.** ``statuses``/``domains``/``grades`` are sent rather
than re-spelled in the client, because :mod:`gideon.decisions` refuses a value outside
them — a client with its own copy would offer a filter the server rejects.

Every failure leaves through :func:`~gideon.http_errors.json_error`, the ONE structured
wire envelope `AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" declares (the flat ``{"error": …}`` shape is a
ratcheted, shrinking population — ``tests/test_wire_error_envelope_census.py``).
