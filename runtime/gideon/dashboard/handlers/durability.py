"""Durability endpoints: snapshots, schedule status, on-demand jobs (§3).

Read and run — this session does NOT expose restore over HTTP. Replace-restore
refuses to run while the gateway is up (`snapshot.py:_is_gateway_running`), so a
useful restore endpoint needs the staged-swap-on-next-boot machinery the plan
describes, and half of that is worse than none: an endpoint that appears to restore
and doesn't is a trap. Restore stays `gideon restore` until that lands.
