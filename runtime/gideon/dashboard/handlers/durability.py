"""Durability endpoints: snapshots, schedule status, on-demand jobs (§3).

Read and run — this session does NOT expose restore over HTTP. Replace-restore
refuses to run while the gateway is up (`snapshot.py:_is_gateway_running`), so a
useful restore endpoint needs the staged-swap-on-next-boot machinery the plan
describes, and half of that is worse than none: an endpoint that appears to restore
and doesn't is a trap. Restore stays `gideon restore` until that lands.

    🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. T2-M3 names it and it was absent: the API had `status`, `snapshots`
    and `run`, so a user could take a backup from the dashboard and could not restore one.
    Backup without restore
    is the shape this plan exists to remove ("recoverable through first-class restore endpoints
    — not
    archaeology").

    **Omitting `mode` returns the PLAN and changes nothing.** That is the safe default for an
    endpoint that can overwrite a home: a caller must see what would happen and then ask again
    with an explicit
    mode. `mode=replace` is therefore always deliberate, never inferred.

    Refuses while the gateway runs, exactly as the CLI does — this handler IS the gateway, so a
    restore under it would rewrite state the running process holds open. There is no `--force`
    mirror on purpose: forcing is a local operator decision at a terminal, not something to
    expose over HTTP.
