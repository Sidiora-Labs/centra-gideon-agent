"""HTTP API for onboarding import — ``/api/onboarding/import`` (PEP-5).

The onboarding step's two calls, and nothing else.

``GET``
    Scan every registered source and answer what could be adopted, per source and
    per category. Read-only in both directions: it never writes to the foreign
    root, and it never writes to our home. Items this importer has ALREADY written
    come back ``existing: true``, which is what lets a re-entered first run offer
    nothing twice.

``POST``
    Re-scan, import the user's picks, and answer the per-item outcome report.

**The POST re-scans; it never accepts items from the client.** An
:class:`~gideon.onboarding_import.ImportItem` carries a filesystem ``path``
(skills) and a file body, so honouring a client-supplied one would let any caller
name any directory and have it copied into the home. The wire therefore carries
only the two SELECTION axes — source names and category names — and both are
validated against their closed registries before a single byte is read.

**Nothing is swallowed.** ``conflict`` and ``rejected`` are ordinary rows of the
report the step renders, so a destination that already held something different is
*shown*, not hidden behind a success count. A writer that raises outright (an
unreadable destination, a full disk) answers ``500 onboarding_import_failed``
carrying the failure's own sentence rather than an empty 200. Retrying after either
is safe: the fingerprint ledger records each write as it lands, so whatever already
arrived comes back as ``existing``.

The scan and the import both do synchronous filesystem work, so both run through
:func:`asyncio.to_thread` — a first-run directory walk must not stall the gateway's
event loop.
