"""Usage read routes — the per-turn ledger (CATO-5) plus the per-day spend fold (MRT-3).

Three read-only GETs, deliberately in ONE module because they answer one user question ("what did
this cost me?") at different grains, and a second usage handler module would split that answer:

* ``/api/usage/rollup`` + ``/api/usage/totals`` (CATO-5) — the per-TURN ledger
  (``usage_ledger``), filterable by session and an arbitrary ``[since, until)`` window. The
  session/turn-grain forensic view.
* ``/api/usage`` (MRT-3) — the per-DAY durable fold (``routing/usage.py``) over BOTH recorded
  stores: the ledger's streamed turns AND ``model_calls.jsonl``'s guarded ``complete()`` attempts,
  which the two routes above cannot see at all (the ledger has no row for them, so the entire
  unattended axis was invisible spend). Grouped by model / provider / purpose under the single
  ``interactive|background|loop|eval|app`` vocabulary.

The overlap is intentional and bounded: the fold is the long-horizon record (both JSONLs are
capped), the rollup is the recent per-session detail. Neither derives from the other, and only the
fold claims to cover both axes.

Read-only throughout — this is observation, never enforcement, so there is no write/mutate route
here. Errors use the shared ``{error:{code,message}}`` envelope
(:func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error`).
