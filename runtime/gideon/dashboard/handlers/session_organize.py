"""Suggested-organization endpoints (SESSION-MANAGEMENT T2.1).

Three routes over :mod:`gideon.session_organize`: read a suggestion, accept it,
decline it. The GET is the chip's data source and is strictly read-only — a user who
opens a chat and never touches the chip leaves the session exactly as it was.

Uses the `AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" error envelope
(``{"error": {"code", "message"}}``), emitted by
:func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error`.
