"""Desktop shell seam — the gateway routes behind the capability bridge (DC-2 C2/C3).

Four write routes for the Electron MAIN process (loopback + a credential) and two
read routes for the dashboard and for apps holding a ``desktop`` permission. The
registry itself, and the reasoning behind the ``shell_token``, live in
:mod:`gideon.dashboard.desktop_registry`.

Every rejection here does two things, always in this order: emit a SEL row, then
return 403 with a body that names the *class* of failure and never echoes a
presented credential (an error body is the easiest place to leak a token into a
screenshot or a bug report). ``operation`` values are stable strings so the
Security surface can be filtered on them:

* ``desktop.register`` — mint a session token (needs ``X-Local-Secret``)
* ``desktop.state.push`` — refresh the manifest (needs ``X-Shell-Token``)
* ``desktop.unregister`` — shell going away (needs ``X-Shell-Token``)
* ``desktop.capability_denied`` — an app read a capability it did not declare

Loopback is checked BEFORE the credential on every write route. A remote caller
must not be able to distinguish a wrong token from a right one, and must not be
able to use these routes as a token oracle at all.
