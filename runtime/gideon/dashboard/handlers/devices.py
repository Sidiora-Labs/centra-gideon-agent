"""Device pairing + the Devices registry (COMPANION-APPS C2 / T1.1).

Four routes, one credential type:

* ``POST /api/devices/pair/start``     — owner-authenticated; mints a code + QR payload
* ``POST /api/devices/pair/complete``  — auth-EXEMPT; the device redeems the code for a session
* ``GET  /api/devices``                — owner-authenticated; the registry
* ``POST /api/devices/{id}/revoke``    — owner-authenticated; locks one device out

**There is no device token.** A paired device gets an ordinary session cookie from the same
:func:`generate_token` the owner's browser uses; pairing only writes provenance
(``issuer="pair"`` plus a ``device`` block) onto the session row it just minted. That is the
load-bearing decision: a second credential type would need its own expiry, its own revocation
list, its own middleware branch and its own bugs, and the first time the two disagreed the
device would be authenticated by one and unknown to the other. The registry is therefore a
VIEW over `sessions.json`, which is why "revoke" and "the session is gone" cannot drift apart
— they are the same write.

``pair/complete`` is exempt from token auth for exactly the reason ``/api/auth/login`` and
``/api/auth/enroll/complete`` are: the caller has no session yet, and gating the route behind
the session it exists to mint would be circular. It carries the same compensating guards —
origin check, per-IP lockout, single-use hashed code with a short TTL — and it shares the
lockout counters and the cookie writer with the login path rather than reimplementing them,
because two cookie writers means two security postures for one session model.

Every route emits a SEL event, INCLUDING the denials. A rejected pairing attempt is the event
an owner most wants to see afterwards; a rejection that leaves no trace is indistinguishable
from an attempt that never happened.

    fetch the SPA makes on boot would 403 before a single field rendered. The `pairing_url` the
    panel hands out was a dead end in both states without this — 403 without a token, and with
    one the SPA's hash router simply landed on the dashboard.
