"""Share one chat as a redacted, read-only artifact (SESSION-MANAGEMENT SM-9 / T3.3).

T3.3 asked for two halves — "Markdown/JSON export (redacted) **+ optional read-only
shared artifact (never auto-published)**". Only export shipped (see the plan's execution
log, headed "T3.3 — export."), while `docs/roadmap/atomic/SM.md`'s SM-8 evidence line
already claimed the share half existed. This module is that half.

**"Share" here means inside the owner's own instance.** It creates an artifact in the
owner's artifact library on an explicit authenticated request. It does NOT publish
anything: no public URL, no share token, no unauthenticated route. Exposing a conversation
outside the machine belongs to EXTERNAL-ACCESS and is the owner's decision, not a
side effect of a "Share" menu item.

Three properties, and what makes each true rather than claimed:

**Redacted** — the body is :func:`session_export.render_markdown`'s output verbatim, not a
second rendering. That function re-runs both redaction passes over EVERY role because the
dashboard write path deliberately skips ``user``/``system`` (see its module docstring), so
the shared artifact inherits the only redaction those roles ever get. A test asserts the
artifact body is byte-identical to the export, which is what keeps the two from drifting
into "the export is redacted, the share is nearly redacted".

**Read-only** — the artifact is created with ``readonly=True``, and
``NativeArtifactProvider``'s three content-mutating methods refuse a readonly artifact at
the STORE (not the route), so the MCP tools and workflow actions cannot edit it either.
That is what stops the transcript round-tripping back into a session: an edited copy of a
redacted transcript is neither the conversation that happened nor a redacted export of it,
and there is no path that turns an artifact back into chat history.

**Never auto-published** — :func:`share_session` is called from exactly one place, the
explicit ``POST /api/chat/sessions/{session}/share`` handler. No heartbeat tick, no
post-turn hook, no "share on archive" convenience. ``tests/test_session_share.py`` proves
it with an AST census of every call site in ``src/gideon``, in the style of SM-5's
"never auto-applies" sweep; a future caller that "just shares it while we're here" reds
that test instead of quietly publishing conversations.
