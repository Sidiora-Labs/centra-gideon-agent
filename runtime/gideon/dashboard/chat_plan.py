"""Chat plan mode — a chat bound to the EXISTING planning walkthrough (CC-8).

There is deliberately **no second state machine** here. The walkthrough state is
``gideon.planning.session``: the same ``PlanSession``/``PlanStep`` model and the
same ``submit_artifact`` → ``edit_artifact`` → ``comment_step``/``approve_step``
transitions that the loop planning surface (``handlers/loop_routes.py``) drives. This
module only does the two things that model deliberately leaves to its owner:

  * **persists** that session for a CHAT owner instead of a loop owner
    (``PlanSession.project_id`` carries the chat session key), and
  * records the chat-side **attachment** — which task mode to restore once the plan is
    approved, and whether activation happened mid-turn and therefore parked a run.
    That is turn bookkeeping, not plan state.

Two properties are load-bearing:

**Activation is manual only.** Nothing on the send path calls into this module to
*create* a session; ``activate`` is reachable only from the composer affordance's
endpoint. The turn-end hook (``maybe_submit_plan_draft``) is a no-op for a chat with no
session, so a quick task is untouched — no heuristic, no auto-detection.

**The no-execute guarantee is the task-mode gate, not a prompt.** Activation flips the
session to task mode ``plan``; the canonical gate in ``gideon.task_modes`` (which
the native runtime consults in ``_guard_and_invoke`` *before* approval) is what denies a
mutating tool. This module never writes a "don't execute" instruction anywhere — it only
sets the posture the existing gate reads, and refuses to *leave* that posture while a
step is still awaiting review.

Storage: ``config_dir()/chat_plans/<safe key>.json``, atomic writes, reads tolerate a
missing/corrupt file. This is a user-facing availability surface (the walkthrough panel),
so a corrupt file **fails open** to "no plan session" + a warning rather than wedging the
chat behind an unreadable gate.
