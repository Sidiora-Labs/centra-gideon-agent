"""Durable signing key + session records (REMOTE-USER-AUTH S1).

Before this, `token_auth._SECRET = os.urandom(32)` ran at module scope and the valid-nonce
set lived in memory. Both consequences were the same: **every gateway restart invalidated
every token.** On a local box that means re-running `gideon token` after each restart;
off-network it means you cannot get back in at all, because minting a fresh URL requires
being on the machine. That is the concrete pain this fixes.

Two pieces of state, deliberately separate files:

* **the signing key** (`session_key`) — 32 random bytes, 0600. Rotating it invalidates
  everything at once, which is exactly what you want from a panic button and exactly what
  you do NOT want to happen accidentally on reboot.
* **the session records** (`sessions.json`) — one entry per minted nonce with its expiry,
  so a token minted before a restart still verifies afterwards.

**Row shape (COMPANION-APPS C1).** A row is a RECORD, not a bare expiry:
``{"exp": float, "issuer": str, "device": {...}}``. The extra two fields are what make a
device registry possible without a second credential type — a paired phone holds an ordinary
session, and the only thing that distinguishes it from the owner's browser is provenance
written down at mint time. Without ``issuer`` the registry cannot tell a phone from a laptop,
and "revoke this device" degrades into "log everyone out".

:func:`load_sessions` remains the ``{nonce: exp}`` PROJECTION of that one shape — it is the
only thing the token middleware needs, and narrowing there keeps the hot path from carrying a
registry it never reads. One stored shape, two typed views; not two paths.

**An old-shape file (a bare float per row) is DISCARDED, not upgraded.** Deliberate, and the
reason is not laziness about a three-line branch: a row with no ``issuer`` is a live session
the registry can neither describe nor revoke, which is precisely the audit gap this record
exists to close. Admitting one would mean shipping a device list that is silently incomplete.
The cost of discarding is bounded and already documented by the pre-1.0 banner — one
``gideon token`` re-mint, which is exactly the pre-S1 behavior this store replaced.

**Why a file and not the credential store:** the key must be readable during middleware
setup, before any provider or keychain prompt can run, and on a headless box there may be no
keychain at all. A 0600 file in the config dir is the same trust level as
`.local_secret`, which already guards the same surface.

**Failure posture is FAIL-CLOSED, unlike most of this codebase.** If the key cannot be read
or written, `load_or_create_key()` raises rather than falling back to an ephemeral key.
A silent fallback would look identical to working — until the next restart logged everyone
out again, which is the bug being fixed. An auth surface that cannot persist its trust root
should refuse to pretend otherwise.
