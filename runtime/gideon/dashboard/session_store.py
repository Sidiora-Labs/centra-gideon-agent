"""Durable signing key + session records (REMOTE-USER-AUTH S1).

Before this, `token_auth._SECRET = os.urandom(32)` ran at module scope and the valid-nonce
set lived in memory. Both consequences were the same: **every gateway restart invalidated
every token.** On a local box that means re-running `gideon token` after each restart;
off-network it means you cannot get back in at all, because minting a fresh URL requires
being on the machine. That is the concrete pain this fixes.

Two pieces of state, deliberately separate files:

* **the signing key** (`session_key`) — 32 random bytes, 0600. Rotating it invalidates
  everything at once, which is exactly what you want from a panic button and exactly what
  you do NOT want to happen accidentally on reboot.
* **the session records** (`sessions.json`) — one entry per minted nonce with its expiry,
  so a token minted before a restart still verifies afterwards.

**Why a file and not the credential store:** the key must be readable during middleware
setup, before any provider or keychain prompt can run, and on a headless box there may be no
keychain at all. A 0600 file in the config dir is the same trust level as
`.local_secret`, which already guards the same surface.

**Failure posture is FAIL-CLOSED, unlike most of this codebase.** If the key cannot be read
or written, `load_or_create_key()` raises rather than falling back to an ephemeral key.
A silent fallback would look identical to working — until the next restart logged everyone
out again, which is the bug being fixed. An auth surface that cannot persist its trust root
should refuse to pretend otherwise.
