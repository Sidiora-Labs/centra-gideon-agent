"""Conversation-turn rollback — `/undo N` (power-user-surfaces P7).

Rolls the conversation back N turns: removes the last N user→assistant turns from
the session's message history (in-memory AND persisted transcript), returning to an
earlier state. Distinct from memory-event undo (which reverts a learned *fact*, not
the *conversation*).

Bound (honest-status discipline): this undoes the CONVERSATION only. Side effects the
undone turns already took (files written, tasks created, tools run) are NOT reversed —
the response says so. Reversing side effects is a much larger transactional-agent
problem, explicitly out of scope.
