"""Is this instance internet-exposed? (REMOTE-USER-AUTH T4.1)

**One signal, two surfaces.** The plan's own coordination note with EXTERNAL-ACCESS says there
is one "this instance is internet-exposed" signal serving two surfaces (the human dashboard and
the inbound API). This module is that one signal, so `Secure`-cookie, CSP and forwarded-header
decisions cannot drift apart from each other or from the inbound surface's own boundary.

**Why not reuse `dashboard.url`.** It already exists, but it means "a URL to put in links we
send to Slack", and people legitimately set it to a LAN address or an `http://` host. Deriving
`Secure` from that would set a flag that makes the cookie undeliverable over plain http — the
user would be silently unable to log in, with nothing pointing at the cause. Exposure has to be
its own deliberate statement.

**Trusted proxies are the load-bearing part.** `X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-For` are
attacker-controlled unless the peer that set them is one you named. Trusting them by shape
("looks like a private address") is the classic mistake: any container neighbour, any LAN
device, any SSRF-able local service is on a private address.
