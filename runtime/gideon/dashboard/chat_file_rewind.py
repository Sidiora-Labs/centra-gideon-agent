"""Filesystem rewind — ``/rewind-to-turn N`` (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §6).

**Naming, because "rewind" is already taken.** ``chat_regenerate``'s ``rewind: true``
(edit-resend, CHAT-CRAFT S1) rewinds the TRANSCRIPT. This module rewinds the FILES and
nothing else — hence ``chat_file_rewind``. The two never share state.

The deliberate other half of :mod:`gideon.dashboard.chat_undo`. ``/undo`` rolls back
the CONVERSATION and says in its own response that files written were not reverted; this
rolls back the FILES and does not touch the transcript. Keeping them separate is the point:
the transcript is the record of what happened, and a rewind that erased it would destroy the
evidence a user needs to decide whether the rewind was right.

Two routes, because a destructive action needs a readable preview before anything is written:

* ``GET  /api/chat/sessions/{session}/rewind?turn=N`` — read-only preview: exactly which
  files would be restored, deleted, or (honestly) *not* restored because they were never
  captured, with a unified diff per file and current-vs-restored hashes.
* ``POST /api/chat/sessions/{session}/rewind {turn, confirm: true}`` — apply. Without
  ``confirm: true`` this returns ``409 confirmation_required`` **and the preview**, so a
  client that forgets the flag gets the preview rather than a surprise write.
