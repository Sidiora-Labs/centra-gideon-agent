"""Async bundled-model downloads with live progress (the model-fetch job runner).

Bundled model providers (embedding / STT / TTS) fetch their weights from
HuggingFace, which can take minutes. A synchronous download route would hold the
request open for the whole fetch and give the UI no progress. This module turns
each download into a background **job** that streams progress over the SSE
substrate (``dashboard/sse.py``):

- :class:`ModelDownloadJob` — one in-flight or finished download (``kind``,
  ``model``, ``status``, ``phase``, bytes-on-disk vs expected size).
- :class:`ModelDownloadRegistry` — owns the jobs, dedupes by ``(kind, model)``,
  runs the blocking fetch off the event loop, and polls bytes-on-disk to publish
  ``progress`` frames on a per-job hub keyed ``download:<id>``.

Progress is **best-effort by on-disk growth**, not HuggingFace's internal tqdm:
a job snapshots the size of the kind's cache root at start and reports the delta
as it grows. No coupling to ``hf_hub`` internals; the trade-off is that two
concurrent downloads of the *same kind* would share a baseline (rare — jobs
dedupe per model, and the UI downloads one at a time). The expected total
(``size_mb`` from each provider's catalog) lets the client render a determinate
bar; without it the client falls back to indeterminate.

Cancellation detaches the job (stops the stream, drops it from the registry).
A HuggingFace fetch already in a worker thread cannot be interrupted cleanly, so
the underlying download may still finish in the background — the job just stops
being tracked.
