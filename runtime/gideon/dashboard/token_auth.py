"""Dashboard token authentication.

HMAC-SHA256 token generation, validation, IP binding, consumption
tracking, and aiohttp middleware for channel-gated dashboard access.

``auth_middleware`` is the primary entry point for callers that have an
``AuthConfig``.  It dispatches by ``AuthMode``:

* ``NONE``        — passes all requests through (loopback enforced by
                    ``effective_bind`` before the server starts).
* ``LOCAL_TOKEN`` — delegates to ``token_auth_middleware``.
* ``API_KEY``     — validates ``Authorization: Bearer <key>`` against
                    ``os.environ[auth_cfg.api_key_env]``.
* ``OAUTH2``      — verifies a bearer JWT via :mod:`gideon.auth.oidc`.

On any authentication failure the middleware returns HTTP 401 with a
JSON body that does NOT echo request headers, cookies, or tokens.
