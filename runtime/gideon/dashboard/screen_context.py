"""Process-global, in-memory screen-frame slot — ONE frame per session, latest-wins.

MULTIMODAL-IO §5.3/§5.4. When a user shares their screen into a chat, the browser
POSTs a single JPEG/PNG frame per turn to ``/api/chat/screen-frame``. That frame is
held HERE — in a bounded dict of process memory — until the next turn drains it, and
then it is gone.

Three properties this module exists to guarantee, each of them load-bearing:

* **Never on disk.** Nothing in this file opens, writes, or names a file, and the
  frame bytes never reach a log record. A screenshot of someone's screen is the most
  intimate payload the platform handles; the only way to be sure it isn't sitting in
  ``~/.gideon`` after the fact is for the code that holds it to have no write
  path at all. Persistence exists only via the user's explicit "Pin frame" action,
  which goes through the ordinary uploads store — a different module, a different
  verb, and a deliberate one.
* **Latest-wins, exactly one.** :func:`stage` REPLACES; it never appends. A slow turn
  followed by three more captures leaves one frame — the newest — so a drain can
  never hand the model a stale view of a screen the user has since navigated away
  from. There is no queue to grow and nothing to flush.
* **One-shot drain.** :func:`drain` POPS. A second drain on the same session returns
  ``None``, so a frame captured for "what's wrong with this diff?" cannot silently
  ride along on the unrelated question that follows it.

Slots die with the process. That is the feature, not a limitation: a gateway restart
is a hard reset of everything the assistant could see.

# ── Delivery routing (§5.3) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Pure policy: given the model a session is bound to, decide HOW a frame can reach
# it. Kept here beside the slot so the route (which tells the UI whether to offer
# the control, and why not) and the chat runner (which actually delivers) share ONE
# implementation of "is this model a vision model?" — two callers deriving that
# separately is how a toggle ends up enabled for a model that then can't read what
# it is sent.
#
# One honest caveat: a shared implementation is not the same as identical answers,
# because the two callers cannot supply the same input. The runner holds the live
# provider and resolves `auto`/empty to the model actually about to serve the turn
# (`chat_runner._bound_model_id`); the route runs before any provider exists and can
# only pass `session.model` as stored. So on an `auto` session the route may report
# DELIVERY_DESCRIBED (or DELIVERY_NONE) where the runner will go DELIVERY_NATIVE.
# The divergence is one-directional and in the safe direction — the UI can only
# under-promise, never promise pixels that don't arrive — and `useScreenShare`
# deliberately does not surface the mode to the user for exactly this reason.

#: A frame rides the turn as a real image content part.

    **Both readings are tried**, because the two forms are not distinguishable:
    model ids legitimately contain colons (``…-v1:0``, ``llava:latest``), so a
    leading ``provider:`` prefix cannot be told apart from the first segment of a
    bare id. Stripping to the post-colon tail — the obvious reading — silently
    misclassifies every bare Ollama-style id, because the tail of ``llava:latest``
    is ``latest``, which declares nothing. Capability inference is substring-based,
    so consulting the whole label as well can only ADD a match, never lose one.

    An empty label or ``"auto"`` returns **False**. That is the conservative answer
