    §9.5 asks that headless CLI turns "ride SpendMeter scope_key=cli". Nothing on the
    chat path bound a run scope at all — ``set_current_run_key`` had exactly one
    production caller (the trigger-fire seam), so every chat turn charged with an empty
    run key and ``run_totals`` for any chat scope was 0.0 by construction.

    Binding happens HERE rather than inside ``run_chat`` because this is a fresh task:
    a ContextVar set in a task dies with it, so the scope cannot leak into the caller's
    context and there is no reset to get wrong in a 2900-line function's teardown. The
    two direct-await callers of ``run_chat`` (the gateway's nudge loop, tests) are
    therefore untouched — they bind no scope, exactly as before.

    An ``inbound:cli:`` session scopes to ``cli``; another ``inbound:`` surface scopes to
    its own surface name, so the HTTP dialects EA-2/EA-5 add are attributable without
    being lumped in with the CLI. A dashboard session binds nothing, keeping every
    interactive turn byte-identical to today.

    every attachment gets. Sending it on to the knowledge library is then the user's
    normal explicit ingest action; nothing here touches knowledge.db or memory.db.

    effort regardless — so the axis existed on the wire for a runtime that had reported it
    does not exist, and the value rode into the session metadata where a later read treats
    it as a real pin. A control the provider cannot honor is worse than a missing one: it
    is a setting the user is told took effect.

        Fail OPEN: refusing a bind we cannot judge would make the picker unusable whenever
        discovery has not warmed, and the format check still applies.
      * ``[]`` → the backend was asked and reported no effort axis. Refuse.
      * a non-empty set → the effort must be one of the backend's own verbatim values.
        This is also why the bind path can no longer use a hardcoded ``low/medium/high/max``
