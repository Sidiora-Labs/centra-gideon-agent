"""In-process registry for chat-attachment content extraction.

When a file is attached in chat it's uploaded to ``~/.gideon/uploads`` and
its extraction (knowledge EXTRACTION graph only — see ``knowledge.extract``)
starts IMMEDIATELY, while the user is still typing. The result is cached by the
saved file path. When the chat turn runs, the runner awaits any pending
extraction for the turn's attached files (so the query blocks on extraction iff
it isn't done yet) and prepends the extracted text to the prompt context.

Singleton, keyed by absolute upload path. Bounded so a long session can't grow
it without bound.
