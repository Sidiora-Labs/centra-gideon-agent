"""Session lifecycle — archive, restore, and the auto-archive rule (SESSION-MANAGEMENT S2).

At 100+ conversations the list becomes a scroll. Archiving is the answer, and it is
deliberately **not** deletion: an archived session keeps its transcript, keeps its
FTS index entry, and can be restored in one action. That is what makes it safe to do
on a timer — the worst case of a wrong auto-archive is one click to undo, not a lost
conversation.

Distinct from two neighbours that already exist and are easy to confuse with it:

* ``history.py``'s 2MB JSONL rotation is **storage**, not a user-facing state.
* ``api_chat_sessions_cleanup`` **evicts** stale sessions from memory (they reload from
  disk on demand). Archiving changes a session's declared lifecycle instead, and never
  drops it from the in-memory map.

The rule is: a session with no user/assistant turn for ``session.auto_archive_days``
days archives, unless it is pinned ``never_archive``. A session whose activity was
never recorded (an old one, or one untouched since the field landed) is treated as
NOT stale — guessing "archive it" from missing data would archive someone's history on
first upgrade.

**Both halves of the session list are swept, not just the resident one.** The chat list
merges in-memory sessions with sessions that exist only as a transcript on disk, and
``dashboard.restore_sessions`` defaults to False — so on a default install a chat that
has been idle for months is precisely the one that is NOT in memory. A sweep over
``state._sessions`` alone therefore skipped exactly the sessions it exists to catch,
while reporting success. Disk-only candidates are read from the conversation log's
metadata and archived by writing the lifecycle back to the transcript's metadata line.
