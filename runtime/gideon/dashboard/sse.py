"""Server-Sent Events substrate — the reusable transport for server→client
state and event streams.

Gideon's realtime doctrine is
**single-transport-per-concern**: per-resource SSE for state/event streams,
WebSocket only for the chat token stream + terminal. This module is the SSE half:
a small hub that fans typed events out to every connected client of a stream.

A :class:`SseHub` owns a set of per-client queues. A producer calls
:meth:`SseHub.publish` with a named event + payload; every subscribed client
receives it. The HTTP handler side is :func:`stream_response`, which drains a
client's queue to the wire as ``event: <name>\\ndata: <payload>\\n\\n`` frames
and emits periodic keepalives.

Hubs are addressable so the same substrate serves every scope:

- a single **global** hub (the dashboard status + notification stream),
- **per-type** hubs (e.g. one for sessions, one for notifications), and
- **per-resource-id** hubs (e.g. ``loop:<id>``) created on demand and
  evicted when their last subscriber disconnects.

:class:`SseRegistry` manages the per-id hubs and their lifecycle.

Wire-format contract: ``publish(event, data)`` writes ``data`` verbatim when it
is already a ``str`` (the producer controls serialization — e.g. a bare
comma-joined ``refresh`` payload or a pre-serialized JSON sessions list), and
``json.dumps(data)`` otherwise. This lets a producer emit an exact byte-for-byte
frame when it needs full control of the wire payload.
