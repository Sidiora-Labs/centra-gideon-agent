"""Chatless tile refresh — the layout/data split, executed (AMBIENT-SURFACES §2.1-§2.4).

A live tile is three things, and the whole cost argument rests on keeping them apart:

* a **skeleton** — an artifact whose body carries ``{{...}}`` binding slots, authored ONCE
  by a model (a chat turn or a workflow stage);
* **data nodes** — the "bound data workflow", whose degenerate and only pre-substrate case
  is a list of action-provider dispatches (§2.1);
* a **render transform** — :func:`render_skeleton`: deterministic, LLM-free interpolation of
  the node outputs into the skeleton, handed to the ``artifact-update`` sink (§2.2).

First generation is creative. Every refresh after it is pure substitution, so a steady-state
refresh costs zero tokens. That is the practitioner finding this implements ("same layout,
new data, no re-prompting") and it is also why the refresh must not be able to reach a model:
the whole cost claim is one accidental `stage` node away from being false.

**Ledger weight, not run weight (§2.3).** A refresh writes ONE
:data:`~gideon.ledger.kinds.TILE_REFRESHED` row and creates no run directory — the
"1440 run dirs a day" critique is structurally avoided rather than mitigated. The row carries
tokens, cost, duration and per-node outcomes, because the tile header renders exactly those
(§2.4) and a second status channel would let the chip and the ledger disagree.

**A failed refresh writes nothing (§2.4).** If any data node fails, the render is skipped and
the artifact keeps its last-good body: the tile stays painted and its chip turns red. Writing
a half-rendered body would replace real content with `{{...}}` literals, which is the silent
empty panel this section exists to prevent.
