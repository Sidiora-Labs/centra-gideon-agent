"""The ONE chokepoint where a client's declared API version is compared.

:mod:`gideon.assurance.api_version` owns the numbers, the window and the comparison;
this module is the aiohttp adapter that runs it once per request and turns a
refusal into the PL-8 wire envelope. There is deliberately no second comparison
site — ``tests/test_api_version_one_origin.py`` asserts that
:func:`gideon.assurance.api_version.negotiate` has exactly one non-test caller,
because a version check duplicated into a handler is how a window quietly stops
applying on half the surface.

**What is exempt, and why.** A version refusal on the wrong route is an outage,
so every exemption below is deliberate. The rule of thumb: never gate anything a
refused client must reach *in order to* stop being refused.

* **Everything outside ``/api/``** — the SPA document, ``/assets/**``,
  ``/login``, icons, fonts. Recovering from a version refusal *is* a page load:
  gating the bundle means a stale client can never fetch the newer bundle that
  would fix it, which converts a legible refusal back into the blank screen this
  atom exists to remove.
* **``GET /api/healthz``** — the liveness probe (``gideon status``, a
  launchd/systemd supervisor, a container health check). A non-200 here reads as
  "the gateway is down", so gating it would turn a client-version problem into a
  false outage and, worse, into an automatic restart loop.
* **``GET /api/manifest``** — the endpoint that PUBLISHES ``apiVersion``.
  Refusing it is circular: it is how a mismatched client learns which number to
  send, and a client that cannot read the manifest cannot discover the window it
  failed.
* **The pre-session front door** (``/api/token/local``, ``/api/logout``,
  ``/api/auth/status``, ``/api/auth/login``, ``/api/auth/enroll/complete``,
  ``/api/devices/pair/complete``) — these authenticate themselves and exist to
  mint the session a client needs before it can do anything else. A version wall
  in front of login turns "reload the page" into "you cannot even authenticate
  far enough to see why you were refused". Exempting them opens nothing: each
  keeps its own loopback/secret/argon2/rate-limit guard.
* **``/mcp``** — the inbound MCP surface negotiates its own protocol version per
  the MCP specification. A second, Gideon-specific version wall in front of
  it would refuse a spec-compliant client over a number it has no way to know.
* **WebSocket upgrades (``/api/ws`` and below)** — a browser ``WebSocket``
  cannot set a request header, so the only carrier would be a query parameter
  appended at every socket site (four of them today), i.e. four declaration
  sites instead of one. Gating them buys no coverage either: a socket is opened
  by an already-mounted SPA that has necessarily made HTTP calls first, so the
  chokepoint has already judged that client.

Everything else under ``/api/`` (plus ``/mcp``, which is inside the gate's scope
so that its exemption above is a live, checkable decision rather than an accident
of path shape) is gated.
