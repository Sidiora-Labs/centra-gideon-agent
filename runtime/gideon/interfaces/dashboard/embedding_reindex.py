"""Embedding re-index jobs with live progress.

Switching the active embedding model invalidates every stored vector — they came
from a different model and live in a different space (often a different
dimension). This module re-indexes both embedding stores as a background job
with SSE progress, mirroring :mod:`gideon.interfaces.dashboard.model_downloads`:

  * **Knowledge** — ``KnowledgeStore`` items and chunks (clear vectors → re-embed
    each from preserved title/summary/content and chunk text).
  * **Episodic memory** — ``SemanticArchive`` episodic rows (clear → re-embed
    from preserved text → rebuild FAISS). Semantic memory embeds lazily at query
    time, so clearing is enough there.

A single job at a time (re-indexing twice concurrently would race the stores);
``start`` returns the running job if one is already in flight. Progress frames
publish on the per-job SSE hub keyed ``reindex:<id>``.

    Sibling of the item-vector re-index above, and deliberately separate from it: the
    re-index rewrites the items' OWN vectors on a model switch, while this only adds the
    chunk layer beneath them for items that predate chunking. Both are needed and neither
    substitutes for the other.

    This is a graph-maintenance pass, not a boot hook (KL-14). The backfill used to run from
    ``app.on_startup``, which fires exactly once: on a gateway that stays up for a week, a
    library that gains pre-chunking items after boot never gained deep-document recall. The
    host (:mod:`gideon.cognition.knowledge.maintenance`) instead calls this on every due tick and
    keeps claiming sub-batches until it returns 0, so the backlog drains across ticks and the
    store lock is released between batches.

    Cheap when there is nothing to do: the backlog is derived from the rows (see
    ``store.count_items_missing_chunks``), so a fully-chunked library costs one COUNT and
    returns 0 — checked BEFORE resolving an embedder, because resolving one probes the
    provider over the network and a no-op pass must not pay for that every tick.

    Faults propagate: the host isolates a failing pass (``fatal=False``) and records it in
    ``MaintenanceResult.errors``, which is strictly more legible than swallowing here. Only
    the deferred cases (empty backlog, no embedding model bound) return 0.
