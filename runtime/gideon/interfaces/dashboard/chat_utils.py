       streamed as an ordinary turn and ``notify`` says so. Covers the measured
       claude-code case (adapter 0.60.0 advertises no command capability) and every

       the capability said yes and the method wasn't there.
    3. **Declared, and ``-32601`` arrives AFTER events have been yielded** → NO

       stops with :class:`AcpCommandFailedAfterOutput`, whose message explains that to the

    ``dashboard/`` routes through it or through ``resolve_history_key`` directly
    (``tests/test_session_key_one_owner_audit.py`` reds on a new bypass).

    Returns the resolved persisted key, falling back to the dashboard-namespaced form
    when nothing is persisted under either candidate — so for a never-yet-saved
