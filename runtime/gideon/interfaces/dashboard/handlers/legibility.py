"""Legibility endpoints — the Discover section + hub's data (Platform-Legibility §6).

``GET /api/legibility/discover`` returns the curated Discover tips still worth showing
(the hand-authored catalog minus dismissed tips and minus areas the user has already
engaged), grouped by area, or ``enabled: false`` when the ``legibility.discover_tips``
kill switch is off. ``POST /api/legibility/discover/dismiss`` persists a per-tip
dismissal so it never resurfaces. Propose-don't-write: neither endpoint ever enables
or configures anything on the user's behalf.

``GET /api/legibility/always-on`` is the always-on conventions viewer's data (PEP-10): every
``always: true`` skill and project-instruction doc a session receives unconditionally, with
provenance. ``GET /api/legibility/always-on/doc`` returns one body verbatim for the editor and
``PUT`` writes it back. The viewer slices the session's own producer strings rather than
re-deriving the always-on set — see ``legibility/always_on.py`` for why, including why a GET
here must not assemble a full session prompt.
