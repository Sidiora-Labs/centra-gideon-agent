"""The gateway route the computer-use shim forwards to (`DCU-4`).

One route, one job: turn an HTTP request from the stdio shim into a call to
:func:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.service.computer_dispatch`, and turn the three refusal
exceptions into one wire envelope. **No decision is made here** — this handler is the second
half of the transport, and a screen implemented at the route would be a screen the dispatch's
other callers do not get.

**Internal-only, and that is registered in one place.** ``/api/computer-use/dispatch`` is in
``server.py``'s ``internal_paths``, so a request must be loopback and carry
``X-Internal-Secret``. The shim gets both from ``mcp_core._post``. It is not in
``mixed_internal_paths``: no browser surface calls it, and widening the auth model of the one
route that can drive the operator's desktop to admit cookie auth would put it behind whatever
the weakest browser path is.

**Why the refusal body carries the AgentError's fields as well as a wire code.** The two
envelopes are deliberately distinct (see :mod:`gideon.http_errors`): the wire ``code`` is
what an HTTP client branches on, and the ``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE`` AgentError code is what an LLM
session branches on. A computer-use refusal has to reach *both* — the model needs the
WHAT/WHY/FIX to recover, and it must be the same three lines the dispatch composed, not a
paraphrase. So they ride inside ``error`` under ``agent_code``/``what``/``why``/``fix``, which
keeps the wire vocabulary disjoint from the agent vocabulary while letting one refusal have one
voice.
