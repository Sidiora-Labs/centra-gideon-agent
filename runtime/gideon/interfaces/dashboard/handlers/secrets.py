"""The secrets vault surface — ``/api/secrets``, presence in, values one-way only (EI-10).

Three routes:

* ``GET    /api/secrets`` — every row the vault knows: global, per-project, and inherit-from-host,
  each with its derived consumer links. **No value, in any row, ever.**
* ``POST   /api/secrets`` — store or replace one secret's value.
* ``DELETE /api/secrets`` — remove one.

🔴 **THE WRITE PATH IS ONE-WAY, AND THAT IS STRUCTURAL.** A value enters through ``POST`` and goes
straight into the credential store. Nothing in this module can read one back:
:mod:`gideon.security.secrets_vault` builds the whole read model from key NAMES
(``credentials.credential_names``), and ``get_credential`` is not imported here or there. So the
response to a ``POST`` that just stored a token is assembled from the same name-only read model as
a ``GET`` — the value the handler was handed one line earlier is not in the object it serialises,
because that object is a :class:`~gideon.security.secrets_vault.SecretPresence` and the type has no
value field. This is deliberately not "redact on the way out": ``redact_credentials`` is not
idempotent over a composed ``field: value`` line, so a design that let the value reach the
serializer would be relying on the backstop as the mechanism.

**Owner-only, categorically** — the same flat refusal as ``security_credentials`` and
``security_audit``. The app-permission middleware is an allowlist, so an app that merely declared
``/api/secrets`` would pass it; an app must not learn even the NAMES of the owner's credentials,
which is why the refusal is here and not left to a permission scope.

**Why ``DELETE`` needs no ``confirm``, unlike the credential-store migration next door.** That
one moves every credential between backends and can lose them all; this removes one named secret
the user picked from a list, and the name is in the request. A confirm flag on a single-row delete
is the kind of ceremony that trains people to send ``confirm: true`` without reading, which is how
the flag stops meaning anything on the route where it matters.
