"""UI-originated tile re-fire, fenced by the tile's FROZEN capability set.

AMBIENT-SURFACES §5.4, third routing case: *"tile widgets → actions run through the
tile's bound workflow (re-fire with bound args), subject to the trigger's frozen
capability set — a rendered button can never introduce actions the trigger didn't
declare (the frozen action-set invariant applies to UI-originated fires too)."*

🔴 WHAT THE FENCE IS HERE, precisely. A tile's body is MODEL-AUTHORED (a genui tree a
workflow or a chat turn wrote), and it renders in the host React tree. So the action name
arriving on this endpoint is untrusted text that a model chose. Without a fence, a
rendered button could name any action provider and the dashboard would dispatch it — the
"a widget introduces a capability nobody consented to" escalation. The fence is the SAVED
binding: the tile's `refresh.data` nodes are the only workflow it has, so the providers
those nodes declare are the only providers a UI-originated fire may reach. The frozen set
is DERIVED FROM PERSISTED STATE, never from the request.

Why the trigger fence's READ-ONLY DEFAULT is deliberately NOT applied. `firepath`'s
capability gate lets a read-only provider through with no `capabilities` block at all,
because no writer populated that block and enforcing without the default would refuse
every automation in existence (S116). A tile's set has the opposite property: it is
derived from the tile's own saved nodes, so it is never empty-by-omission — and applying
the default here would let a button reach a read-only provider the tile never declared,
which is exactly the sentence this module exists to make false. Membership in
`tile_refresh.DATA_PROVIDERS` is checked TOO (defense in depth): the fence bounds what
this tile may do, the allowlist bounds what any tile may do.

DEVIATION (recorded in the plan's execution log): the criterion says "the *trigger's*
frozen capability set", but a tile cannot bind a trigger yet — `TileRefresh.mode: "view"`
(the bound AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE view trigger) is deliberately absent until substrate step
8. So the frozen set is read from the tile's binding today, through `frozen_capabilities`,
which is the ONE place a `mode: "view"` tile will later read `Trigger.capabilities`
instead. The invariant and its enforcement point do not move.
