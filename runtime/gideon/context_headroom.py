"""The headroom contract at the assembly seam (CONTEXT-ECONOMY CE2-8).

Before this module a turn discovered the context limit by **failing at it**: the seam
joined every context block into one string, handed it to the provider, and learned the
prompt was too big from a 400 the provider returned — after the user had already waited.
Nothing measured the assembled size, nothing reserved room for the reply, and nothing
told the user which component was the problem.

This module makes the outcome a **declared value**, computed BEFORE the call:

* :attr:`HeadroomState.FITS` — the assembled prompt is inside the input room.
* :attr:`HeadroomState.FITS_AFTER_COMPRESSION` — it did not fit, compressible components
  were projected down, and it fits now. Every compressed component is NAMED with its
  before/after size (:attr:`Headroom.compressed`), because a silent drop is
  indistinguishable from a wrong answer.
* :attr:`HeadroomState.CANNOT_FIT` — it still does not fit. The verdict carries the
  ``reason`` (with the specific oversized components named, never a generic "overflow")
  and the ``fix``, and its ``text`` is deliberately ``""`` — on a refusal there is
  nothing safe to send.

Callers branch on ``verdict.state``; they never catch an exception to learn the answer.
The seam may then *act* on ``CANNOT_FIT`` by refusing the turn — but the decision was a
value the seam already held, not a failure it ran into.

**The output reserve is part of the bound, not an afterthought.** A prompt that fills the
window exactly leaves no room to answer and fails identically to one that is too long, so
the bound this module compares against is ``window − reserve``, never the window. The
reserve is NOT re-derived here: it is
:func:`gideon.local_models.budgets.output_budget`'s number, the same value
``llm_helpers.py:498`` puts in the provider's ``max_tokens``. One reserve, one authority —
a second output-budget notion would be the defect.

Mechanically it arrives as ``ContextBudget.output_tokens`` from
:func:`gideon.local_models.budgets.model_budget`, which is the derivation
``output_budget`` is the narrow accessor OF (``budgets.py:181-187``). Going through
``model_budget`` costs ONE catalog lookup for the window, the reserve and the source
together, where calling ``output_budget`` separately would reach the provider's
``list_models()`` a second time per turn for a number we already hold.
``test_the_reserve_is_output_budgets_number_not_a_second_one`` asserts the two agree, so
the shortcut cannot drift into a second reserve.

**An UNKNOWN window is not zero and not infinite.** ``local_models.budgets`` already
treats a ``0`` catalog card as "unknown", and ``model_windows.model_context_window``
hands out a hardcoded 200k when no entry names the model. Accepting that default would be
the defaulted-field-is-an-unsupplied-input defect: the whole contract would then be
measured against a number nobody declared. So :func:`resolve_window` asks the table a
second time with ``default=0`` to tell "the table named this model" apart from "the table
defaulted", and reports the latter as ``tokens=None`` / ``source="unknown"`` — the same
discipline :mod:`gideon.local_models.fit` uses, where ``None`` means *unmeasured*
and ``0`` means *measured, nothing fits* (collapsing those two produced a real bug).

An unmeasured window yields ``FITS`` with ``window.measured is False`` and
``pressure is None``. That choice is deliberate in both directions: refusing on an
unmeasured window would turn a mistyped model id into an outage, and *claiming* headroom
would reintroduce the silent failure this module exists to remove. It stays a property of
the EVIDENCE (``window.source``, ``level == "unmeasured"``), not a fourth outcome — the
three states stay closed so callers can branch exhaustively.

**Pressure is observable before the failure.** :attr:`Headroom.level` crosses to
``"warn"`` at :data:`PRESSURE_WARN_FRACTION` of the input room and ``"critical"`` at
:data:`PRESSURE_CRITICAL_FRACTION`, so a long session is told while there is still room to
act rather than only once there is none.

Scope, deliberately: this governs the ASSEMBLY seam — the prompt
:mod:`gideon.context_engine` builds before a turn starts. A tool result produced
MID-turn never passes through here (native history carries it, and a follow-up assembly
injects almost nothing), so it is still bounded where it is produced, by
:func:`gideon.tool_providers.projection.project_output` at dispatch. The
:class:`Component` model represents that shape — a ``"tool result: run_command"`` component
names and refuses exactly like any other — so routing the mid-turn seam through this
contract is a wiring change, not a redesign. It is not done here.
