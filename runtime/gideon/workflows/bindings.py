"""Binding expressions — how a node's output becomes another node's input.

`{{nodes.classify.output.findings | filter('verdict','CONFIRMED') | count}}`

Two resolution paths, deliberately distinct (WF2-R9):

* **Whole-value** — the string is exactly one `{{…}}` ref, so the SOURCE TYPE is
  preserved. `{{nodes.x.output}}` yields the dict, not `"{'a': 1}"`. A `foreach` over
  `{{nodes.x.output.items}}` needs a real list.
* **Interpolated** — the ref sits inside a larger string, so it stringifies. Scalars
  render bare; containers go through `json.dumps`, because embedding a Python `repr`
  into a prompt produces single-quoted pseudo-JSON that models reproduce badly.

The failure modes are also deliberately different. "The node produced null" flows
through as a value (`filter` drops nulls, a declarative `.filter(Boolean)`), while
"this reference does not resolve" — unknown node id, missing path — raises a typed
`BindingError` that gets journaled on the node. A silent empty string here is how a
prompt ends up quietly missing its input and the run produces confident nonsense.

Pipes are a CLOSED set of pure functions. No arbitrary expressions: a spec is data the
flywheel will later propose diffs to, and an eval-shaped hole in it is a remote-code
path with extra steps.
