"""The `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` context block and the staged-turn spec echo.

Two injections that make the chat surface usable, both built on the same rule:

**Never break a turn.** Every function here returns a string — empty on any failure —
and swallows its own errors. A context builder that raises takes the user's whole message
with it, and "the assistant stopped responding because a workflow row was corrupt" is a
far worse outcome than "the assistant did not mention a running workflow". This is why the
old surfacing bridge was written the same way, and why it is not negotiable here.

**Show, don't remember (WF2-R20f).** A model editing a spec from memory edits the spec it
*generated*, not the one on disk — and those diverge the moment anything else touches the
run. So the staged-turn contract puts a rendered tree AND the source spec into the model's
transient context before a mutation turn: it mutates what it just saw.

The block is deliberately terse. A run's full node list would crowd out the user's actual
message; what a model needs is "this exists, it is waiting on you, here is its id".
