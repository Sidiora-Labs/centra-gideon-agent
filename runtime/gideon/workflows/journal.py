"""The journal — the resume cache and the Run Ledger.

Two jobs that share one append-only file, because they are the same data read two ways.

**Resume cache.** After a crash or a rewind, work already done must not be redone. A
cache entry is keyed by `(instance_path, epoch, inputs_hash, spec_region_hash)` — all
four, and each one earns its place:

* `epoch` — a rewind bumps it, so a replayed region from a superseded epoch can never be
  mistaken for a hit on the current one.
* `inputs_hash` — if an upstream output changed, this node's inputs changed, and the
  cached output is stale even though the node itself was not edited.
* `spec_region_hash` — if the node's own config was edited, the cached output came from
  a different prompt. Without this, editing a prompt mid-run and resuming would silently
  serve the pre-edit answer.

A hit emits `step_cached` (WF2-A1) rather than staying invisible: "did my edit actually
re-run anything?" is the first question a user asks after a mid-flight edit, and the
answer has to come from the ledger, not from reading logs.

**Run Ledger.** The event subset the Learning Flywheel's template-refiner reads. These
are emission REQUIREMENTS, not a nice-to-have: a downstream evaluator that wants to know
which model a step used, what it cost, and why it failed is starved if the engine only
journals free text. `resolved_prompt_ref` points at the fully-resolved post-binding
prompt so a trajectory can be replayed — the acceptance bar is that prompt → tool calls
→ output is reconstructable from ledger events alone.

Everything written here passes through `redact()` first. A journal is read back by the
flywheel, shipped in bug reports, and rendered in a UI; a credential that reaches it is
a credential leaked to all three.

        read inline; anything past the boundary leaves a typed `result_omitted` stub so a
        reader knows the data exists rather than seeing a truncated string it might parse.

        Two spill reasons, both about what an inline value costs downstream:

        * `oversize` — over :data:`MAX_INLINE_OUTPUT_BYTES`. The same boundary the live chat
          sanitizer uses; a 5MB tool result must not become a 5MB journal line that every
          later read re-parses, nor a 5MB SSE frame.
        * `binary` — a magic-prefix match (PNG, JPEG, PDF, gzip, zip, ELF…). Detected by
          CONTENT, not size: a 400-byte PNG is under every threshold and still meaningless
          inline — it would render as mojibake in the widget, poison a `{{nodes.x.output}}`
          binding, and (if it reached a model) burn context on noise. Path-agnostic because
          a node's output is not a filename.

        The stub always carries `bytes` and `output_ref`, so the full value stays one read
        away and the stub itself explains why it is a stub.
