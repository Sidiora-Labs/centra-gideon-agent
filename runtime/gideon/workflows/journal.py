"""The journal — the resume cache and the Run Ledger.

Two jobs that share one append-only file, because they are the same data read two ways.

**Resume cache.** After a crash or a rewind, work already done must not be redone. A
cache entry is keyed by `(instance_path, epoch, inputs_hash, spec_region_hash)` — all
four, and each one earns its place:

* `epoch` — a rewind bumps it, so a replayed region from a superseded epoch can never be
  mistaken for a hit on the current one.
* `inputs_hash` — if an upstream output changed, this node's inputs changed, and the
  cached output is stale even though the node itself was not edited.
* `spec_region_hash` — if the node's own config was edited, the cached output came from
  a different prompt. Without this, editing a prompt mid-run and resuming would silently
  serve the pre-edit answer.

A hit emits `step_cached` (WF2-A1) rather than staying invisible: "did my edit actually
re-run anything?" is the first question a user asks after a mid-flight edit, and the
answer has to come from the ledger, not from reading logs.

**Run Ledger.** The event subset the Learning Flywheel's template-refiner reads. These
are emission REQUIREMENTS, not a nice-to-have: a downstream evaluator that wants to know
which model a step used, what it cost, and why it failed is starved if the engine only
journals free text. `resolved_prompt_ref` points at the fully-resolved post-binding
prompt so a trajectory can be replayed — the acceptance bar is that prompt → tool calls
→ output is reconstructable from ledger events alone.

Everything written here passes through `redact()` first. A journal is read back by the
flywheel, shipped in bug reports, and rendered in a UI; a credential that reaches it is
a credential leaked to all three.
