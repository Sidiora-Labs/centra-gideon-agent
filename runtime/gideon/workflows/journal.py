"""The journal — the resume cache and the Run Ledger, as the workflow engine flavours them.

Two jobs that share one append-only file, because they are the same data read two ways.

**Resume cache.** After a crash or a rewind, work already done must not be redone. A
cache entry is keyed by `(instance_path, epoch, inputs_hash, spec_region_hash)` — all
four, and each one earns its place:

* `epoch` — a rewind bumps it, so a replayed region from a superseded epoch can never be
  mistaken for a hit on the current one.
* `inputs_hash` — if an upstream output changed, this node's inputs changed, and the
  cached output is stale even though the node itself was not edited.
* `spec_region_hash` — if the node's own config was edited, the cached output came from
  a different prompt. Without this, editing a prompt mid-run and resuming would silently
  serve the pre-edit answer.

A hit emits `step_cached` (WF2-A1) rather than staying invisible: "did my edit actually
re-run anything?" is the first question a user asks after a mid-flight edit, and the
answer has to come from the ledger, not from reading logs.

**Run Ledger.** The event subset the Learning Flywheel's template-refiner reads. These
are emission REQUIREMENTS, not a nice-to-have: a downstream evaluator that wants to know
which model a step used, what it cost, and why it failed is starved if the engine only
journals free text. `resolved_prompt_ref` points at the fully-resolved post-binding
prompt so a trajectory can be replayed — the acceptance bar is that prompt → tool calls
→ output is reconstructable from ledger events alone.

Everything written here passes through `redact()` first. A journal is read back by the
flywheel, shipped in bug reports, and rendered in a UI; a credential that reaches it is
a credential leaked to all three.

**What lives here and what does not (PP-4).** The mechanism — sequencing, stamping, redaction,
the `events.jsonl` mirror, the oversize/binary spill, the event vocabulary — is
:mod:`gideon.ledger`, because none of it is workflow-shaped and a second producer must
speak the same words rather than invent a dialect. What stays is the WORKFLOW FLAVOUR, and the
line between them is a question about node identity: everything below needs a node path, an
`epoch`, an `InstanceState` or a `Failure` to mean anything.

* the typed emitters — their arguments are engine types;
* the resume cache's KEY and its lookup (`CacheKey`, `lookup`, `invalidate_prefix`) — an epoch is
  a rewind counter and `SUCCESS_STATES` is an engine enum. The generic half, folding the file into
  a key→record map, is the writer's, because that same pass recovers `seq`;
* `spec_region_hash`, which knows that `children`/`body`/`cases`/`default` are a node's children.

`LEDGER_KINDS` and every kind constant are re-exported unchanged, so the drift tests that assert
the engine still emits all of them keep binding to this module.
