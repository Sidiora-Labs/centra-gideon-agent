made a task a projection of a node. This session makes "done" mean something: the ENGINE runs
the criterion, never the worker, and a stage that completes without its criterion passing
projects as BLOCKED rather than done. That is the whole point, and it is the same hole in two
places. A worker reporting its own success is the node-level version; an agent tool call marking
its own task done is the task-level version. Both are closed here by the same principle — the
actor that did the work is not the actor that judges it. Three properties carry the module, and
each fails in a chosen direction: * **A criterion that could not RUN is not a pass.**
`loop/gates.run_verify_command` already returns a tristate for exactly this reason — `None`
means "can't tell" (missing binary, refused by the safety screen, timed out). Reading `None` as
success would make a broken check indistinguishable from a passing one, and the broken one is
silent. * **The actor matrix is per-actor, not per-transition.** An agent may PROPOSE
(`blocked(needs_input)`, review) and may not CLAIM (`in_progress`, `done`). Without the split,
the tool an agent uses to report a problem is also the tool it uses to declare victory. * **A
cascade blocks dependents rather than leaving them open.** After a prerequisite dies, a
dependent sitting `open` makes the board claim workable work that cannot start — the board lies,
and the user plans from it. Pure decisions over state. Command execution stays with `loop/gates`
(one implementation of the tristate, one safety screen), and the registry write stays with the
caller.
