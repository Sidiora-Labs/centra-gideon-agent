"""Plan revision — typed merge-by-id patches, and the review surface they edit.

A revision is not a regeneration. When a user says "make stage 3 use the fast model", asking the
planner for a whole new spec re-rolls the dice on the twelve stages nobody complained about — and
the drift is silent, because the new spec is also plausible. So a revision emits ONLY changed
steps, merged by node id: same id replaces, new id adds, absent id is preserved untouched. The
plan measures that as roughly 60 tokens against 400, but the token count is the smaller half of
the argument; the real one is that an untouched stage's parameterization *cannot* change.

**The NO_UPDATE sentinel** is the fast path. A revising model emits either the literal sentinel —
no parse, no merge, no cost — or a typed mutation set. Never a free-text rewrite, because a
free-text rewrite has to be diffed to find out what it meant, and a diff of prose is a guess.

**Insertion-only where it fits.** A reviewer's comment adds an attributed step rather than
rewriting an existing one, which gives revise-comments clean provenance: the plan can show who
asked for what, and an original step stays recognisably original.

**Sketches are TTL'd.** A draft plan is a conversation artifact, not a stored one. Keeping it
forever means a stale sketch resurfacing next week as if it were current; dropping it too early
means a user's revision landing on something that no longer exists. Both failures are silent,
which is why the TTL is explicit and the expiry is reported rather than assumed.
