"""The free rule tier — everything decidable without a model, decided first.

Loop judges run every cycle. So the ordering here is not an optimization detail: a
rule-solvable failure that reaches the probabilistic model costs tokens on every
iteration of every run, forever. This is the single largest token saving available in
the loop design, and it also makes the cheap failures *deterministic* — a missing
artifact should never be a judgement call.

Four rule families, cheapest first:

1. **Mechanical validation** — schema, length, forbidden content. Microseconds.
2. **Failure-pattern regexes** — tool errors and verbal give-ups the worker already
   admitted to in its own output. If the worker said "I couldn't get this working",
   no model needs to adjudicate that.
3. **Structural pre-checks** — referenced files exist, links resolve.
4. **Existence/non-emptiness** — did this produce anything at all? Zero artifacts and
   zero commits is not a borderline case.

Anything that survives all four is genuinely a judgement call, and only then is the
model worth its cost.

**A pre-tier verdict is always a REJECT or a pass-through, never a PASS.** These rules
can prove work is *unfinished*; they cannot prove it is *good*. Letting the cheap tier
issue a PASS would recreate self-approval with extra steps.
