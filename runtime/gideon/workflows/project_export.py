"""Project export/import: a manifest ZIP with integrity and path safety (§1.7, R15 — S54).

This is **net-new coverage**, not an extension: `snapshot.VALID_COMPONENTS` covers memory, crons,
config, skills, workspace, notifications and security — and neither `projects/` nor `tasks/` nor
`artifacts/` is in it. A project today cannot be moved off the machine at all.

What travels: the brief, the living overview, the wayfinder ledgers, context files, project-local
templates, artifact METADATA and run digests — with a sha256 per entity in `manifest.json`.

What does NOT travel, and why each is a decision rather than an omission:

* **Secrets never travel.** Not encrypted, not optional — absent, with presence flags in
their place.
  The exclude-set is `portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE`, which is itself a projection of the state
  inventory's `secret=True` entries. Reusing it is the whole point: a second hand-maintained list is
  exactly the drift that let stores escape coverage before.
* **Workspace directories are excluded** (too large). Only metadata, templates and
  digests — an export
  that tried to carry a `node_modules` would be an export nobody completes.
* **Artifact BODIES do not travel, only their metadata.** A 50-version image history would dwarf
  everything else in the archive, and the metadata is what makes the lineage readable on
  the far side.

Import is where the danger lives, so its rules are stated as refusals:

* **Path safety reuses `snapshot._data_filter`** — traversal, absolute paths, symlinks
and hardlinks
  are rejected inside the extraction filter, which is what closes the TOCTOU gap a pre-scan leaves
  open. Writing a second checker here would mean two postures, and the weaker one would win wherever
  it ran.
* **A checksum mismatch REFUSES the entity**, and says which. Importing a file whose hash does not
  match the manifest is importing something the exporter did not send.
* **A name collision gets an `imported-N` slot**, never an overwrite. The user's existing project is
  the one thing an import must not damage.

Pure planning + manifest arithmetic. The archive I/O stays with the caller; this module decides what
belongs, what it hashes to, and what an import may accept.
