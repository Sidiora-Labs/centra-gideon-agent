"""Surfacing channels 2 and 3, scope resolution, pre-fill and the doctor (TASKS-SOPS §2 — S59).

Channel 1 (semantic match) is the old mechanism and stays where it is. This module owns the two
channels a per-turn embedding match structurally CANNOT express, plus the three contracts that
decide whether a match is allowed to become a suggestion:

* **Channel 2 — cadence (R8).** "It has been 40 days since the backup checklist ran" is not a
  similarity question, so no threshold can answer it. Last-completed comes from real run history
  (`store.list_runs(status=COMPLETE)`) — history the old SOP feature never had.
* **Channel 3 — workspace fingerprint (R19).** Weighted file-glob packs, scored on directory
  attach only. Pure pattern matching, zero LLM cost, and **propose-don't-enable**: the scan
  produces ONE grouped dismissible suggestion, never an enablement.
* **R18 — layered scope resolution.** Narrower shadows wider, and a shadowed def stays VISIBLE
  with a state. A silently hidden def is the failure that makes a user rewrite a procedure they
  already had.
* **R11 — pre-fill + requirements preflight.** A suggestion whose requirements are unmet fails AT
  SUGGESTION TIME naming the missing item, rather than dying mid-run.
* **The reachability doctor.** The mirror failure of over-firing: a def nothing can reach. gbrain's
  audit found 63 silently unreachable skills on its first run.

Everything here is pure functions over records. The two on-disk touches (the cadence ledger and
per-project dismissals) go through `store.config_dir()` so the dev home rail holds.
