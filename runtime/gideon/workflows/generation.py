"""Spec generation — the prompt, the self-check, and repair-not-regenerate.

Three mechanisms, each answering a measured failure:

**A GENERATED prompt.** The hand-written YAML reference block in the plan's first revision was
stale the moment a provider changed, and a stale reference fails exactly like a hallucination:
the planner emits something the validator rejects and the error blames the spec. So the prompt is
assembled from `grounding.build_bundle()` every time, with the hard requirements placed ABOVE the
intent — a constraint after the task reads as an afterthought to a model working top-down.

**A mechanical self-check before anything is presented.** Unique ids, a terminal node, gates with
criteria, foreach with a binding, no surviving slot placeholders. These are all cheap and all
catchable without a model, and catching them here rather than at validation means the repair note
can name the fix rather than the symptom.

**Repair, not regenerate.** An invalid spec comes back with a failure-specific correction note and
the ORIGINAL spec attached, so the model edits rather than restarts. Regeneration throws away the
90% that was right and re-rolls the same dice on it — measured elsewhere in this program as the
difference between converging in one retry and oscillating between two wrong answers.

The planner may also **honestly decline**: `{cannot_plan: reason}` is a valid emission, and a
declining planner is worth far more than one that produces a plausible spec for an impossible
request.
