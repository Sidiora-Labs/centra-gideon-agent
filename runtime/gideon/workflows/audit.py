"""`workflow_audit` — diagnose and heal a run store that drifted (WF2-R10).

The watchdog handles the failures it can see while running. This handles the ones that
accumulate when it was *not* running: a gateway killed mid-write, a subagent that
vanished while its node stayed RUNNING, a gate parked on a deadline that passed weeks
ago, journal keys orphaned by a rewind.

Every finding is a typed record with a `heal` verb, and **`dry_run` defaults to True**.
An auto-repair that runs before a human has seen the diagnosis is how a maintenance tool
turns one broken run into a broken store — the ordering (diagnose, show, then heal on
request) is the safety property, not a UX preference.

Healing is deliberately narrow. It writes terminal statuses onto runs that have **no
live controller**, which is the same safety argument the watchdog's orphan reap rests on:
with no controller there is no second writer to race (WF2-R10). A run with a live
controller is reported and left alone.
