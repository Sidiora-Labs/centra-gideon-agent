"""Admission policies — the ordered rules that decide what the frontier may launch (PP-11).

Four schedulers in this repo answer the same question — *what may run now, given persisted
state?* — and share zero lines: `workflows/tick.frontier()` (typed lanes, per-container
`max_concurrency`, WIP=1), `loop/tick.evaluate()` (dwell / `min_findings` / metric gates),
`workflows/pool.py`'s `frontier`/`next` (priority + blocking-count + overdue with TTL'd leases),
and `triggers/` `tick_once`. Each holds a capability the others structurally cannot express, so
every new admission rule lands wherever its author happened to be standing.

This module is the seam that makes them one mechanism. `PP-11` introduced **nothing new**: `Lane`,
`ContainerConcurrency` and `Wip` are exactly the three rules `frontier()` already applied, moved
behind a named interface and composed explicitly. That restraint was the point — a refactor that
also changed behaviour could not be verified, because there is no oracle for *"did the scheduler
still decide the same thing"*. The oracle is `tests/test_workflows_frontier_golden.py`, whose
fixtures were captured before a line of this existed.

`PP-12` is where capability lands, on the seam already proven inert: `Lease` (exclusive occupancy of
a named external resource — the pool's capability), and `Dwell`/`MetricGate` (a bake floor and a
metric gate that rolls a step back — the loop's). Both reuse the proven implementation rather than
re-deriving it: `Lease` decides with `pool.acquire`, the same compare-and-swap decision the task
pool's flocked claim path uses, and `Dwell`/`MetricGate` parse with the loop's own
`step_config_from_phase` and judge with `loop.tick.evaluate`. Nothing here is a second
implementation of anything. `default_policies(state=None)` returns `PP-11`'s three, so a spec
declaring none of the new keys runs the same code it always did — additivity by construction,
re-proven by the golden file.

**One shape covers both of today's admission questions.** Lane admission asks "may one more `llm`
node start, given how many are already in flight"; a capped `foreach` asks "may one more item of
this container start, given how many are already under way". Both are *a capacity over a keyed
bucket*, which is why one `AdmissionRequest` → `capacity` → `admits(in_flight)` chain expresses
both, and why a policy that has no opinion on a scope simply returns `None` instead of needing a
scope-specific list.

**Tightest wins, and ties go to the named refusal.** Composing by minimum is the only rule that
cannot be gamed by policy order: adding a policy may narrow what runs, never widen it. Ties matter
because two policies really can bind at the same number — `max_concurrency: 1` under a run-level
WIP=1 invariant — and the *number* being equal does not make the two refusals equal. One is a
declared invariant being enforced, which the run records by name in `Frontier.wip_held` so "why is
item 2 not running" is answerable from the ledger; the other is anonymous container pressure,
recorded nowhere. So a tie is broken toward the higher `rank`, and the invariant ranks above the
capacity limit. That is not a new rule: it is `cap = 1 if wip else _max_concurrency(node)` — the
line this module replaces — written down where it can be tested.

**Purity is load-bearing.** No clock, no I/O, no randomness, and no mutation of the arguments. The
frontier is re-derived from persisted state every tick rather than incrementally patched, which is
what makes `rewind` tractable and replay meaningful; a policy that consulted the wall clock would
decide differently on replay and the journal's guarantees would be worthless. Enforced by an AST
rail in `tests/test_workflows_frontier_golden.py`, not by convention.

A lease TTL and a bake floor both imply a clock, which is exactly the rail `PP-12` had to satisfy
rather than route around. It is satisfied by taking `now` as a PARAMETER (`AdmissionState`), the
way `pool.acquire(..., now=)` and `loop.tick.evaluate(cfg, state, now)` already do: the impurity
moves to the single caller that owns a clock and the run's persisted state, and every `capacity()`
here stays a pure function of what it was handed. The rail still passes unweakened — the two
modules it scans import no clock, and `AdmissionState` is what makes that possible rather than
what hides it.

    Built once per `frontier()` call and threaded down the recursion, so every container in a run is

    is this atom's additivity guarantee made structural. `frontier()` is pure and cannot build an
    `AdmissionState`, so the frontier's list is unchanged by construction and `PP-11`'s golden file
    is a real proof rather than a coincidence. The `PP-12` policies answer scopes the frontier
