"""Admission policies — the ordered rules that decide what the frontier may launch (PP-11).

Four schedulers in this repo answer the same question — *what may run now, given persisted
state?* — and share zero lines: `workflows/tick.frontier()` (typed lanes, per-container
`max_concurrency`, WIP=1), `loop/tick.evaluate()` (dwell / `min_findings` / metric gates),
`workflows/pool.py`'s `frontier`/`next` (priority + blocking-count + overdue with TTL'd leases),
and `triggers/` `tick_once`. Each holds a capability the others structurally cannot express, so
every new admission rule lands wherever its author happened to be standing.

This module is the seam that makes them one mechanism. It introduces **nothing new**: the three
policies below are exactly the three rules `frontier()` already applied, moved behind a named
interface and composed explicitly. That restraint is the point — a refactor that also changed
behaviour could not be verified, because there is no oracle for *"did the scheduler still decide
the same thing"*. The oracle here is `tests/test_workflows_frontier_golden.py`, whose fixtures were
captured before a line of this existed. New capability (`Lease`, `Dwell`, `MetricGate`) lands in
`PP-12`, on a seam already proven inert.

**One shape covers both of today's admission questions.** Lane admission asks "may one more `llm`
node start, given how many are already in flight"; a capped `foreach` asks "may one more item of
this container start, given how many are already under way". Both are *a capacity over a keyed
bucket*, which is why one `AdmissionRequest` → `capacity` → `admits(in_flight)` chain expresses
both, and why a policy that has no opinion on a scope simply returns `None` instead of needing a
scope-specific list.

**Tightest wins, and ties go to the named refusal.** Composing by minimum is the only rule that
cannot be gamed by policy order: adding a policy may narrow what runs, never widen it. Ties matter
because two policies really can bind at the same number — `max_concurrency: 1` under a run-level
WIP=1 invariant — and the *number* being equal does not make the two refusals equal. One is a
declared invariant being enforced, which the run records by name in `Frontier.wip_held` so "why is
item 2 not running" is answerable from the ledger; the other is anonymous container pressure,
recorded nowhere. So a tie is broken toward the higher `rank`, and the invariant ranks above the
capacity limit. That is not a new rule: it is `cap = 1 if wip else _max_concurrency(node)` — the
line this module replaces — written down where it can be tested.

**Purity is load-bearing.** No clock, no I/O, no randomness, and no mutation of the arguments. The
frontier is re-derived from persisted state every tick rather than incrementally patched, which is
what makes `rewind` tractable and replay meaningful; a policy that consulted the wall clock would
decide differently on replay and the journal's guarantees would be worthless. Enforced by an AST
rail in `tests/test_workflows_frontier_golden.py`, not by convention.
