"""The grounding bundle — what a planner is allowed to know, read from the live system.

Generating a workflow spec is the most failure-prone step in planning, and the measured cause
is not model capability: it is that an ungrounded planner invents node kinds, provider names and
argument shapes that look plausible and do not exist. The plan's own measurement puts
first-try-valid at 0/5 ungrounded and 4/5 grounded, with silent spec misses going 3 → 0.

**Regenerated from the registries, never hand-written.** A hand-maintained reference is wrong the
first time a provider is added and nobody notices, because a stale reference fails the same way a
hallucination does — the planner emits something the validator rejects, and the error names the
spec rather than the reference. So node kinds come from `NodeKind`, providers from the action
registry, and argument shapes from `MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS` and the providers' own docstrings.

**Orient, then drill.** The bundle has an INDEX (every provider, one line each) and DETAIL
(full signatures, on request). Handing a planner every signature for sixteen providers spends
context on fifteen it will not use, and the index is what lets it choose before it reads.

**Two signature sources, joined, because neither is complete.** Measured: only some providers
document their `action_config` shape in a docstring, and `create-task` / `notify` have no
docstring at all — a docstring-only bundle would hand the planner an empty signature for exactly
the providers a plan most often reaches for. `MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS` has typed fields with required
flags for the tool-backed ones. Where both exist the typed schema wins; where neither does, the
bundle says so rather than implying the provider takes no arguments.
