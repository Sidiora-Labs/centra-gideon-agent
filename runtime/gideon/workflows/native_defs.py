"""The native filesystem definition provider — where a user's own workflows live.

`defs.py` is the registry SEAM; this is the provider that makes it usable. Without it only
an installed app could contribute definitions, so a user with no app installed could not
save a workflow at all — the API correctly reported "no writable provider", which is an
honest error and a dead end.

One directory per definition under `<config>/workflows/defs/<name>/workflow.json`, mirroring
how apps and prompts are stored. A directory rather than a flat file because a definition
will grow siblings (spec history, bundled prompt blocks), and moving to a directory later
would be a migration.

**Versioning is on every save**, and it is load-bearing: a run pins the spec version it
started from, and a mutation diffs against its predecessor. A save that reused the version
would make `expect_version` meaningless.

Reads are tolerant — a corrupt or hand-edited file is skipped in a listing rather than
breaking every other definition — because the listing is how a user finds the broken one to
fix it.
