"""Per-run inbound file drop and outbound artifact listing (WORK-CONTAINERS §2.5, R17).

The two directions a run exchanges files with its human, kept in ONE module because they are one
feature with one enable/disable decision — split across two, "drop is on but the outbox is off"
becomes a state nobody designed.

**In — the file drop.** Approval-gated multipart ingestion. Files land in the run's
``dropped/`` zone, whose lifecycle is ``immutable`` (§4.2): the agent may READ what a human handed
it and may not rewrite it, because reference material an agent can edit is reference material that
cannot be cited later. Ingested files are never inlined into a prompt unfenced — the read path hands
them through ``fence_untrusted``, since a dropped file is by definition content the operator did not
author.

Named "file drop", not "inbox": Gideon already has an Inbox feature and a second noun with the
same name would collide in every conversation about either.

**Out — the outbox.** The run's PUBLISHED-artifact listing, derived from what ``apply_publish``
recorded rather than from a second registry: an outbox that maintained its own list would drift from
the artifacts the run actually created, and the drift would always favour claiming more than
happened.

Pure-ish functions plus a thin filesystem layer, matching ``publish.py``: the gating and naming
rules are testable without a gateway.
