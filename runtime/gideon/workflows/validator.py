"""Spec validation — structural checks with typed, stable issue codes.

Two rules shape this module (WF2-R12):

* **It never throws on a malformed spec.** A validator that raises on the first problem
  forces an LLM author into one-error-per-turn ping-pong. This accumulates every issue
  and returns them together, so a repromptable error message can list all of them.
* **Codes are stable strings.** `WF_UNKNOWN_NODE_KIND` is a contract an agent branches
  on; rewording the human message must never change the code.

`strict` separates "this spec cannot run" from "this spec is questionable". Warnings
inform an author; errors block a save. The untrusted-origin lint (WF2-R9) is an ERROR by
design — that is the seam that stops trigger payloads flowing unfenced into prompts, and
making it advisory would leave it to template-author discipline.

    the two nodes themselves. That is what makes "an earlier sibling within an enclosing
    `sequence`" mean what an author expects: a producer buried inside an earlier sibling

    sibling is, because a container completes only after its children do.

    sibling `needs` — so two concurrent legs of a `parallel` were unordered and the author had
    to hand-write the edge. The frontier now enforces the derived edge itself
    (`tick.ordering_for`), so concurrency is no longer a refusal: the reader simply waits.
    What remains False is the set of shapes where NO amount of waiting helps, because the
    structure itself contradicts the edge — the producer encloses or is enclosed by the
    reader, a `sequence` runs it after the reader, or a `branch` makes the two exclusive.
    Those are the deadlocks, and refusing them at authoring time is the whole point.

    Deliberately NOT decided here: whether the producer actually RAN. A producer inside a

    The engine keeps two edge lists and nothing checked they agree. Admission reads

    graph feeding the resume cache, the stale-inputs check and the mutation cascade. So a
    spec could bind `{{nodes.x.output}}` from a node that runs beside — or before — `x`,
    and the run died at ready-time with *"binding failed: check the referenced node id and
    field exist"* pointing the author at an id that was perfectly correct. Locally
    plausible, globally wrong, and only discoverable by running it.

    `PP-1` added no runtime behaviour — the check existed purely so the disagreement was a
    typed authoring-time refusal instead of a mid-run failure. `PP-2` then removed the
    disagreement itself by making the frontier consume this very list.

    Runs AFTER `_kahn_levels` and stays quiet when a cycle was found: on a cyclic graph the
    only advice this rule can give ("order the producer first") is the advice that closes
    the loop, so `WF_CYCLE` is both the truer fact and the one an author must fix first.

    **`PP-2` narrowed what reaches this rule.** The frontier now holds a reader until the
    producers its bindings name are terminal, so "they run concurrently" is no longer an
    unordered edge — it is an edge the scheduler honours. What is left is the set of
    structural contradictions no wait can resolve, where the run would hang instead of
    failing at ready-time. The rule did not become weaker; the engine grew the guarantee the
    rule used to have to demand from the author. `EDGE_NEEDS` edges are `_validate_needs`'

    `needs` used to be the engine's only admission input and was refused unless it named a

    exactly one job left: to express ordering that is NOT dataflow — a lock, an external
    side-effect sequence, "publish only after the announcement went out". Two things follow.

    **A `needs` the structure cannot honour is an ERROR.** `needs: ["later"]` on the first
    child of a `sequence` that runs `later` third is not an ordering, it is a contradiction:
    the frontier would hold the reader for a producer the sequence will not start until the
    reader finishes, and the run hangs. Before `PP-2` this was invisible — `needs` outside a
    `parallel` was inert, so the author's declared ordering silently did nothing at all.
    Honouring it globally is what turns that dead declaration into either a real edge or a
    real error, and the error is much the better of the two.

    **A `needs` the bindings ALREADY imply is a WARNING.** `needs: ["a"]` on a node whose own
    config reads `{{nodes.a.output}}` is a second edge list one entry long: it restates what
    the binding says, and the two can now only ever drift apart. Deleting it changes nothing
    about the schedule, which is what makes this the safe half to report.

    **Deviation from the plan's step 3, recorded deliberately.** The plan asked for the
    opposite warning — on a `needs` ABSENT from the derived set — as "either real non-dataflow
    ordering or a stale edge". But absence is now the field's ONLY legitimate use, so that
    warning would fire on every correct `needs` in the tree while carrying no way to say "yes,
    I meant it". `PP-3`'s warning in this same file was scoped for exactly that reason: a rule
    that fires on the normal case is how an author learns to skim validator output. The origin
    tag is on every `DepEdge`, so an inspection surface can still show which `needs` carry no
    dataflow without spending the author's attention on it at every save.
