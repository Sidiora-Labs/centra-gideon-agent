"""Spec validation — structural checks with typed, stable issue codes.

Two rules shape this module (WF2-R12):

* **It never throws on a malformed spec.** A validator that raises on the first problem
  forces an LLM author into one-error-per-turn ping-pong. This accumulates every issue
  and returns them together, so a repromptable error message can list all of them.
* **Codes are stable strings.** `WF_UNKNOWN_NODE_KIND` is a contract an agent branches
  on; rewording the human message must never change the code.

`strict` separates "this spec cannot run" from "this spec is questionable". Warnings
inform an author; errors block a save. The untrusted-origin lint (WF2-R9) is an ERROR by
design — that is the seam that stops trigger payloads flowing unfenced into prompts, and
making it advisory would leave it to template-author discipline.
