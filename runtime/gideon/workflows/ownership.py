"""Run session ownership + incognito inheritance (WORK-CONTAINERS §5.1, S50).

A run may OWN sessions and may be LAUNCHED FROM one. Both directions need a contract:

* **Ownership** gives a run's stage sessions a key of their own —
  `workflow:<run_id>:<node_id>` — registered alongside the existing conventions
  (`loop-<id>`, `cron:<id>`, `subagent:<id>`). Two seams have to learn it: SEL's source
  inference, and behaviour keying.
* **Inheritance** carries a temporary/incognito origin DOWN into every session the run owns. A run
  launched from an incognito chat that quietly wrote memories from its stages would defeat the mode
  entirely — and it would do so invisibly, because the chat itself stayed clean.

Two facts about the existing machinery decide the shape here, both verified in code:

1. **Behaviour is keyed off `session._app`, not the key prefix.** The `loop_`/`loop:` prefix-
match in
   `context._prompt_use_case_for` is a known near-miss the plan explicitly says not to repeat. So
   ownership sets `_app` and the key is only an identifier.
2. **`session_restrictions` is process-global and forgets on restart**, while a session's JSONL
   `memory_mode` line survives. `session_search.is_restricted` already reads BOTH for exactly that
   reason. Suppression here follows that precedent rather than inventing a third store: the registry
   is the fast path, the durable line is the truth after a restart.

The asymmetry that matters: **a lookup failure means RESTRICTED, not unrestricted.** An unavailable
registry or an unreadable metadata line must not open the gate — the cost of a wrongly-suppressed
memory write is a lost note, and the cost of a wrongly-permitted one is a memory the user believed
was never recorded.

Pure functions over keys and metadata. No I/O; the caller marks the registry and writes the JSONL.
