"""The frontier — a PURE function from (spec tree, instance states) to what may run now.

This module is deliberately free of I/O, clocks, and randomness. `frontier()` takes a
spec and a state map and returns a decision; the same inputs always produce the same
output. That is not stylistic preference, it is what makes the engine testable and
`rewind` tractable: after a rewind mutates state, the scheduler is re-derived from
scratch rather than patched, so there is no incremental bookkeeping to get wrong.

Three rules carry most of the design weight:

**Containers do not execute.** A `sequence` has no work of its own — it is a scheduling
policy over its children. So the frontier recurses into containers and only ever
returns leaf work. A container's own state is *derived* from its children's, which is
why `container_outcome()` exists and why nothing writes a container's state directly.

**Active-edge join gating (WF2-R18).** A join must not wait on a leg that will never run.
A `branch` picking `cases[bug]` leaves `cases[feat]` unreachable; a join that waited on
"all predecessors" would deadlock forever. Conversely a join firing on "any completed
predecessor" fires early on a fan-out whose other legs are still waiting. Both directions
are bugs, so the rule here is: **a `needs` edge is satisfied by any TERMINAL predecessor,
and unreachable paths are made terminal by marking them SKIPPED.** Declining is recorded
explicitly (`declined_edges`) rather than inferred from "the source routed elsewhere" —
inferring it would starve a sibling whose `needs` names a branch, since routing among
cases says nothing about that sibling.

The wait-entry subtlety still matters: a `wait`/`gate` enters WAITING rather than
completing, and WAITING is not terminal, so a join behind it correctly keeps waiting
instead of firing on the fast leg alone.

**Typed lanes (WF2-R21).** Ready work is admitted per-lane, derived from node kind. A
`foreach` over minute-long local-model actions saturates the `io` lane while `llm`
stages keep flowing. Excess stays `ready` rather than being dropped — the next tick
admits it.

The frontier reports `blocked` when nothing can run and nothing is running: that state
is a deadlock, and naming it here rather than letting the run hang forever is the whole
point of computing it.
