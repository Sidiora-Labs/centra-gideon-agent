"""The frontier — a PURE function from (spec tree, instance states) to what may run now.

This module is deliberately free of I/O, clocks, and randomness. `frontier()` takes a
spec and a state map and returns a decision; the same inputs always produce the same
output. That is not stylistic preference, it is what makes the engine testable and
`rewind` tractable: after a rewind mutates state, the scheduler is re-derived from
scratch rather than patched, so there is no incremental bookkeeping to get wrong.

Three rules carry most of the design weight:

**Containers do not execute.** A `sequence` has no work of its own — it is a scheduling
policy over its children. So the frontier recurses into containers and only ever
returns leaf work. A container's own state is *derived* from its children's, which is
why `container_outcome()` exists and why nothing writes a container's state directly.

**Active-edge join gating (WF2-R18).** A join must not wait on a leg that will never run.
A `branch` picking `cases[bug]` leaves `cases[feat]` unreachable; a join that waited on
"all predecessors" would deadlock forever. Conversely a join firing on "any completed
predecessor" fires early on a fan-out whose other legs are still waiting. Both directions
are bugs, so the rule here is: **a `needs` edge is satisfied by any TERMINAL predecessor,
and unreachable paths are made terminal by marking them SKIPPED.** Declining is recorded
explicitly (`declined_edges`) rather than inferred from "the source routed elsewhere" —
inferring it would starve a sibling whose `needs` names a branch, since routing among
cases says nothing about that sibling.

The wait-entry subtlety still matters: a `wait`/`gate` enters WAITING rather than
completing, and WAITING is not terminal, so a join behind it correctly keeps waiting
instead of firing on the fast leg alone.

**Admission is a policy list, not a rule (PP-11).** Every "may this start?" question in this
module goes through `admission.compose()` over one ordered list of `AdmissionPolicy` objects —
today typed lane caps, a container's `max_concurrency`, and the run's WIP=1 invariant — composed
tightest-wins. Three schedulers elsewhere in the repo answer the same question with their own
rules; this seam is where they converge. The list is built once per `frontier()` call and threaded
down the recursion, so a run-level invariant cannot become per-node-optional by accident.

Lane admission itself is WF2-R21: ready work is admitted per-lane, derived from node kind, so a
`foreach` over minute-long local-model actions saturates the `io` lane while `llm` stages keep
flowing. Excess is `deferred` rather than dropped — the next tick admits it.

The frontier reports `blocked` when nothing can run and nothing is running: that state
is a deadlock, and naming it here rather than letting the run hang forever is the whole
point of computing it.

    """One body instance per item. Item paths are `<path>.body#<i>` — the `#i` suffix is
    what lets many instances of one body node coexist in a flat state map.

    **On `pipeline` (WF2-R5).** The plan describes it as "no barrier between stages". Measured
    against the real engine, there is no barrier to remove: because each item's body is an
    independent subtree and the frontier is re-derived every tick, item 0 enters stage 2 as soon as
    its own stage 1 finishes, regardless of where the other items are. Streaming handoff is
    already the engine's only behaviour, and a `pipeline: false` that imposed a barrier would be
    NEW machinery whose sole purpose is to make fan-outs slower.

    So `pipeline` is accepted, documented and non-semantic for scheduling — and the knob that
    genuinely governs a fan-out's shape is `max_concurrency`.

    **`max_concurrency`** caps how many ITEMS are in flight at once, independent of the global lane
    caps. Without it a fan-out over fifty files occupies every compute slot in the engine and
    starves the rest of the run; with it a template can say "two at a time" and mean it. Unset is
    unbounded, which is right for the common case of a handful of cheap items.

    An item counts against the cap from its first launched node until its whole body is terminal:
    the point of the cap is usually a scarce resource an item holds for its duration (a checkout, a
    lock, a rate-limited endpoint), and releasing it between stages would defeat that.

    Both `max_concurrency` and the run-level **WIP=1 invariant** (`single_active_feature`,
    LOOPS-EVOLUTION R5b: +37% feature completion) reach this container through the same policy list
    (`admission.ContainerConcurrency` and `admission.Wip`), composed tightest-wins. WIP therefore
    OVERRIDES whatever this node declared — and wins even the TIE at `max_concurrency: 1`, because a
    run-level invariant a per-node knob can contradict is not an invariant, and clamping silently is
    what makes a control look enforced while a `max_concurrency: 3` quietly wins. The contradiction
    is refused at authoring time by the validator (`WF_WIP_CONTRADICTION`); this is the runtime
    half, and the items it refuses to start are named in `fr.wip_held`.

    shipped as a DECLARED STRATEGY WITH NO EXECUTOR. `models.py` declared it, `validator.py`
    accepted it and the capabilities manifest advertised it to authoring models — while the
    derivation branched on `HALT` and `SKIP` only and let `collect` fall through to
    `container_outcome`. The fallthrough happened to produce roughly the right shape, which is
    exactly why it survived: nothing was visibly broken, and nothing anywhere said what the
    member meant. A fourth member added tomorrow would have inherited `SKIP`'s wait and
    `HALT`'s verdict just as silently. So the choice is made HERE, once, exhaustively over the
    enum, and the unreachable tail RAISES rather than defaulting (WV-13).

    Every member's branch is driven by a test, and the three produce three DIFFERENT run-level
    observables for the same seeded failure — which is the only proof that the members are
    worth having:

    * `HALT` → the run FAILS having skipped the rest of the fan-out.
    * `SKIP` → the run COMPLETES (container DEGRADED) having run all of it.
    * `COLLECT` → the run FAILS having run all of it.

    `COLLECT` returns `container_outcome` rather than a hard-coded FAILED on purpose: an item
    that was CANCELLED or BLOCKED outranks a failure in `_worst`'s severity order, and
    flattening "someone cancelled item 2" into "the fan-out failed" would throw away the more

    The plan describes a watcher as cancelled by "a sibling completing in a `join: any`
    parallel". Measured, that does not happen on its own: `container_outcome` checks for
    non-terminal children BEFORE the ANY rule, so a parallel whose watcher is still running
    reads RUNNING and the run never completes. That check is correct and deliberate
    (a join must not fire early on a fan-out whose other legs are still working) — so the
    reaping is a separate, narrower rule rather than a change to join semantics.

    The rule: inside a `join: any` (or `quorum`, once met) parallel, an `until_cancelled`
    loop is reaped once ENOUGH of its non-watcher siblings have succeeded. A watcher never
    counts toward its own parallel's join, because a mode with no exit condition can never
    be the leg that satisfies one.

    Returns paths, not a mutation: the controller owns writes, and keeping this pure is what
    makes "would this watcher be reaped?" answerable in a unit test.
