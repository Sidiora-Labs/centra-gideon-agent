"""Run workspace + environment: the provisioning block, folder contracts, env grants (S49).

A run that touches the filesystem needs to say WHERE, and the answer has to be a declaration rather
than a convention — Gideon has already been bitten by the alternative (the deleted-real-model
incident, where an in-place run's destructive step ran against real state).

Three things land, each deliberately built on machinery that already exists:

* **The `workspace` block** — `{mode, preserve_patterns, setup, teardown, env}`. Worktree mode
  reuses `loop/worktree.py` (`.worktrees/<id>` + `pclaw/task-*` branches), which is proven,
  rather than a second git implementation that would drift from it.
* **Folder contracts** (`.folder.yaml`) — validated as WARNINGS, never fatal, and unknown
  fields pass silently. That tolerance is the lesson of the 23-of-25-dropped-memories bug:
  a strict reader over a format that evolves discards the data it was meant to protect.
* **Per-project env grants** — the spawn env for a leaf is SECRET-FILTERED: only explicitly
granted
  keys reach a child. It extends the existing credential seam (`{{secret:KEY}}` + the credential
  store) rather than adding a second secret mechanism, and every surface shows presence flags only.

The asymmetries worth stating up front, because each fails in a chosen direction:

* **Setup failure does not block the run**; teardown failure does not block deletion. Setup is
  best-effort convenience — refusing to run because `npm install` failed would make the block a
  liability. But teardown runs BEFORE deletion, always, because its whole job is to stop
  services and
  sync artifacts out while the workspace still exists.
* **A reserved env var is REJECTED, not overridden.** Letting a run set `HOME` or `PATH`
is letting it
  redirect every subsequent tool invocation, including the ones that enforce the other rules here.
* **An ungranted secret is absent, not empty.** An empty string reads to a child as "this credential
  is configured and blank", which produces an authentication error instead of a missing-
  config error.

Pure functions over declarations. Provisioning I/O stays with the caller; this module decides.
