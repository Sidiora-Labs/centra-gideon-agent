"""The bundled-template definition provider — the batteries-included library (WF2 §6).

Ships inside the package (`workflows/bundled/<name>/workflow.json`), so a fresh
`pip install gideon` has a working template library with no network, no API key and no
first-run download. Same reasoning, and the same layout, as `skills/bundled/`.

**Read-only, and that is a design decision rather than a limitation.** A user who wants to
change a template instantiates it — which copies the spec into their own `defs/` — and edits
that. Writing through to the package directory would put a user's edit somewhere
`pip install --upgrade` silently overwrites, and the loss would be discovered long after the
upgrade that caused it.

**Macros are expanded on READ.** A template may be authored with `judge_panel` or
`research_sweep` for the same reason a user's spec may: the pattern is the readable form. But
what leaves this provider is always core nodes, so nothing downstream — the engine, the
journal, the resume cache, the widget — ever has to know macros exist. A template whose macro
cannot expand is dropped from the listing with a warning rather than breaking every other
template, because the listing is how a user finds the working ones.

There is no mtime sync. The old bundled-SOP pattern copied files into the user's home on boot,
which then needed a "did the user edit it?" story on every upgrade. Serving them from the
package instead means an upgrade ships new templates with no reconciliation at all.
