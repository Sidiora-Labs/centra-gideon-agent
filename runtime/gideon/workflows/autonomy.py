"""Autonomy and risk — approving a plan is not a boolean.

"Run it" and "run it unattended" are different grants, and the difference is not the user's
patience: it is what the plan can do while nobody is watching. So approval offers a MODE, and the
modes a plan may offer are governed by what its own nodes touch.

**One risk-signal registry, by reference.** Destructive ops, external writes, credentials and
payments, schedule creation. Cited from one place so the planner, the templates and the review
surface cannot drift into three different opinions about what "risky" means. It reuses the engine's
existing `RiskLevel` gradient rather than inventing a private vocabulary — a second one would drift
from the gradient the approval UI already renders.

**Floors cannot be silently lowered.** A template declares an `autonomy_floor`; neither the planner
nor the user can quietly go below it. A user CAN override, but the override costs exactly one
informed-consent question — never a silent honor, and never a silent upgrade either. Both silences
are failures: honoring "run unattended" on a plan that deletes production is the obvious one, and
quietly refusing it is the one that makes a user distrust the whole control.

**Everything compiles to `require_hitl`.** Node-level HITL/AFK typing, the risk registry and the
chosen mode all reduce to one flag the engine already knows how to honour. The plan's own risk note
is explicit: autonomy machinery that grew its own enforcement path would contradict the engine's
trust plumbing, so the compilation target is single by design.

**Two interrupts, and only two.** An unattended run stops for an irreversible action and for an
uninferable credential or payment detail. Everything else proceeds with a JOURNALED assumption —
because a run that stops for every ambiguity is not unattended, and one that proceeds without
recording what it assumed cannot be audited afterwards.

**The interrupt taxonomy ADVISES; it does not enforce.** `should_interrupt` answers "would
unattended stop here?" for the plan-review surface. Enforcement is `gate_policy.decide`, on the
engine's own `RiskLevel` × `OriginKind` vocabulary. That split is deliberate — see
`compile_require_hitl`: autonomy machinery that grew a second enforcement path would contradict the
engine's trust plumbing, so this module explains the trade and the engine makes it.
