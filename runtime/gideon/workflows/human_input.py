"""The human-input contract — `needs_input` as a durable cross-surface primitive (WF2-R7).

A gate that only exists inside a chat turn is useless to everything else. This module turns
"waiting for a human" into state that outlives the process, the surface, and the session:
the widget, the needs-input inbox, an HTTP call, and a chat tool all act on the same record.

Four things hold it together:

**A typed ask payload.** `{kind, prompt, fields, choices}` with `kind` in
approval|choice|text|form. One renderer covers every human-input node, and the same payload
projects into an inbox as a real form. Free-form asks would need per-template rendering,
which is how a "just add a prompt string" design becomes twelve half-broken UIs.

**A continuation record.** Each `needs_input` transition persists
`{node_id, instance_path, resolved_inputs, epoch, expires_at}` — so resuming re-enters THAT
step with the inputs it had already resolved, rather than re-executing the enclosing
subgraph. Without it, answering an approval an hour later silently redoes the work that led
up to the question.

**Atomic, single-use answers.** An answer is consumed by MOVING the record out of the
pending directory in the same step that applies it — one `os.rename`, which decides the
winner before anything is read. A double-resume (two clicks, a retried POST, a widget and
an inbox racing) must not replay the answer — replayed approvals are how one "yes" becomes
two deployments.

**Expiry is typed, never silent.** A stale token produces a `resume_expired` needs-input
item offering a re-run from the node. A dead token that simply does nothing is
indistinguishable from a bug, and the user is left clicking a button that has no effect.

Mode-dependent timeouts are the other half: a background run that waits forever on an
approval nobody will see is wedged, so background gates time out short and surface, while
blocking/chat-mode gates wait long because a human is right there.
