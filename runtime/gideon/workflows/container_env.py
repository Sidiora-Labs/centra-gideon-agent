"""Container workspace mode (WF2WOR-12 / WORK-R20) — the typed manifest and the backends.

Two halves, both deliberately small:

* **The manifest** (`parse_manifest`) — a typed declaration `{image XOR build, user, mounts,
  capabilities}` validated at parse time with the same `SpecIssue` vocabulary as
  `workspace.parse_workspace`, because a container that provisions from a malformed manifest
  fails at run time in a subprocess where the author cannot see the mistake.

* **The backends** (`detect_backend`) — Docker, containerd (via `nerdctl`) and Apple's
  `container` CLI on macOS, all driven by SHELLING OUT to the CLI the user already has.
  There is deliberately **no hard Docker dependency and no SDK import**: the plan's posture
  is local-first and opt-in, and an import-time dependency on `docker-py` would tax every
  install for a mode most runs never use. A machine with no backend at all keeps the
  existing graceful degradation in `provisioning._create_workspace` (isolated scratch dir,
  reason recorded) — a template that declares `mode: container` must stay RUNNABLE, just
  visibly not containerized.

**The engine owns runtime semantics** (§4.4): the workspace is always mounted at
:data:`WORKSPACE_MOUNT`, the entrypoint is overridden to an idle keep-alive so stages exec
into a stable container, and the working directory is the workspace mount. A manifest mount
targeting the reserved mount point is refused at parse time — silently shadowing the
workspace is the kind of misconfiguration that reports success while every stage writes
into a directory nobody will ever read.

**Snapshots** anchor fork-from-checkpoint to workspace state: `snapshot()` commits the
running container to an image ref recorded on the checkpoint, and a fork provisions the
child's container FROM that ref — the thing journal-only fork structurally cannot give a
code-kind run. A backend that cannot snapshot (Apple's CLI has no commit verb) says so in
its result rather than pretending; the checkpoint simply carries no anchor and fork falls
back to fresh provisioning, which is the pre-container behaviour and not an error.
