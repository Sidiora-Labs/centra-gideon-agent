"""Projecting a waiting run into the platform's attention surfaces (WF2-R7, WF2-R11).

A run that parks on `needs_input` is the one engine state whose resolution requires a human.
Until this module existed the only place that fact appeared was an SSE frame — so if nobody
happened to have the run view open, an approval gate waited silently forever. A scheduled run
firing at 3am would park and simply never be mentioned.

That is the gap this closes. A gate raises a **durable inbox item** plus **one** notification,
through `emit_attention_item` — the same seam the loop watchdog uses, for the same reason: a
caller that did `store.add(...)` and `state.notify(...)` separately drifts the two apart, and
the usual result is two notifications for one event or an inbox row nobody was told about.

Three properties this has to get right:

**Deduped per (run, node, epoch).** The watchdog re-polls a waiting run every few seconds and
`_ensure_continuation` is idempotent per epoch — so without a dedup key a gate would stack a
row per poll, each with a valid resume token. Keyed on the EPOCH rather than the token because
a rewind legitimately re-asks the same question, and that genuinely is a new ask.

**Resolved when answered.** An inbox row that stays open after its gate is answered is worse
than no row: the user clicks it, finds nothing to do, and stops trusting the inbox. The
resolution runs off the same `gate_resolved` moment the widget uses.

**Never load-bearing.** Every function here is best-effort and swallows. A run must not fail
because the inbox could not be written — the gate is what the user is waiting on, and losing
the run to a bookkeeping error is strictly worse than losing the row.
