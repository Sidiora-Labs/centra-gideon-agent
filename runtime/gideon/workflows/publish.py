"""Run outputs as Artifacts — the `publish:` declaration and its integrity rules (S47).

The adversarial review caught the original WORK-CONTAINERS draft inventing a second Artifact noun.
Gideon already has a first-class one (`artifacts/`: named, versioned to 50 snapshots,
project-scoped, event-logged, with REST routes and chat tools), so this module adds a
**declaration**
and its rules — never an entity.

What lands:

* **`publish: {artifact, kind}`** on a node, translated into a registry upsert at the same dispatch
  seam `required_artifacts` already uses. A refinement run UPDATES the same artifact by name, which
  is where the artifact's native versioning gives "stable name across revisions" for free.
* **Material-change gating.** The upsert refuses to create a new version when the content has not
  materially changed. Without it, a five-iteration refinement loop burns five of the fifty snapshots
  on identical bodies, and the window that exists to hold real history holds noise instead.
* **Typed lineage.** `SOURCE` → the run/node that produced it, `INFORMED_BY` → evidence and
knowledge
  items it read, `RELATED` → siblings. Typed rather than a flat list because "what made this" and
  "what this resembles" are different questions, and a reader following an untyped edge cannot tell
  which one they are answering.
* **Evidence bundles and the terminal handoff report** — both Artifact compositions, not new
nouns. A
  bundle is one manifest artifact listing what a run produced with a sha256 per file; the handoff
  report is the standardized contract every template's final node emits so the board can render
  "what happened while I slept" without per-template code.

Pure functions over dicts and content strings. The registry call is the caller's — `upsert_plan`
returns the decision (create / new version / no-op) and the payload, so the gating rules are
testable
without a filesystem.
