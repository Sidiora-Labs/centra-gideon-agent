"""Project as the sole work umbrella (WORK-CONTAINERS §1, §5.2, §6.1 — S46).

Project already exists and is already the right shape — named, briefed, owning a `context/` dir and
`worktrees/`, with protected `Personal`/`Repeatable` defaults. This module adds only what the run
engine needs from it, and deliberately adds no second umbrella noun: **no sub-projects, no
milestones, no org semantics.** That is the enterprise slope the plan names explicitly.

Three things land here:

* **Run→project binding.** Every run resolves a project, auto-creating one rather than allowing an
  orphan. The cost is one project row per orphan run, which is what loops already do.
* **Truthful lifecycle (§5.2).** The board must never lie after a crash. A run record is written
  BEFORE a concurrency slot is acquired, so `queued` is distinguishable from `running`; and the boot
  sweep checks whether the execution SUBSTRATE actually died before calling a run a zombie — a
  worktree run whose worktree survived a gateway restart is `suspended` with a Resume affordance,
  not aborted. Sweeping it would destroy recoverable work and report success.
* **Claim leases (§1.5).** Concurrent co-tenant sessions are real today, so a leaf a second worker
  could pick up needs an exclusive TTL'd claim. The lease is advisory-but-recorded: the holder is
  mirrored onto the row so the board can render the claim, which is the half that makes a stuck
  claim visible instead of mysterious.

The projections here are PURE — they take run records and return board rows. Storage stays in
`store.py`, project resolution in `projects.py`. That is what lets the "never lies" properties be
tested without a gateway.
