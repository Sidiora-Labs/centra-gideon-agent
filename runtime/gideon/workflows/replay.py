"""`workflow replay <run_id>` — re-drive a completed run's decision path and say where it moved.

This is the difference between a resume CACHE and a replay. The journal already serves cached
SUCCESS states on resume, but that only skips redoing work; it never asks *would this run take the
same path today?* — the question a template edit makes urgent and the one a resume cannot answer.
Replay asks it structurally: it re-drives the PURE :func:`~gideon.workflows.tick.frontier`
against the run's OWN recorded responses and diffs the resulting trajectory against the one the run
actually took, reporting the FIRST node where they part ways.

Nothing here is retrofitted onto the run — replay is possible because the nondeterminism envelope a
run depended on is already journaled:

* **provider responses** are spilled by `output_ref` (PP-4) — the recorded-response provider hands
  each node back its own recorded output, keyed by that ref, so downstream routing and downstream
  prompts see exactly what the run saw;
* **the resolved prompt** is stored by the controller's `_store_prompt` — so the ORIGINAL
  trajectory carries the prompt each node actually ran, and the replay re-resolves the prompt FRESH
  from the (possibly edited) spec and compares. A prompt edit shows up here and nowhere else;
* **the wall clock** is the one thing `frontier()` cannot supply — it is pure and reads no clock.
  The controller reads it in `_wake_due_nodes` and now journals that read as a `clock_read` event
  (PP-6). Replay resolves a parked node against that RECORDED clock, so a `wait` lands at the same
  point in the trajectory instead of against a live clock that could never match.

**Divergence is a first-class outcome, not a failure.** A template edit is SUPPOSED to diverge; the
verb's job is to name the first node that moved, not to fail. `replay_run` returns cleanly whether
the trajectory is byte-identical or divergent — the caller reads :attr:`ReplayResult.identical` and,
when it is False, :attr:`ReplayResult.first_divergence`.

This module lives on the workflow side, not under `gideon.ledger`: reconstructing a trajectory
needs node paths, epochs and `frontier()` — all workflow concepts — and the ledger package may not
import the engine (that seam is what lets a second producer carry a ledger). The ledger's job here
is the reader half: it stored the envelope; this reads it back.
