"""Pinned artifacts — the dashboard's pin list (WORK-CONTAINERS §6.5d, R13 — WF2WOR-7).

**Why a list and not a tile registry.** The dashboard has NO tile registry: the bento grid and
per-user layout persistence were deliberately retired, and widgets are hard-imported by
``DashboardPage.tsx``. So "pin to dashboard" is NOT a layout feature here. Pinning registers an
artifact slug in this list, and ONE hard-imported ``PinnedArtifacts`` widget renders it — the
established pattern (one component in ``pages/dashboard/widgets/``). Inventing a per-tile registry
to serve one feature would rebuild the exact machinery that was removed.

**The store** lives at ``entity_settings/pinned_artifacts.json``, via the shared entity-settings
helpers, following the ``channel_trust`` precedent: user/entity state belongs in
``entity_settings/*.json``, never in ``config.json``.

**A pin holds a REFERENCE, never a copy.** It stores the slug and when it was pinned — not the
artifact's name or content. A denormalized copy would go stale the moment the artifact was renamed
or revised, and a dashboard widget showing a title the artifact no longer has is worse than one
showing nothing: it is confidently wrong. The widget resolves each slug through the artifacts API
at render time, which is also how a DELETED artifact self-heals off the surface.

**Order is the user's, not the clock's.** Pins render newest-first because that is what a pin
means here — "I care about this now" — and re-pinning an already-pinned slug MOVES it rather than
duplicating it. A list that could hold one slug twice would render two identical cards.
