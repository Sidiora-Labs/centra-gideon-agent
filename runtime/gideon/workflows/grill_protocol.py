"""The structured `rigor: deep` interrogation protocol (UP-R5, S45).

The existing :mod:`gideon.grill` pipeline stays exactly as it is — it is the vendor-neutral
`assess → recall → decompose → save` machinery, and this module is the planner's protocol ON TOP of
it, not a replacement. What the protocol adds is everything that makes deep grilling fast rather
than tedious:

* **Every question ships with the planner's recommended answer.** A question with no default is a
  question the user must think about from nothing; a question with one they can accept is a
  confirmation. This is the single largest difference between a grill a user finishes and one they
  abandon halfway.
* **Facts are LOOKED UP, not asked.** A question whose answer is already discoverable — in the
  codebase, in the knowledge store, in memory — is a question that makes the system look like it
  has not been paying attention. The split is mechanical here: a question is routed to a lookup
  channel or it is asked, never both.
* **The channels are never conflated.** Memory recall and knowledge search are two subsystems with
  two different lifecycles, and a merged "context fetch" would make it impossible to say which one
  answered. They are separate callables with separate result provenance, per the plan's boundary
  note.
* **Prohibitions are frozen.** A Stop/never-do answer that could be re-litigated by a later stage
  is not a boundary, it is a suggestion. Once captured it is injected verbatim into every stage's
  worker context.

The protocol is PURE: no LLM call, no I/O, no clock. Rounds are built, answers are folded in, and
the Step-0 schema is derived — the caller owns asking and looking up. That is what makes the
asymmetries below testable at all.
