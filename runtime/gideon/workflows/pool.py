"""Task-pool concurrency: leases, evented unblock, hand-offs, blueprints (TASKS-SOPS §5 R10 — S60).

PClaw already runs concurrent co-tenant sessions and batch `subagent_run` children sharing one task
pool. What the pool lacked was concurrency SEMANTICS — three of them:

* **A ranked projection over ALL tasks** — `frontier` (everything unblocked, ranked) and `next` (the
  one top task). RETIRED HERE by `PP-13`: it lives on the unified admission core as
  `admission.ready` / `admission.next_ready`, where the ordering is `admission.rank_key` and the
  leased-work exclusion is the composed `Lease` policy rather than a private `if`. The lease
  DECISION functions below are that policy's implementation and stay — only the second projection
  went, because a scheduler implemented twice decides differently exactly once and then lies.
* **TTL'd lease claims.** Without compare-and-swap leases, engine-projected tasks WILL be
  double-executed by concurrent sessions. The claim is a `os.rename`-class primitive, not a
  read-then-write: S57 measured `unlink`-based single-use failing 36 of 40 races, and a lease that
  loses a race is worse than no lease because both holders believe they own the work.
* **Evented unblock.** A completed task must unblock its dependents; a FAILED one must cascade
  `blocked(kind=dependency_failed)` carrying the blocker's reason. Before this, only
  workflow-bound tasks got unblocked (via `frontier()`), so a standalone dependent sat
  misleadingly `open` after its prerequisite died — the board lied about what was workable.

Measured before building (S60):

* **`TaskComplete` is a declared hook event that NOTHING fires.** It is in `HOOK_EVENTS`, it is
  allowlisted in `validation.py::ALLOWED_HOOK_EVENTS`, and the hook UI renders it — so a user can
  configure "when a task finishes" and get nothing. `validation.py` says so itself: "the rest are
  reserved for future firing sites and currently never trigger". This module supplies the payload
  and the edge-trigger rule that make it fireable. The plan's `TaskCreated` is NOT a shipped event
  name; adding one here would create a vocabulary the hook UI does not render, so task creation
  stays out until the event is declared where users can see it.
* **Acyclicity is ALREADY enforced server-side** by `tasks/native.py` via
  `reconcile.would_create_cycle` on both create and update. The plan's "the server-side write path
  adds the authoritative check" is already true — so this module reuses that function for the
  pool's edge-planning rather than adding a second cycle checker that could disagree with it.

    otherwise a race between the read and the write. A LOSER of the lock is told the task is held
    rather than proceeding: single-flight means don't double-run, and a caller that ignored the miss
    would be doing exactly the double-claim the lock exists to prevent.

    That lock covers THREADS as well as processes (flock is per open file description and
    `single_flight` opens a fresh one per call), which is the property `PP-12`'s `Lease` admission
    policy rests on: the engine fans out in-process with `asyncio.create_task`, so a cross-process-
    only claim would not cap the fan-out shape that actually occurs. Measured both ways — 16 threads
    on one resource yield exactly one holder with this wrapper, and 3 to 15 holders without it.
