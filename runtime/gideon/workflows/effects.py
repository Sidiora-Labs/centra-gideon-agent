"""The effect ledger — external side effects get identity, status, and a teardown path.

The journal cache memoizes *outputs* only. Without effect identity, resume/rewind/fork
double-fire external effects — a Slack message sent twice, a task created twice, a VM
provisioned twice. That is the biggest correctness hole in a journaled-replay design
(WF2-R1), and this module is the fix: every side-effecting `action` dispatch records a
typed effect event in `events.jsonl`, keyed by an idempotency key derived from the
execution identity, not the wall clock.

Three rules the controller enforces with what lives here:

* **A committed effect is a boundary.** Re-executing a node whose effect COMMITTED in a
  previous epoch requires an explicit `redo_effects: true` on the node — silently
  re-running it is exactly the double-fire this ledger exists to prevent. (The mutation
  cascade preview that *surfaces* the boundary before a rewind is Slice 4's job; the
  runtime refusal is this slice's.)
* **Teardown before redo.** A provisioning effect that declared a `teardown` command gets
  it run — with the committed output id — before the region re-executes. The BYOI
  contract requires teardown to be idempotent, so running it against an already-gone
  resource is safe.
* **Callers get dedupe.** `workflow_start`/`workflow_edit` accept a caller idempotency
  key with a short-lived cache, so a retried chat tool call returns the existing run id
  instead of minting a second run (the tool surface lands in Slice 6; the cache is
  built and tested here so the seam exists).
