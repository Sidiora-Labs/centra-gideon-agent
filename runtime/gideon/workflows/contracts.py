"""Stage contracts and derived parameters — what a plan review is actually reviewing.

Two mechanisms that both replace a hand-maintained artifact with a derived one, for the same
reason: a hand-maintained artifact drifts, and the drift is silent.

**Derived parameters (UP-R8).** A template's `inputs` block stops being the source of truth.
`resolve_unfilled_inputs()` computes the parameter schema as "what the tree references and nothing
supplies", so the launch form and the spec cannot disagree. Measured on the shipped library: THREE
of eighteen templates declared an input nothing read — including one where a user could set
`apply: true` on a consolidation pass and watch the node run with `apply: false`, no effect and no
error.

**Stage contracts (UP-R3).** Per-stage `scope` / `done_means` / `exclusions`, because approving "a
plan" approves a shape while approving a contract approves a claim. The rule that carries the
weight: **goal / verification / stopping-condition is the minimal triple**, and a stage with no
derivable check is marked unverifiable rather than quietly accepted — an unverifiable stage that
looks verified is how a run reports success for work nobody checked.

**Decision typing (UP-R16).** Blocking decisions pause the run and enter the needs-input inbox;
non-blocking ones land as Open Decisions on the finished summary. The auto-classification rule is
mechanical: a decision whose output feeds a downstream binding is BLOCKING, because the run cannot
proceed correctly without it; ambiguity that changes no execution path is not.
