"""Project archive I/O: the ZIP writer and extractor around ``project_export``'s planning (S54, C9).

``project_export`` is the DECISION layer — what travels, what it hashes to, what an import may
accept. It deliberately takes file CONTENTS rather than a directory so the exclusion and digest
rules are testable without a project on disk. That left the whole module with **no importer**: a
complete export planner exports nothing until something reads a project off the filesystem, writes
a ZIP, and extracts one back. This is that half, and nothing more — every policy question is still
answered next door.

Three rules this module owns, and why each is here rather than there:

* **Extraction goes to a UNIQUE temp directory, never a shared one.** Two concurrent imports into
  one scratch path would let the second overwrite the first's members between the digest check and
  the read — the same TOCTOU shape the extraction filter exists to close, reintroduced one level up.
* **The temp directory is removed on EVERY exit path**, fault included. A quarantine that survives
  a failed import leaves the archive's contents unpacked on disk after the import that would have
  vetted them refused; `packs/import_.py` uses exactly this `try/finally` shape.
* **Path safety runs at EXTRACTION time**, not only at plan time. `project_export.safe_member` is
  the readable half and runs first; this module applies the same predicate again per member as it
  writes, because a plan-time scan is a promise about a list and extraction is what touches the
  filesystem.

Encryption is OPTIONAL and off by default. An encrypted archive is a file the user cannot read
without the passphrase they chose, which is a real way to lose a project — so plaintext stays the
default and the encrypted form is asked for explicitly.
