"""Retry intelligence, the circuit breaker, and budget accounting.

Three mechanisms that all answer one question — *when should the engine stop spending?* —
and one that answers *how should it spend the next attempt better?*

**Mutation-hint retries (WF2-R4).** A blind retry re-sends the identical prompt and
reproduces the identical failure; the measured difference is stark (hints resolved 7/10
failures on attempt 2 where blind retries resolved ~0). So an attempt is a first-class
record, and retry N+1 receives a correction hint keyed to the failure MODE plus a pruned
digest of what already failed. The digest is pruned deliberately: pasting three full
failed transcripts back into a prompt spends the context that was supposed to fix it.

**The circuit breaker (WF2-R4).** Deterministic and LLM-free, because the failure it
catches — a loop thrashing on the same error forever — is the field's #1 autonomous-run
failure mode, and paying a model to notice it would be both slower and less reliable. It
trips on: iteration cap, N identical error signatures, M byte-identical outputs, or
cumulative token spend. Tripping produces `ESCALATED`, which is deliberately NOT `FAILED`:
"I gave up and need a human" is a different fact from "this broke", and collapsing them
loses the distinction a user needs to act.

**Budgets are SOFT (WF2-R4).** A breach pauses resumably. Killing the run would throw away
completed work the user already paid for; pausing lets them extend and continue. The
pre-charge invariant is what keeps that safe — a resumed run inherits its ledger spend, so
a crash loop cannot mint a fresh budget on every restart.
