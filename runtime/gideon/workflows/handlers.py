"""HTTP handlers for `/api/workflows` — the REST surface over the v2 engine.

Every handler delegates to `workflows.service`, the SAME module the chat tools call. That
is the whole design: two surfaces over one engine must not grow two behaviours, and "the
tool did X but the API did Y" is a bug class this avoids by construction rather than by
keeping two implementations in sync by hand.

Three conventions this file follows from the surrounding code:

* **The HTTP error envelope is `{"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}}` with a
  lowercase_snake code** (INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE §2.2), which is a DIFFERENT vocabulary
  from the service layer's `WF_*` codes — those are for an LLM reading a tool result, these
  are for a browser branching on a status. `_fail` maps one to the other in one place so
  they cannot drift.
* **Mutations are gated against restricted (incognito/guest) sessions and SEL-audited**,
  matching the artifacts/tasks handlers. A workflow run spends money and touches the world;
  an unaudited start is worse than an unaudited read.
* **The per-run SSE stream is snapshot-then-subscribe.** A client that subscribed first
  would miss everything between connect and the first event, and a terminal run closes
  immediately rather than holding a connection open forever for events that will never come.
