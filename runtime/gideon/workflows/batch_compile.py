"""Batch `subagent_run` compiled to a run, with the hardening contract (WORK-CONTAINERS §3, S48).

Today a batch spawn is fire-and-forget: no journal, no per-branch retry, no resume after restart, no
fork. Compiling `tasks[]` into an inline `parallel[stage...]` run gives it all of those for free —
same tool signature, so no agent-visible migration.

The threshold rule is the whole ergonomic story: **N=1 stays a raw spawn, N≥2 compiles.** Ad-hoc "go
check X while I keep chatting" is chat-native delegation, and forcing a run record plus project
resolution onto it is ceremony that kills the personal feel.

What the compiled run ships with (R2):

* **Isolation by default**, with a compile-time lint that warns when more than one concurrent worker
  holds write access to the same path. Two workers writing one file is a lost update, and it is
  invisible: both report success.
* **Dual depth enforcement** — statically (a batch inside a batch is rejected at compile) and
  dynamically (the `__wf_depth` counter the engine already carries). Today's no-recursion rule is
  PROMPT-level only, so a leaf that decided to fan out again could do it.
* **Capability classes.** A leaf declares `research` or `mutating`; research leaves get a read-only
  tool surface. A research leaf with write tools is a leaf that can only surprise you.
* **Typed leaf outputs**, compiled into the engine's EXISTING `output_contract` rather than a second
  checker — two validators over one field would disagree eventually, and the one that fired last
  would win silently.
* **Per-leaf error isolation.** One leaf failing never rejects the batch: the whole point of five
  parallel investigations is that four still return.

**The leaf CONTRACT is the load-bearing artifact, not the leaf's identity (amendment (b), C2.1).**
Every leaf declares three things and none of them are optional: an **objective**, a declared
**output format**, and a **boundary** — what it must not touch. The evidence review behind the
amendment is why: across 1,642 annotated traces, "disobey role specification" is the 2nd-RAREST of
14 failure modes (1.5%) while specification drift is 11.8% and verification ~23.5%, and the one
place a "roles help" result survived scrutiny it was the differing INSTRUCTIONS doing the work
(ChatEval's identical-role arm scored exactly the single-agent number). So the compile refuses an
under-specified leaf and spends nothing on who the leaf is pretending to be.

All three declarations ride into the leaf's own PROMPT. That is not decoration: the engine's
`output_contract` REJECTS off-format output, and a contract the worker was never shown is a gate
that fails every single time. Same for the boundary — a boundary nobody told the worker about is a
compile-time comment.

**`boundary` is not `writes`, and conflating them would lose both.** `writes` is a POSITIVE
declaration (the paths this leaf will write) and exists for the compiler to detect SIBLING
collisions — it is coordination data between leaves. `boundary` is a NEGATIVE declaration (what
this leaf must not touch) and exists for the WORKER — it is instruction content, the active
ingredient the evidence points at. They are duals, not complements: an empty `writes` does not mean
"the boundary is everything", and a boundary says nothing about what the rest of the tree may
receive. They meet in exactly one place — a leaf that declares a write INSIDE its own boundary has
declared it will do the thing it declared it must not do, which is a contradiction only the author
can resolve, so the compile refuses it (`boundary_contradicts_writes`).

**Homogeneous by default, heterogeneous by MODEL only (amendment (a)).** A leaf inherits the
parent's agent binding unless it pins one, and may pin a different `model` — the single measured
heterogeneity win in the literature (up to 44% accuracy at matched cost). There is deliberately NO
persona/role field on `LeafTask`: the best-powered direct test of personas (162 roles, 4 model
families, 2,410 questions) found no improvement with per-persona effects "largely random", and
persona churn is bidirectional (one measured case fixed 4% while breaking 18%), which is strictly
worse than a uniform loss for an autonomous system because it destroys reproducibility.

**Writes stay single-threaded (amendment (c), C2.2).** `mutating` leaves are serialized against each
other WITHIN the run by a `needs` chain, so two of them can never be in flight together, while
research leaves stay fully parallel. Measured against the real frontier rather than assumed: a
`needs` predecessor satisfies its edge once it is TERMINAL (done, failed or skipped alike), so a
failed mutating leaf hands the lane to the next one instead of stranding the chain — which is what
keeps serialization from quietly becoming a second way for one bad leaf to sink the batch.

Pure compilation. `compile_batch` takes leaf contracts and returns a spec plus lint findings; the
caller starts the run.
