"""Batch `subagent_run` compiled to a run, with the hardening contract (WORK-CONTAINERS §3, S48).

Today a batch spawn is fire-and-forget: no journal, no per-branch retry, no resume after restart, no
fork. Compiling `tasks[]` into an inline `parallel[stage...]` run gives it all of those for free —
same tool signature, so no agent-visible migration.

The threshold rule is the whole ergonomic story: **N=1 stays a raw spawn, N≥2 compiles.** Ad-hoc "go
check X while I keep chatting" is chat-native delegation, and forcing a run record plus project
resolution onto it is ceremony that kills the personal feel.

What the compiled run ships with (R2):

* **Isolation by default**, with a compile-time lint that warns when more than one concurrent worker
  holds write access to the same path. Two workers writing one file is a lost update, and it is
  invisible: both report success.
* **Dual depth enforcement** — statically (a batch inside a batch is rejected at compile) and
  dynamically (the `__wf_depth` counter the engine already carries). Today's no-recursion rule is
  PROMPT-level only, so a leaf that decided to fan out again could do it.
* **Capability classes.** A leaf declares `research` or `mutating`; research leaves get a read-only
  tool surface. A research leaf with write tools is a leaf that can only surprise you.
* **Typed leaf outputs**, compiled into the engine's EXISTING `output_contract` rather than a second
  checker — two validators over one field would disagree eventually, and the one that fired last
  would win silently.
* **Per-leaf error isolation.** One leaf failing never rejects the batch: the whole point of five
  parallel investigations is that four still return.

Pure compilation. `compile_batch` takes task descriptions and returns a spec plus lint findings; the
caller starts the run.
