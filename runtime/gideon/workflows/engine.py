"""Node dispatchers — the only place in the engine that performs real work.

One function per node kind, each with the same contract: take a resolved node and a
binding context, do the work, return a `NodeResult`. Dispatchers do NOT write state and
do NOT decide what runs next — the controller owns both. Keeping that split means a
dispatcher can be tested by calling it, with no run, no lock, and no journal.

Two asymmetries here are deliberate and easy to get backwards:

**A null output is a value; an unresolvable reference is an error (WF2-R9).** A node that
legitimately produced nothing hands `None` downstream, and `filter`/`default` pipes exist
to absorb it. But a binding naming something that does not exist raises `BindingError` —
because the silent alternative is a prompt with an empty hole in it, which produces
confident nonsense that looks like a real answer. That failure must be loud.

**`stage` and `infer` are different kinds for a real reason.** A `stage` is a subagent
with tools and a session — expensive, capable, and able to spawn. An `infer` is exactly
one bounded model call with no tools and no session. Templates that just need a
classification should not pay for a subagent, and the lane accounting depends on
distinguishing them.

Model resolution goes through the `model_tiers` slot map: a node declares an intent
(`reasoning`/`standard`/`fast`), config maps intents to use cases, and the existing
use-case bridge resolves the actual model. A template never names a model — that is what
keeps a template portable across a user's provider setup.
