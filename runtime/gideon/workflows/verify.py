"""Engine-owned completion — the ladder, the verdict enum, and artifact gates.

One rule generates this whole module: **no agent certifies its own work.**

That is not a stylistic preference. Agent-declared completion is systematically
overconfident, and the studied intervention is dramatic — gating on an independent pass
state moved one case from 37.5% to 87.5% real completion. So a stage may only *request* a
transition; the engine executes the declared verification and flips the state.

Three mechanisms enforce it:

**A no-skip ladder.** Checks run static → runtime → system, and a hard failure at any rung
fails the gate outright. Deliberately NOT averaged: averaging lets a confident model pass a
gate it structurally failed, which is precisely the failure being prevented.

**A closed verdict enum**, owned by `judge_contract` and imported here (WF2LOO-13). This
module used to define a SECOND `Verdict` — PASS/RETRY/ESCALATE/REJECT against the contract's
PASS/REJECT/REPLAN/ESCALATE/NEEDS_INPUT — and two vocabularies over one decision is why the
engine had to restate the judge aggregation rule instead of importing it. The sets were
merged into the contract's and this one deleted; `RETRY` moved across because it was the only
member the merge would otherwise have lost. A judge returns one of those values and nothing
else, so the scheduler routes on DATA rather than parsing prose. Parsing "I think this looks
mostly fine?" into a control-flow decision is how an engine becomes unpredictable.

**The fresh-judge invariant.** A gate judging output runs in a session distinct from the
node that produced it; `self_judge: true` is explicit opt-in. Without the separation the
judge inherits the producer's reasoning and rubber-stamps it.

`required_artifacts` closes the matching hole for non-LLM work: a node claiming to have
written files does not complete until the files exist. The verifier must read where the
worker writes, which is why the run workspace is passed in rather than assumed.
