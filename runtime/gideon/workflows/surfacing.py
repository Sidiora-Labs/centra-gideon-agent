"""Semantic surfacing engine for workflows (E4-P2) — the net-new core.

Given the current turn's identities (a :class:`TurnScope`) and the user's
message, find the single best-matching workflow SOP to inject as guidance:

1. **Scope gate** (:func:`eligible_workflows`) — collect every workflow eligible
   for this turn (global always; workspace by cwd; agent by reference; session
   by key), enabled-only.
2. **Semantic rank** (:func:`best_match`) — embed the query, score eligible
   candidates by cosine vs their cached ``match_embedding``, return the single
   best above threshold. Degrades to keyword word-overlap when no embedding
   model is active or a candidate's embedding is missing/stale.
3. **Inject** (:func:`render_injection`) — render the winner as a guidance block.

Embedding is reused via ``embedding_providers.registry.get_active_embed_fn``
(a sync ``(text) -> list[float] | None``), so this whole module stays sync
except the registry fan-out (async). No ``build_message`` signature change is
needed (OD#6). The match is never allowed to break a turn — callers wrap it.
