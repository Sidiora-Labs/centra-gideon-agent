"""``on_overlap`` — the three policies' decision, and the queue `queue` needs to exist.

`OverlapPolicy.QUEUE` shipped as the exact OPPOSITE of its name (WV-14). The provider
compared against `SKIP` (return early) and `CANCEL_PREVIOUS` (cancel the priors, then
start) and let `queue` fall through to `store.create` + `_launch` — so the one policy
whose name promises ORDERING started a second run **beside** the still-running first one,
silently. A per-minute trigger against a slow workflow stacked runs without bound, which
is the precise hazard `OverlapPolicy`'s own docstring says the default exists to prevent.

Three things live here, in one module, because they are one decision:

**The decision is pure and exhaustive.** `decide()` names every member of the closed enum
and its unreachable tail RAISES rather than defaulting. A fourth member added tomorrow
would otherwise inherit whichever branch happened to be written last — which is exactly
how `QUEUE` inherited "start now".

**The queue is a marked DRAFT run, not a new status.** A queued start creates the run
record and its spec and then does NOT launch it. `RunStatus.DRAFT` is where an unlaunched
run already lives, so no state-machine member (and no frontend status mapping) has to
change. But DRAFT is also where a user's hand-made, deliberately-unstarted editor draft
sits, so the drain MUST NOT treat "DRAFT for this def" as "launch me": queued-ness is a
marker on the run record (`extra[QUEUED_KEY]`), and `extra` is a persisted JSON column, so
the marker survives a restart exactly as the row does. A DRAFT with no marker is never
touched by the drain — starting work a user never asked to start is the worst available
outcome of this atom, so it is the thing a test pins directly.

**The drain is single-flight and idempotent.** It reuses `concurrency.single_flight` (the
flock the claim leases are built on) rather than inventing a lock: two runs of the same def
finishing at once, or a restart landing mid-drain, must not launch the same queued run
twice or launch two at once. Three independent guards, in cheapest-first order: the flock,
the supervisor's own controller registry (`launch` is already idempotent per run id), and
the "is anything active for this def" re-check INSIDE the lock.

**The queue is capped at one, and a drop is loud.** See `MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH`.
