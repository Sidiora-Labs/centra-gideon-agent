"""The workflow watchdog — crash recovery and the supervisor poll.

A controller drives a run only while its process lives. The watchdog covers everything
that outlives a process: a gateway killed mid-run, a stage subagent that finished after
its controller died, a cancel issued while the gateway was down.

Its job is narrow by design. It does NOT schedule nodes — that is the controller's, and
having two schedulers is how a run gets two writers. The watchdog decides only *which
runs need a controller*, then hands off.

Three responsibilities:

**Adoption.** At startup, every run the store thinks is live has no controller. Each is
adopted: a fresh controller resumes from the journal, and completed nodes come back as
cache hits rather than re-running. Without this a gateway restart silently abandons runs
in RUNNING forever — the state a user reads as "still working" while nothing is.

**Orphan reaping.** A run whose nodes are all terminal but whose status never got written
(the process died between the last node and the terminal write) is finished off from its
derived outcome. This is the one place a terminal status is written outside a tick loop,
and it is safe precisely because there is no controller: adoption comes first, so a run
with a live controller is never reaped.

**Sticky cancel.** A CANCEL file is honoured even for a run with no controller.
