"""``SupervisorPolicy`` — a loop's convergence policy, declared (PP-14) and WIRED (PP-15).

A loop is not a second engine. **A loop is a graph shape plus a supervisor policy.** The
shape already exists (`loop` node kind, `LoopMode`, `foreach` with `max_concurrency`); the
POLICY had no home, which is why it got implemented twice with each side missing what the
other had — `loop/` carries the marginal-value band and reproduce-before-ship, while
`workflows/` carries the pre-tier, the proof precondition, the actor matrix and the
five-rung escalation ladder. This module is the ONE declaration those two halves converge
on: it reuses the types that already exist (`RubricCriterion` and `clamp_marginal` from
`judge_contract`, `Rung`/`FailureClass` from `loop_middleware`, `StepConfig` from
`loop.tick`, `Attention` from `autonomy`, `ScopeMode` from `scope`) rather than minting a
parallel vocabulary.

WIRED — this module now has a production caller.
===============================================
It used to parse and validate while nothing in the engine read a ``SupervisorPolicy``, and it
said so. PP-15 was named as the wiring owner and is that caller:
``RunController._supervisor_policy`` parses a loop node's ``supervisor:`` block, and
:func:`tick_config` turns it into the ``TickConfig`` that ``loop.tick.evaluate`` — the ONE
convergence core, now shared by the workflow ``loop`` node and the loop kinds — reads. The
thresholds a template declares here are the thresholds the engine applies; the per-kind Python
that supplied them twice (``loop_middleware.check_middleware``) is deleted.

The honesty-marker convention (`WF2LOO-12`) is what tracked that transition: **a control with
no caller must SAY it has no caller** — and must stop saying it once it has one.
``HAS_ZERO_PRODUCTION_CALLERS`` is now ``False``, and
``tests/test_workflows_validator_supervisor.py`` rails the claim against reality in BOTH drift
directions, so it can never quietly disagree with the code:

* if the last production caller disappears while this marker still claims one, the rail goes
  RED (the module became inert again without saying so); and
* if the marker claims zero while a caller exists, the rail goes RED (the old lie).

A "production caller" is code outside this module and outside ``tests/`` that CONSTRUCTS a
``SupervisorPolicy`` or invokes :func:`parse_supervisor_policy` — i.e. code that wires the
policy into runtime behaviour. The authoring-time validator in ``workflows/validator.py``
consults the closed field set below to emit ``WF_SUPERVISOR_*`` codes; consulting the
contract is not invoking the policy, so it is not a caller.
