"""``SupervisorPolicy`` — the declaration of a loop's convergence policy (PP-14).

A loop is not a second engine. **A loop is a graph shape plus a supervisor policy.** The
shape already exists (`loop` node kind, `LoopMode`, `foreach` with `max_concurrency`); the
POLICY had no home, which is why it got implemented twice with each side missing what the
other had — `loop/` carries the marginal-value band and reproduce-before-ship, while
`workflows/` carries the pre-tier, the proof precondition, the actor matrix and the
five-rung escalation ladder. This module is the ONE declaration those two halves converge
on: it reuses the types that already exist (`RubricCriterion` and `clamp_marginal` from
`judge_contract`, `Rung`/`FailureClass` from `loop_middleware`, `StepConfig` from
`loop.tick`, `Attention` from `autonomy`, `ScopeMode` from `scope`) rather than minting a
parallel vocabulary.

DELIBERATELY INERT — this module has **zero production callers**.
================================================================
It parses and it validates; nothing in the engine reads a ``SupervisorPolicy`` yet. **PP-15
is the wiring owner** — it widens `loop/tick.evaluate` into the single convergence brain and
makes ``SupervisorPolicy`` the source of the thresholds `evaluate` reads. Until PP-15 lands,
no ``frontier()``, no controller and no loop kind may call this: a convergence decision wired
into the engine before its home is widened would mint the very second brain this program
exists to retire.

This is the honesty-marker convention this program established (`WF2LOO-12`): **a control
with no caller must SAY it has no caller.** The claim is railed in BOTH drift directions by
``tests/test_workflows_validator_supervisor.py``:

* if a production caller of ``SupervisorPolicy`` appears while this marker still claims zero,
  the rail goes RED (the marker would be lying); and
* if this marker is removed while callers are still zero, the rail goes RED (an inert control
  that has stopped declaring itself inert).

A "production caller" is code outside this module and outside ``tests/`` that CONSTRUCTS a
``SupervisorPolicy`` or invokes :func:`parse_supervisor_policy` — i.e. code that wires the
policy into runtime behaviour. The authoring-time validator in ``workflows/validator.py``
consults the closed field set below to emit ``WF_SUPERVISOR_*`` codes; consulting the
contract is not invoking the policy, so it is not a caller.
