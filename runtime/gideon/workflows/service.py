"""Workflow operations — the ONE implementation the chat tools and HTTP routes share.

Every workflow operation lives here as a plain function returning a plain dict. The chat
tools (Slice 6a) call it in-process; the REST handlers (Slice 7a) will call the same
functions and serialize the same dicts. That is deliberate: two surfaces over one engine
must not grow two behaviours, and "the tool did X but the API did Y" is the bug class this
prevents by construction.

Three rules the shape follows:

**Never raise across the boundary.** Every function returns `{"ok": bool, ...}` with a
stable `code` on failure. A tool call that raises burns the model's turn on a traceback it
cannot act on; a coded error it can read and correct.

**The supervisor is injected, never imported from a global.** A run needs a controller to
drive it, and that controller must be the one the watchdog knows about — otherwise a
restart adopts the run a second time and two writers race. Callers pass the supervisor;
tests pass a fake.

**Reads never mutate.** `status`/`output`/`observe` construct no controller and start no
run. A read that lazily started something would make polling a side-effecting act.

    *produced* (`output`, or an `artifact_ref` when the value was offloaded), how many tries
    it took (`attempts`), the ledger slice that records the trajectory (`ledger_events`),

    an unknown run/node is a 404 (nothing to show), a node that exists but has not reached a

    redact), so this dict is NOT safe to emit as-is. Redaction is the HTTP surface's job

    UNDER the run dir, so the `rmtree` below would take it out; running teardown after that would
    execute `docker compose down` against a path that no longer holds the compose file. The one
    caller (`handlers.api_run_delete`) is already async.

    `keep_open` is the §4.1 override for when the workspace IS the deliverable: the run row and
    directory go, the workspace stays. Teardown still runs — keeping the directory is not keeping
