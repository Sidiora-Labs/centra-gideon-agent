"""Workspace provisioning I/O — the performer for S49's plan and S52's decisions (WF2WOR-4).

S49 shipped `workspace.plan_provisioning` and S52 shipped `worktrees.pending_setup` /
`plan_teardown`, both deliberately pure: they decide, and the caller performs. Neither had a
production caller, which made the whole §4.1 mechanism a declared-but-inert layer — a run's
`workspace:` block was parsed nowhere, so every run silently ran in place regardless of what its
template declared. This module is the performer, and `controller._prepare` is its caller.

Three things are structural rather than incidental:

* **Order is the contract.** preserve → setup → run, and teardown → commit → delete. Both halves
  are enforced HERE rather than trusted to the caller, because the failure of either is silent:
  an `npm install` that runs before `.npmrc` is copied in reaches the wrong registry, and a
  teardown that runs after deletion reports success against a directory that no longer holds the
  services it was meant to stop.
* **The lock lives OUTSIDE the workspace.** A lock file inside a worktree would be deleted by
  the very teardown whose contention it guards, and would be invisible to a second process
  deciding whether the first is alive. It rides `concurrency.lock_path` (the same sanitized-
  prefix-plus-digest convention every other Gideon lock uses) with a PID line, so a stale holder
  self-heals on a `os.kill(pid, 0)` probe rather than wedging the run forever.
* **Setup NEVER blocks the run; teardown NEVER blocks deletion.** Both asymmetries are S49/S52
  contracts (`SetupResult.blocked_run` is False by construction) and both are honored by
  recording the failure and continuing. A setup block that could fail a run would be a liability
  to declare, and a user would stop declaring it.

Every subprocess goes through `effects.run_teardown`'s exact pattern — `shlex.split` (no shell),
the binary resolved up front for a typed not-found, and `sandbox.create_subprocess_limited` with
`PROFILE_TOOL` so the ceiling arrives via the post-exec shim. Never `preexec_fn`: a forked
`preexec_fn` in this threaded gateway wedges the event loop.
