"""Every `Loop` field's home on a `WorkflowRun` + `SupervisorPolicy` (PP-16, step 1).

`loop_aliases` answers the NOUN question at the type level — a loop *kind* resolves to a bundled
template. This module answers it at the FIELD level, which is the half that decides whether the
noun change is a migration or a silent feature deletion. The plan's own first implementation step
says it plainly: *"Map every field of the `Loop` row onto `WorkflowRun` + `SupervisorPolicy`, and
name the ones with no home BEFORE writing code — an unmapped field is a feature about to be dropped
silently."* This is that map, in the same idiom `supervisor_policy.POLICY_KNOB_MAP` established for
AG-13's fourteen knobs: one row per field, the destination as a resolvable path, and a test that
resolves every one so a rename on either side reds rather than rots.

**Deliberately inert, and it says so.** Nothing reads this at runtime, and it constructs no run.
It is a DECLARATION, railed in both drift directions (`tests/test_pp16_loop_field_map.py`) — the
honesty marker this program established in `WF2LOO-12` and reused for `PP-14`. The wiring owner is
PP-16's later sessions; this exists so those sessions inherit a measured map instead of re-deriving
it per field, and so the six fields with NO home are an owner decision taken in daylight rather
than a discovery made after `loop/store.py` is gone.

**What the map is measured against, not guessed from.** Each `RUN_INPUT` row names a parameter a
BUNDLED template actually declares (the rail re-reads the shipped `workflow.json` files, so a
template that renames its input reds this), each `RUN`/`POLICY`/`DEF`/`INTENT` row names a real
dataclass field (the rail resolves the dotted path), and each `NONE` row carries the measurement
that established it has no home.

**Three findings this map surfaced, recorded here because they are the expensive half of PP-16:**

1. **A run has no user-facing title.** The runs list labels a row ``{workflow_name} — run {id}``
   (`web/src/pages/workflows/WorkflowsListPage.tsx:372`). `Loop.name` — shown on every loop
   surface, and user-editable via `store.rename` — has nowhere to live. `WorkflowRun.extra` is a
   tolerant-reader spillover dict, not a declared field, so parking a first-class user-visible
   string there is a shape decision, not a migration detail.
2. **The status vocabularies are not a superset relationship.** `LoopStatus` has twelve members and
   `RunStatus` eight, and each has members the other cannot express — see `STATUS_VOCABULARY_DELTA`.
   "One status vocabulary" therefore costs a decision per orphan, not a rename.
3. **`WorkflowRun.task_list_id` is declared and inert.** It has no writer and no reader outside
   `models.py`; and it is singular, where a loop keeps one TaskList PER PHASE
   (`Loop.task_list_ids: {phase_key: task_list_id}`). So the projection to tasks is one field short
   of the loop's shape before any code moves.
