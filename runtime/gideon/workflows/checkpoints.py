"""Checkpoints, `fork`, and `revert` — branching a run without mutating it.

`rewind` and `run_from` are IN-PLACE: they edit the run you are steering. `fork` is the
branching primitive, for exploratory divergence where the original result must survive
("try a stricter judge, keep the old answer"). The original run and its journal stay
**immutable**; the child gets its own run dir.

**A fork is cheap because the journal cache keys match.** Cache keys are
`(instance_path, epoch, inputs_hash, spec_hash)` — none of which is the run id — so a
child that copies the parent's journal prefix gets cache HITS on everything up to the fork
point and re-runs only what diverges. That is why the prefix is copied rather than
recomputed.

**What a fork does NOT isolate has to be said out loud (WF2-R2 am.).** Isolated: run state,
spec, journal, outputs, effect ledger. *Not* isolated: the filesystem workspace, external
resources the parent created, and anything keyed off wall-clock or randomness. So a fork
records `fork_axis` — a per-fork disambiguator threaded into the child's inputs — and
`isolation_note`s that name the shared axes. A fork that silently shared a git branch or an
output filename with its parent would corrupt both, and the honest move is to name the
limit rather than imply a sandbox that does not exist.

**`revert` is the narrow inverse of `rewind`.** Rewind resets a region forward-blind;
revert undoes ONE node's effect and refuses (409-style, with the conflict named) when later
state already depends on it. Refusing loudly beats silently unwinding a value three
downstream nodes have already consumed.
