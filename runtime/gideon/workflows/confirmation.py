"""ConfirmationRequest: ONE durable typed record for every gate (TASKS-SOPS §4, R6 — S57).

Four flows asked the user for something and none of them said what an approval IS as data: checklist
sign-offs, workflow approval gates, needs-input questions, destructive-action confirmations. Four
bespoke paths meant four inbox surfaces and three-and-a-half autonomy policies.

One entity fixes that, and the entity is only worth having if it is durable — a record that
lived in
memory would lose every pending approval on a restart, which is precisely the moment a user
comes back
to answer one.

The properties that decide the shape:

* **Single-use resolution is a CLAIM, not a check.** `human_input.consume_continuation` owns it, and
  this session fixed it: it used to read-then-`unlink`, and measured, 8 racing resumes had multiple
  callers receive the payload in 36 of 40 trials. `os.rename` decides the winner BEFORE anything is
  read (0 of 40). Double-clicking Resume can now never replay a clarification downstream.
* **Auto-resume must not re-execute completed stages.** The run pauses ON the record;
resolution hands
  the answer to the waiting node. Re-running from the top would spend the whole run's tokens
  again and
  produce different output than the user approved.
* **`payload_preview` is redacted at CONSTRUCTION.** A preview is the field most likely to carry a
  fetched credential into an inbox row, and redacting at render time means every surface has to
  remember.
* **An expired record follows a declared policy, never a default.** Auto-rejecting a destructive
  confirmation is safe; auto-rejecting a needs-input question throws away work. So the policy is
  per-type, and it is written down.

Pure records and decisions. Persistence rides the existing continuation store — one
claim primitive, one directory, one audit trail — rather than a second one.
