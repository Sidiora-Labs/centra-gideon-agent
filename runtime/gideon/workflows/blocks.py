"""Shared prompt blocks — the conventions library templates reference instead of duplicating.

Six templates independently defined the Finding record three times. That is the shape of the
problem: a convention repeated by hand drifts silently, and drift in a Finding record breaks
things far from the text — a gate predicate like "no open Critical" stops being meaningful once
one stage grades on a different ladder, and the Run Ledger stops being minable by the flywheel.

So a template writes `{{block:finding-record}}` and this module substitutes the real text at
DEFINITION time, next to macro expansion and for the same reasons: what is stored, what is
validated and what the engine runs are one tree, and no run-time component needs to know blocks
exist.

**An unknown block is an ERROR, not a passthrough.** A typo'd `{{block:finding-recrod}}` left
verbatim would reach a model as literal braces, and the model would either ignore it or invent
what it thought was meant — a convention silently not applied, which is worse than one loudly
missing. The reference syntax deliberately mirrors the binding syntax so an author reads both the
same way, but blocks resolve at authoring and bindings resolve at run.

Blocks live in `bundled/shared/<name>.md` and ship in the package, so they are versioned with the
templates that cite them rather than living in a user's home where an upgrade would fight an edit.
