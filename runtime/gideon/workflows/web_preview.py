"""Localhost web preview for a run's dev server (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §6.2).

When a code run's workspace is running a dev server, the cockpit should be able to open it —
the "see what my code loop built" case. This module answers one question: **which listening
TCP ports belong to processes working inside this run's workspace?**

Three deliberate properties, each of which is the answer to a way this feature is usually
built wrong:

* **Computed on read, never persisted.** §6.2 says "registered as ``preview_urls`` on the run
  record"; a stored port list is exactly the stale-link defect — a dev server dies, the record
  keeps the port, and the cockpit offers an "Open Preview" that loads nothing (or, worse,
  loads whatever process took the port next). The scan is cheap and the truth is on the host,
  so the record does not cache it. §6.2's "removed on teardown" then costs no code: a torn-down
  workspace has no processes under it, so it reports no ports.
* **A port is only offered if ``localhost`` can actually reach it.** A listener bound to a LAN
  address is a real listener and a dead ``localhost`` link, so only wildcard/loopback binds are
  reported (:data:`_LOOPBACK_ADDRS`).
* **"Nothing found" and "could not look" are different answers.** Every result carries a
  ``reason`` when the list is empty, because rendering an empty preview section on a host with
  no ``lsof`` would tell the user their server is not running when the truth is that nothing
  looked.

Scope guard (§6.2): this is not a tunnel and not a share. It reports ``http://localhost:<port>``
on the same machine, and there is no authentication layer because there is no remote party.
