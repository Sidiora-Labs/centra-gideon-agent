"""The rigor axis: the CHEAP end of planning (UP-R10, S45).

Session 40 built the classifier that routes rigor; session 44 built the machinery the deep end
enters. This module is the other direction — the paths that exist so that spec-driven planning does
not become a new waterfall.

The plan states the risk plainly: *planner over-machinery for a single user*. Every heavyweight
mechanism in Universal Planning (the grill, contracts, risk gates) is entered only by classifier or
risk escalation. What keeps the cheap paths cheap is here:

* **`rigor: fast`** — an explicit "ten-minute inferior spec, start now". It skips interrogation and
  auto-schedules a refinement gate AFTER the first stage output, so refinement happens against a
  built artifact instead of up-front guessing. This is the anti-waterfall mechanism, and the
  scheduled gate is what makes it honest rather than just "skip the questions".
* **Specify** — one-click single-intent rewrite: a rough intent becomes a runnable one-stage spec.
  For exploratory work, starting is cheaper than planning.
* **revise-spec-from-artifact** — run output plus user reaction feed back into the spec, and each
  fixed defect appends to the acceptance criteria. Append-only, because a ratchet that can be
  loosened is not a ratchet.

Pure functions over spec dicts. No LLM call happens here; `specify_prompt` returns the prompt and
the caller owns the model.
