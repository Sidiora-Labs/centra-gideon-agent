"""The run controller — one conductor per run, and the only writer of run state.

Everything about this module follows from one rule: **a run has exactly one writer**
(WF2-R10). The tick loop under `self._lock` is it. Nothing else — not a dispatcher, not
a watchdog, not an HTTP handler — writes a terminal status. Handlers request; the loop
decides and writes.

That rule is what makes the harder features tractable later. Mid-flight mutation (Slice
4) can only be safe if there is a well-defined moment when no node is being scheduled;
here that moment is "between scheduling steps, holding the lock". Crash recovery can only
be correct if terminal writes are serialized, or a resumed run and a still-dying task
race to disagree about the outcome.

The loop is deliberately boring:

    while not terminal:
        drain cancel intent
        compute frontier (pure)
        launch admitted work
        await *something* finishing
        apply results, persist state

`asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)` is what keeps it responsive without polling: a fast
transform does not wait behind a ten-minute stage. `WAITING` nodes hold no lane and are
woken by deadline, so a run parked on an approval for six hours costs nothing.

**Budget pre-charge (WF2-R4 invariant).** A resumed run inherits spend from its ledger
before scheduling anything. Minting a fresh budget on resume would turn a crash loop into
unbounded spend — the exact failure the cap exists to prevent.
