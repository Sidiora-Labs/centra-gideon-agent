"""Per-template eval specs, derived rather than authored (UP-R13.3, S45).

Session 40's routing fixtures assert which template an intent picks. They say nothing about whether
that template, once picked, produces a good plan — and a routing suite that passes while every
template is subtly wrong is exactly the false confidence the old loop classifiers had.

This module closes that gap the same way session 42 closed the parameter gap: by DERIVING the
benchmark from the template artifact instead of maintaining it beside it. One declarative artifact
compiles into both the runnable plan and its eval config, so the eval cannot drift from the template
— the drift is what makes a hand-maintained benchmark worse than none, because a stale expectation
gets "fixed" by loosening the assertion.

What is derivable and what is not is a hard line here:

* **Derivable** — the fixture intents (from the template's own keywords and example outputs), the
  expected parameterization (from the input schema session 42 already derives from the tree), the
  structural acceptance checks (from the node kinds and gates that are literally present).
* **NOT derivable** — whether the OUTPUT is any good. That needs a judge, and this module never
  pretends otherwise: `EvalSpec.graded_checks` names what a judge would have to grade and leaves it
  to LEARNING-FLYWHEEL, which owns the judge harness.

Pure functions. No LLM, no I/O, no clock — an eval spec that needed a model call to build would be
one nobody runs in CI.
