"""Claim leases — the on-disk half of the pure claim logic in ``containers``.

``containers.claim``/``release`` decide WHETHER a claim may be taken; this module makes
the claim SURVIVE the process that took it. The split is the same one the rest of the
slice keeps: the decision is pure and testable without a gateway, the storage lives here.

Two mechanisms, doing two different jobs:

* **The flock (``concurrency.single_flight``) is mutual exclusion.** It guards the
  read-modify-write of one claim file so two co-tenant workers cannot both read "free"
  and both write themselves as holder. It is held only for the duration of that critical
  section and is released — by the OS even on a crash — the instant it ends. It is NOT the
  lease.
* **The FILE is the lease.** Its recorded ``expires_at`` is what a crashed holder leaves
  behind: the work stays claimed for the TTL and then any reader (``board_row``) drops the
  expired claim at render, so the board is truthful across a gateway kill without any
  process having to clean up.
