"""Persistence for the template pipeline's state (UP-R9, WF2UNI-7).

`template_pipeline` is deliberately PURE — it decides, it does not remember. That split is what
makes the mining and anti-nag rules testable without a home directory, and it is also why the
module sat inert: a decision layer with no state writer never runs in production. This module is
that writer, and it is the whole of it.

Two pieces of state, both file-backed under ``workflows/``:

* **`NudgeState` per shape.** The anti-nag rules are only rules if the state outlives the process.
  A cooldown held in memory means every gateway restart re-offers a nudge the user just declined,
  which is precisely the nagging `should_nudge` exists to prevent — and a user who mutes a nagging
  nudge loses the useful ones too. A DECLINE in particular must be permanent for the shape.
* **`Candidate` templates.** Discover-then-freeze only stops plan drift if the frozen candidate is
  still there on the next similar intent. A candidate that lived in memory would mean two runs of
  the same request generate two different graphs, which is the failure mode the freeze exists to
  close.

Both stores are read-mostly and tiny (one JSON object each), so they are read fresh on every access
rather than cached: a cache would have to be invalidated by a writer in another process, and the
saved read is a few microseconds against a decision that is about to make a model call.
