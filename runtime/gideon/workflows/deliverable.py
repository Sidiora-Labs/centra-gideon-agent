"""A run's DOCUMENT deliverable — the run-side answer to ``GET /api/loops/{id}/report``.

PP-16 unit 1. The loop cockpit has had this since loops shipped: ``loop/store.read_deliverable``
resolves the kind's declared document (``REPORT.md`` / ``MONITOR_LOG.md`` / ``DESIGN.md``) and
``read_log`` returns the worker's cumulative ``FINDINGS.md``, both redacted, both served off one
route. Measured on ``origin/main`` before this module, the run side answered NONE of it: of the 26
run routes, none served a document, and ``service.outbox`` — the closest thing — lists *published
artifacts*, which is a different noun (a run's document is a file its worker maintains in place; an
artifact is something it deliberately published).

Everything here is a READ over files the run already has. No store, no new event kind, no state
invented and none retired — the same posture the ledger-rails third took, and the reason this unit
was the one that was agent-closable while the other four wait on rulings.

**THE MAPPING IS DRIVEN, NOT ASSERTED.** The filename does not live in a constant here. It is
computed by walking ``loop_aliases`` FORWARD — every ``(kind, variant)`` pair the alias table
declares — and asking that kind's own strategy, through the same ``deliverable_name(loop)`` call
``loop/store.read_deliverable`` and ``loop/watchdog._deliverable_file`` make. So a kind that renames
its document renames it here too, and a kind added to the alias table appears here with no edit.
The direction stays the one ``loop_aliases`` mandates: a kind resolves to a template, never the
reverse. This module never asks "which kind was this template", it asks "which templates do the
kinds produce", and inverts its own forward answer.

**ABSENT IS NOT ZERO, AND ABSENT GETS NAMED.** Five different facts all render as "no document" if
you are careless, and only one of them is a worker that has not written yet:

* ``TEMPLATE_UNKNOWN`` — this run's template is not one a loop kind resolves to at all (26 of the
  33 bundled templates are not loop kinds). Its document name is UNKNOWN, which is not the same as
  it having none.
* ``KIND_HAS_NO_DOCUMENT`` — the template IS a loop kind's, and that kind declares ``""``:
  ``goal-pursuit-verifiable``, ``code-project`` and ``general-project`` produce a passing check or a
  diff, and the code IS the output. A named, declared absence.
* ``NOT_WRITTEN`` — the name is known, a readable root exists, and no such file is in it.
* ``NO_ROOT`` — the run has no directory to read at all (never launched, or swept).
* ``UNREADABLE`` — the file is there and the read failed. Reported, never silently blanked.

**Money is deliberately not here, and that is issue #2566.** ``ledger.reader.run_totals`` reports
``cost_usd 0.0`` / ``tokens 0`` for a LOOP, because ``LoopJournal.cycle`` writes no money keys at
all (loop money lives in ``usage/turns.jsonl`` via ``loop_spend``), and ``introspection.RunStats``
has the same shape. PP-16 retires the loop noun ONTO the run noun, so loop-backed runs will flow
through every run-side surface — and "what did this document cost" answered as ``$0.00`` on the one
page a user opens to find out is the worst place for that bug to land. Three packages consume that
contract and changing it needs an owner ruling, so this payload carries no money field rather than
carrying one that would read zero. The rail (``tests/test_pp16_run_deliverable.py``) asserts the
absence, so a later session cannot add one without meeting the finding.

# ── the named absences ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: No loop kind resolves to this run's template, so no kind declares its document name. UNKNOWN,
#: not none — the distinction that keeps a bespoke template from being reported as documentless.
TEMPLATE_UNKNOWN = "template_unknown"

#: The template IS a loop kind's, and the kind declares no document: the check or the diff is the
#: output (verifiable goals, code, general). A DECLARED absence, so it reads differently from one
#: we merely failed to resolve.
KIND_HAS_NO_DOCUMENT = "kind_has_no_document"

#: The name is known and a readable root exists — the worker has not written it yet. The common
#: case, and the only one of the five that time alone resolves.
NOT_WRITTEN = "not_written"

#: The run has no directory to read from (never launched, or retention swept it).
NO_ROOT = "no_root"

#: The file exists and could not be read. Surfaced rather than folded into `not_written`, because a
#: permission problem that renders as "not written yet" is a bug a user will wait out forever.
UNREADABLE = "unreadable"

#: Every reason this module can report, so a typo is a test failure rather than an unhandled string
#: on the wire. The FE renders one sentence per member.
ABSENT_REASONS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(
    {TEMPLATE_UNKNOWN, KIND_HAS_NO_DOCUMENT, NOT_WRITTEN, NO_ROOT, UNREADABLE}
)

#: Where a document was found / would be looked for. The run's provisioned workspace comes FIRST,
#: mirroring ``loop/watchdog._deliverable_file``: the loop brief directs a worker to write its
#: deliverable into the BOUND workspace when there is one, and only an unbound loop writes into its
#: own dir. Resolving the run dir first would miss the file for every isolated run.
ROOT_WORKSPACE = "workspace"
ROOT_RUN_DIR = "run_dir"

#: Bytes of document served inline. A deliverable is a markdown document a human reads, and the
#: panel renders it in one response — but a runaway worker can append forever, and an unbounded read
#: into a JSON body is a memory bound the gateway does not otherwise have. Truncation is REPORTED
#: (``truncated`` plus the real ``bytes``), never silent: a document that quietly stops mid-sentence
#: is indistinguishable from a worker that stopped writing.
MAX_DOC_BYTES = 512 * 1024

#: Longest unbroken non-whitespace run served (and redacted) intact. A byte ceiling alone does NOT
#: bound the cost of this read, which is the measurement that put this constant here:
#: ``security.redact_credentials`` is roughly QUADRATIC in unbroken-TOKEN length and effectively
#: flat in document length. Measured on this machine, every input ~512 KB:
#:
#:   one unbroken token ................. 111.0 s
#:   1024-char tokens ...................   0.246 s
#:   512-char tokens ....................   0.149 s
#:   ordinary prose (spaces, newlines) ..   0.038 s
#:
#: So a worker that appended one 512 KB base64 blob to its REPORT.md would stall this route for
#: nearly two minutes — on a GET, which is an availability bug rather than a slow page. A run of 512
#: non-space characters is a blob and never prose (the longest URL a document plausibly carries
#: fits well inside it), so each is replaced by a marker naming its length BEFORE redaction runs.
#: Replaced whole rather than truncated: half of a credential is still half of a credential.
#: Reported as ``clipped_blobs``, never silent.
MAX_TOKEN_CHARS = 512

#: One unbroken run longer than :data:`MAX_TOKEN_CHARS`.
_BLOB_RE = re.compile(r"\S{%d,}" % (MAX_TOKEN_CHARS + 1))
