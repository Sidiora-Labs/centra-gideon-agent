"""Gate policy — who may answer, what auto-approves, and how an event hold behaves.

Slice 5a made a gate durable. This decides whether a human is asked at all, and whose
answer counts.

**Auto-approve is scoped by RISK, never blanket.** A scheduled run that stops for every
approval is not unattended, but one that waves through a `DESTRUCTIVE` action is a
liability. So trigger-origin runs auto-approve SAFE and CAUTION gates and still block
DESTRUCTIVE ones. The risk gradient is `tool_providers.RiskLevel`, reused deliberately —
a second private vocabulary would drift from the one the approval UI already renders.

**A remote-channel gate is default-DENY and owner-bound.** An approval arriving over a
shared channel is an instruction from whoever typed it, and a workflow gate can authorize
real action. Only the run's requester can answer; a non-owner reply is ignored rather than
argued with, and a gate nobody answers denies rather than passing. Default-ALLOW here
would make a shared Slack channel a privilege-escalation path.

**An event gate must not eat its wake-up.** `gate{kind: event}` holds transiently when a
prerequisite is absent: the triggering event is NOT consumed, a bounded retry counter runs,
and exhaustion gives up LOUDLY. A gate that consumed the event and then failed would lose
the only signal that would ever have satisfied it — the run then waits forever for
something that already happened.

**"Always allow" is run-scoped and cleared on rewind.** Remembering a decision across a
rewind would silently auto-approve the very step the user rewound to reconsider.
