"""The two-layer context-compaction ladder for LLM-backed workflow nodes (WV-12).

A long-horizon node's prompt GROWS. `infer` and the judge branch of `gate` each send
one bounded prompt built from the template text plus everything the run has accumulated
by then — the carried handoff/carryover/decisions block (`_with_carried_context`), a
retry hint, and whatever sibling views and prior outputs its bindings resolve to. Cycle
50 of a loop carries 50 cycles of findings. Before this module the engine sent that
prompt as-is and let the provider decide: a node that had done real work died on a
context-length error the engine could have measured and avoided one call earlier.

**Two layers, in order.**

1. **Proactive**, before the call: measure the prompt against the bound model's window
   and compact at ~80% of it. Cheap, and it keeps the failure from happening.
2. **Error-triggered**, after a failed call: if the provider rejected the prompt for
   LENGTH specifically, re-compact aggressively and retry ONCE before the node fails.
   Layer 2 exists because layer 1's measurement is an APPROXIMATION (see
   `CHARS_PER_TOKEN`) — it is the backstop for the cases the estimate gets wrong, not a
   duplicate of it.

**Reuse, not reimplementation.** All the actual compaction is
`gideon.context_compaction.compact` — the same seam the native agent loop uses at
`agents/native/runtime.py`. That module owns the tool-output pruning pre-pass, the
4-region structure, the ``[CONTEXT COMPACTION — REFERENCE ONLY]`` prefix guard, tool-pair
integrity and the anti-thrashing rule. Re-deriving any of that here would be a second
implementation that drifts from the first, and its docstring is explicit that an orphaned
tool-result *breaks the provider* — so getting it wrong is a live failure, not a style
question.

**Why a prompt is segmented into messages.** `compact()` types on the native loop's
message list; a workflow node has ONE prompt string. So the string is split on its
paragraph boundaries into pseudo-messages, compacted, and rejoined. That is a real
structural match, not a workaround: a node prompt is assembled by CONCATENATION (carried
context first, the task instruction last), so protecting the head and the tail and folding
the middle keeps exactly the two things that must survive — the framing the reader needs
before the instruction, and the instruction itself — and digests the accumulated bulk
between them. A prompt with no middle left to fold is returned unchanged, because there is
then nothing that can be dropped safely.
