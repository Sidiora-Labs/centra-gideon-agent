"""The run snapshot projection and its schema (WF2-R11).

The snapshot is the widget's foundation: `foldSnapshot` builds the whole view-model from it
and every subsequent event is a patch on top. A malformed snapshot therefore does not
degrade the widget, it corrupts it — a missing `nodes` renders a run with no steps, and a
`state` the FE's look-up table does not know renders an unstyled row with no icon. Worse,
both look like an engine bug rather than a projection bug, so the cost lands on whoever
debugs the wrong layer.

So the projection is **validated before transmission**. Not with a schema library (the
codebase has none in core, and adding a dependency for one shape is the wrong trade) but
with an explicit field table checked in one pass. What it buys:

* a missing or wrongly-typed field is caught HERE, where the fix is one line, instead of in
  a browser console;
* the field list is one readable declaration a reader can diff against the FE's
  `WorkflowRunDetailData`, rather than being implied by a dict literal three files away;
* an unknown enum value fails loudly in tests while degrading gracefully in production —
  a run that reached a state the FE cannot style should still render, because a user staring
  at an empty page learns nothing.

**Validation never blocks delivery.** :func:`project` returns the projection plus its
issues; the caller ships the projection and logs the issues. A snapshot withheld because one
optional field was the wrong type would be strictly worse than a slightly wrong one — the
widget would show nothing at all.
