"""The ONE boolean-condition dialect the engine evaluates.

Three places in the engine ask "is this true?": a `gate` of kind `expression`, a `loop`
in `until` mode, and a node's `success_when`. Before this module they answered it two
different ways — and one of them was silently wrong.

**The defect this module exists to fix.** The expression gate resolved its `expr` with
`bindings.resolve` (which INTERPOLATES a template into a string) and then asked
`_truthy` about the result. So the shipped `{{inputs.fix}} == true` became the STRING
`"false == true"` when `fix` was false — and a non-empty string is truthy, so the gate
passed. Two shipped templates carried a gate that could never reject. A comparison is
not a string, and the fix is to parse it rather than to interpolate it.

**The grammar, closed and deliberately small** (precedence low → high)::

    ||        top-level disjunction
    &&        conjunction
    !         unary negation
    ( … )     grouping
    ==  !=    comparison against a literal or another reference
    <leaf>    bare truthiness of a resolved reference

A leaf operand is one of: a `{{binding}}`, a bare `dotted.path` (resolved through the
SAME `bindings.resolve_expr` every prompt uses, pipes included), or a literal —
`true`/`false`/`null`/`none` (case-insensitive), a number, or a quoted string.

**Word forms (`and`/`or`/`not`) are deliberately NOT accepted.** Two spellings of one
operator is a dialect nobody can memorise, and the failure is legible: `a and b` parses
as one bare path, `resolve_expr` cannot walk it, and the caller reports the expression
verbatim. Silently accepting both would instead invite each template to pick one.

**Unresolvable references RAISE `BindingError`** rather than evaluating to false. A
condition that cannot read what it tests has not answered the question, and the callers
each turn that into their own typed failure — a gate cannot pass, a loop stops, a node
fails. Treating "I could not tell" as "no" is how a control ships looking present.
