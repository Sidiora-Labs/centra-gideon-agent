"""Resolving the workflow config knobs the modules actually use (TASKS-SOPS §8 — S61k).

The four fields §8 names are wired through all four config points, and that is exactly where this
program has repeatedly shipped a control that is present and inert: `materialize`, `confirmation`
and `pool` each carry their own module constant, so a field could be set, persisted, echoed back by
`to_dict` and displayed in Settings while the runtime went on using 20 / 7 days / 900s.

So every knob is read HERE, once, with the module constant as the fallback — and each getter is what
the call sites use. A caller that reaches for the constant directly is the drift this module exists
to prevent, and `test_workflows_settings.py` asserts the call sites go through these.

Config reads are best-effort: a malformed `config.json` must not stop a run from materializing its
tasks. Each getter degrades to the constant, which is the value that shipped and is known good.
