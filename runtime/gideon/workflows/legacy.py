"""Archive the pre-v2 SOP files so an upgrade doesn't look like data loss.

The old feature stored one `<name>/WORKFLOW.md` directory per SOP under
`~/.gideon/workflows/`. Those files are the user's own writing, and the v2 engine
cannot read them — its definitions are graph specs, not ordered checklists. Deleting
them would be the wrong call, and leaving them in place is worse than it sounds: Slice 0
puts the v2 def store in the same parent directory, so a stray `WORKFLOW.md` tree would
sit alongside real definitions looking like something the engine ignores for no reason.

So they move once, to `workflows/_legacy_sops/`, and the leading underscore keeps them
out of the def store's scan. Nothing reads them again — they are there so the user can.

Idempotent by inspection rather than by a schema version (the house pattern, and there
is no lifecycle migration runner): a directory containing a `WORKFLOW.md` is legacy, and
an already-archived tree has none left to find.
