"""Agent roster — a slug-keyed catalog PROJECTION over the config agents (WORK-R16).

Not a second registry. `AgentDefinition`s live in `config.json agents{}` (the `agent` entity's
source_of_truth is config), so a roster that stored its own copy of an agent would be a second
source of truth that drifts the moment a user renames one. This module derives the catalog on every
call and owns no state.

Two things the projection buys that reading `config.agents` directly does not:

* **Slugs.** Templates and routing policy reference agents by SLUG — a stable, filename-shaped stem
  — never by display name. A display name is presentation; renaming one must not break every
  template that mentioned it.
* **A drift check.** `unresolved_slugs` answers "does every slug something references still resolve
  to a real agent?". Checked by the test suite (our CI gate), because a template pointing at an
  agent the user deleted fails at RUN time otherwise — the most expensive moment to discover it.
