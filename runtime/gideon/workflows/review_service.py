"""Run-scoped glue for the reviewer-comment triage primitive (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §7, EI-9).

:mod:`gideon.review_triage` is deliberately surface-free and engine-free: it parses, anchors,
triages, briefs and calibrates, and it knows nothing about runs, worktrees or git. This module is
the workflow-run binding for it — the half that answers "which diff?" and "which worker?" — so the
primitive stays reusable by the other consumers §7 names (loop judge feedback, inbox drafts) without
inheriting a run id.

Three decisions worth reading before changing anything here:

**The diff is read live, at every request.** Not stamped on the run, not cached with the findings.
A worker keeps working after the review stage settles, so a stored anchor verdict is stale the
moment it is written — and a stale anchor that still says `anchored` is precisely how an accepted
fix lands on the wrong line. Re-reading costs one `git diff`.

**Anchors are re-validated on the POST, not trusted from the GET.** The user accepted a finding
against what the panel showed them; between render and submit the worker may have moved that line.
So the accept is re-checked against the diff as it is NOW, and a finding that went stale in between
is REFUSED rather than dispatched. Without that second check this endpoint would be a TOCTOU hole
in the one property the atom is built around.

**Dispatch is the run's own steering queue.** `service.steer_run` parks the brief on
`run.extra["steering_queue"]`, which `RunController._consume_steering` drains at the next iteration
boundary and injects into the worker's prompt. That IS "follow-up instructions to the originating
session" for a workflow run — no new delivery channel, no second dialect. A run that has already
reached a terminal status has no boundary left to drain at, so the brief is PARKED for the user to
start a follow-up run with, and the receipt says so. Auto-spawning a fresh run off a review
acceptance would be unattended execution the user never asked for.
