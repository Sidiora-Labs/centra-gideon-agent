"""Code-kind run worktrees: preserve, setup, resume, teardown, reintegration (§4.1 — S52).

S49 declared the `workspace` block and returned an ordered plan; this module performs the code-kind
half of it on the machinery that already exists. `loop/worktree.py` is proven —
`.worktrees/<id>` under
the project's own dir, `pclaw/task-*` branches, idempotent `add_worktree`, `merge_worktree` with a
typed result — so nothing here re-implements git.

Measured against a real repo before writing any of it:

* `add_worktree` on an existing id returns the SAME path rather than failing, which is what makes
  resume free.
* An untracked `.env` is genuinely ABSENT from a fresh worktree. That is why `preserve_patterns` is
  the adoption-critical detail and not a nicety: a worktree where every build fails reads
  to a user as
  "isolation is broken".

Four asymmetries, each chosen:

* **Setup failure does not block the run; teardown failure does not block deletion.** Setup is
  convenience — refusing to run because `npm install` failed makes the block a liability. Teardown
  runs BEFORE deletion because its job is to stop services and sync work out while the
  directory still
  exists.
* **Work is committed before the worktree is removed.** An ephemeral workspace whose run
record points
  at a deleted directory has lost the work; a per-run branch survives, so the record references git.
* **Preserve copies IN, never OUT.** A pattern that copied a worktree file back over the user's real
  tree would make an isolated run able to modify the thing it was isolated from.
* **Reintegration is offered, never performed.** `Apply Locally` and `Checkout Branch` are the two
  verbs a user picks between; a run that auto-merged would decide for them, and the decision is the
  whole reason the work was isolated.

Pure planning + explicit performers. Every function that touches the filesystem takes the paths
explicitly, so the ordering rules are testable in a scratch repo.
