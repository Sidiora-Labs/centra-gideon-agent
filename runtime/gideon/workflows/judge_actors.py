"""Actor-based transitions and judge isolation — both invariants ENFORCED.

Two invariants live here. Both exist because the alternative — telling the model not to
approve its own work — is advice, and advice does not survive a worker that is being
scored on completion. WF2LOO-15 measured that only one of them ran; WF2LOO-13 wired the
other, and every function in this module now has a live caller in `engine.dispatch_gate`'s
judge branch:

* **Judge isolation.** `plan_judge_session` / `validate_judge_model` refuse a `cross_model`
  gate whose candidate judge shares the worker's model family. That seam was itself dead
  once and was wired at S146; the comment there records it.
* **The worker-transition rule.** `check_transition` / `resolve_transition` rule on the actor
  behind the judge gate's terminal transition. An independent judge is `Actor.JUDGE` and may
  complete the node; a gate that opted into `self_judge` is the producer grading itself, so it
  is `Actor.WORKER`, and its `done` is REDIRECTED to `review` — realized by the engine as
  park-and-ask, because "I think I'm done" is a request for adjudication rather than the
  adjudication. It is an opt-in nobody in the bundled set declares, which is precisely why
  giving it teeth could not break a live template.
* **Blinded evidence.** `assemble_judge_evidence` / `blind_provenance` build what the judge
  reads: the rubric prose as `spec`, the gate's bound `evidence` as `tool_output`, with
  retry/iteration markers stripped. It matters because the controller appends a retry hint to a
  node's prompt — so "attempt 3 of 5" really can reach a judge, and that is the pressure that
  produces a lenient pass.

`tests/test_workflows_judge_actors_claims.py` holds this text to the call graph in both
directions, so a future session cannot strand the claim on either side.

**The worker actor may never transition a node to `done`.** It can reach `waiting`
(work parked) or `review` (work submitted). The terminal transition belongs to a judge
or gate actor. This is a state-machine rule, so no amount of prompt engineering can
route around it: a worker claiming completion produces a `review` transition, which
is a *request* for adjudication rather than the adjudication.

**A judge never runs on the tier and session that produced the work.** Same-session
judging asks a model to disagree with its own reasoning trace, which it is measurably
poor at. `cross_model` goes one knob further and requires a different model FAMILY —
same-family judges share the blind spots they are supposed to catch, so a same-family
"independent" judge is a calibration failure wearing the costume of a control.
