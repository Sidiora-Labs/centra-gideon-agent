"""The introspection checklist: what is running, costing, risky, blocked (§6.4, R5/R6/R9 — S53).

The hub and cockpit must answer nine questions **from structured state alone**: what is
running now and
why, what changed, what is blocked, what needs approval, what failed, what is costing money, what is
risky, what will happen next if the user says nothing, and — the one that makes unattended
supervision
trustworthy — whether the checks that passed were real checks.

Everything here is a PROJECTION over the existing journal. `journal.ledger()` already
reads the event
stream and `journal.run_totals()` already aggregates one run; this module adds the cross-run and
per-template views, and it deliberately adds no metrics store. The plan's own words: "pass-rate,
failure distribution and latency percentiles are queries over this — not a separate
metrics store."

Two facts about the real event stream shape everything below, both verified in code rather than
assumed:

1. **`GATE_REJECTED` is declared and emitted NOWHERE.** A said-no metric reading it would
report zero
   rejections for every template and flag all of them as fake checks — a warning badge on
   the entire
   library, which is the same as no badge. Pass/reject is derived from `GATE_RESOLVED`'s own
   `approved` field, which the controller does write on both paths.
2. **A gate that has never run is not a gate that never rejects.** The fake-check warning requires a
   MINIMUM sample before it fires, because "0 rejections in 0 runs" and "0 rejections in
   40 runs" are
   different claims and only the second is evidence.

Pure functions over event lists. The caller reads the journal; these decide what the numbers mean.

# ── the two ledger rails (PP-16 seam 4, the ledger-rails third) ──
#
# The loop cockpit has two rails a run detail has no answer for: the FINDINGS rail (what each unit
# of work produced, in emit order) and the VERDICT/ROI rail (what the judge said about it, and what
# it cost). Both are PROJECTIONS over the PP-5 ledger on the loop side —
# `loop/files.py::get_findings` reads `step_completed`, `get_verdicts` reads `judge_verdict` — and
# both were unreachable on the run side. Measured 2026-09-06: of the four kinds PP-16's
# ledger-rails clause names, `step_completed` surfaced only as an introspection timeline row that
# drops the step's own output ref, `judge_verdict` and `watcher_reaped` surfaced nowhere at all,
# and `breaker_trip` has no run-side producer whatsoever (see `RAIL_PRODUCERS`).
#
# Same doctrine as everything above: pure functions over event lists, no new store. What is new is
# that these two rails must stay honest for BOTH nouns, because PP-16's whole point is that
# loop-shaped events will one day flow through this exact projection — see `_carried`.


#: A rail kind the workflow ENGINE writes, so a count of zero is a real observation.

#: actually produces each. `breaker_trip` is the one that does not: the loop watchdog is its only
#: writer in the tree (`loop/journal.py::breaker_trip`) and the run engine has no breaker to trip.
#: Declared rather than inferred, because a projection over an event list cannot see who writes the
