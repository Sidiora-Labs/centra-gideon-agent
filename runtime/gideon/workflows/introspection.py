"""The introspection checklist: what is running, costing, risky, blocked (§6.4, R5/R6/R9 — S53).

The hub and cockpit must answer nine questions **from structured state alone**: what is
running now and
why, what changed, what is blocked, what needs approval, what failed, what is costing money, what is
risky, what will happen next if the user says nothing, and — the one that makes unattended
supervision
trustworthy — whether the checks that passed were real checks.

Everything here is a PROJECTION over the existing journal. `journal.ledger()` already
reads the event
stream and `journal.run_totals()` already aggregates one run; this module adds the cross-run and
per-template views, and it deliberately adds no metrics store. The plan's own words: "pass-rate,
failure distribution and latency percentiles are queries over this — not a separate
metrics store."

Two facts about the real event stream shape everything below, both verified in code rather than
assumed:

1. **`GATE_REJECTED` is declared and emitted NOWHERE.** A said-no metric reading it would
report zero
   rejections for every template and flag all of them as fake checks — a warning badge on
   the entire
   library, which is the same as no badge. Pass/reject is derived from `GATE_RESOLVED`'s own
   `approved` field, which the controller does write on both paths.
2. **A gate that has never run is not a gate that never rejects.** The fake-check warning requires a
   MINIMUM sample before it fires, because "0 rejections in 0 runs" and "0 rejections in
   40 runs" are
   different claims and only the second is evidence.

Pure functions over event lists. The caller reads the journal; these decide what the numbers mean.

#: Runs before an EDGE'S decision distribution counts as evidence — deliberately the SAME bar as

#: dead-case flag that fires on the third run of a new template is the same noise `gate_stats`'s
#: sample gate exists to prevent — the badge that fires before the metric has ever been right is
#: the one that teaches a reader to ignore the surface. Reusing `FAKE_CHECK_MIN_RUNS` rather than
#: minting a second threshold keeps ONE sample bar across the whole surface: a branch and a gate on
#: the same template must not disagree about what "enough runs" means.
EDGE_STATS_MIN_RUNS = FAKE_CHECK_MIN_RUNS

#: A branch's cases live at the instance path `<branch>.cases[<label>]` (see `tick._visit_branch`).
#: This is the only place the selected case survives in the EVENT STREAM: the branch node's own
#: `{"case": label}` output is offloaded behind an `output_ref`, and its declined edges are held in
#: memory and never journaled. But the taken case runs (a non-`step_skipped` event in its subtree)
#: and every untaken case is SKIPPED with its whole subtree (`controller._skip`) — so the routing is
#: recoverable from paths alone, which keeps this a pure projection over the event list like
#: `gate_stats`, with no output-store read and no new ledger kind.
