"""Tasks as a projection of run state: materialization, dedup, caps (TASKS-SOPS §1 — S55). A
materialized Task is a VIEW of a node, not a second copy of the truth. That single sentence
decides everything here: * **The engine owns the status of a managed task**, so a direct user
write is rejected at the write façade rather than merged. Two writers on one status field
produce a board that disagrees with the run it is showing, and the user believes the board. *
**Dedup is by content, not by transaction.** Per-file JSON storage gives no atomic check-and-
create, so a resume or rewind that re-materializes has to recognize its own earlier work. The
fingerprint is that recognition. * **A fan-out gets a cap, not a task per item.** Twenty
parallel leaves is a readable board; two hundred is a board nobody opens, and the collapse-to-
a-counter is what keeps the surface useful rather than complete. The projection table is the
other half. `TaskStatus` gains exactly ONE member (`SKIPPED`) and the WHY of a block lives in
`blocked_kind`, because a status per reason is a state fork every surface then has to re-
implement — and the surface that forgets is the one that shows a stale column. Pure functions
over node/instance state. The registry call is the caller's: `plan_materialization` decides
what should exist, so the rules are testable without a task store on disk.
