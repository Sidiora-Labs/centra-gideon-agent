"""The service surface the gateway exposes to inbound channel transports.

A channel transport (Slack, and future Telegram/Discord) receives inbound
messages from its external system and must drive the platform's shared runtime:
route a message to a chat session, read cron jobs, append channel history,
consolidate conversation memory, surface notifications on the dashboard, etc.

Rather than hand a channel the whole :class:`~gideon.gateway.GatewayOrchestrator`
(and let it reach into private internals — the coupling that kept Slack welded to
core), the orchestrator exposes exactly this contract. The core orchestrator
satisfies it structurally; a transport depends only on this Protocol.

This is the *core → channel* seam. It carries NO channel-specific state (no Slack
client, tokens, tracking-channels, socket connection) — those live on the channel
transport itself.

        reached an agent with no check. Routing through this method is what turns that
