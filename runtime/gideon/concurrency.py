"""Cross-process concurrency primitives — single-flight locks + orphan reaping.

Two small, vendor-neutral primitives used to make long-running background jobs
(history consolidation, autonomous goal loops, memory promotion) robust against
two failure modes that in-process guards alone can't cover:

- **Double-fire across processes.** PClaw runs several processes against one
  ``config_dir()`` — the gateway, the ``gideon consolidate`` CLI, the eval
  runner. An in-memory running-set guards one call site; :func:`single_flight`
  adds an OS-level advisory lock so a given job-key runs in at most one place at
  a time — across processes, and (because flock is per open file description)
  across threads within one process too.
- **Crash-zombie state.** A process that dies mid-job leaves persisted
  ``running`` rows that nothing will ever finish. :func:`boot_sweep` is the ONE
  boot-adoption path — both work-unit nouns (loops and workflow runs) resolve
  their crash survivors through it, from inside their own supervisor's first
  poll rather than from a separate startup hook (`PP-16`, "one adoption/reaping
  path"). Its docstring carries why that placement, and not the hook, is what
  makes a failed sweep retryable and a slow revival non-blocking.

Both are built on ``fcntl.flock``, the established PClaw locking primitive
(see ``schedule.py``, ``session_pid.py``, ``mcp_core.py``). flock is **released
automatically when the holding process dies**, which is exactly the property we
want: a crash can never leave the lock itself stuck (a DB lock row would).

    Yields ``True`` if this caller acquired the lock (it should do the work), or

    *don't double-run*, never *wait in line*). Acquisition is non-blocking. The
    lock is released on context exit and, if the process dies inside the block,
    by the OS — so it cannot zombie.

    **The exclusion is not cross-process only.** ``flock`` is scoped to the *open
    file description*, and this function opens a fresh one on every call, so two
    THREADS in one process contend exactly as two processes do — the loser gets
    ``False``. Measured (PP-12): 16 threads on one key, peak simultaneous holders

    read-modify-write safe against the engine's in-process ``asyncio.create_task``

    A process that dies mid-job leaves rows persisted as in-flight that nothing will ever

    crash survivor, i.e. persisted in-flight with no live driver in THIS process* — and
    ``decide`` applies whatever fate the subsystem's semantics require (re-arm the worker,
    park it for the user, finish it, honestly abort it). ``decide`` returns ``True`` when it
    wrote a fate, and the ids of those rows come back here so the caller's own poll does not
    immediately re-drive what the sweep just settled.

    Per-row failures are isolated and logged: one unreadable row can never cost a whole
    process its boot adoption.

    **Call it from the owning supervisor's FIRST POLL, never from a separate boot hook**

    and neither is available to a boot hook:

    * **A failed sweep is retried.** The caller flips its ``_swept`` flag only after this
      returns, so a sweep that raises is re-attempted on the next poll. A gateway boot hook
      wrapped in ``except: logger.warning`` loses boot adoption for the life of the process —
      and the rows it should have decided sit in-flight forever, which a user reads as "still
      working" while nothing is.
    * **Startup is not blocked on revival.** Reviving a row can mean spawning a worker or
      re-running a planner pass (a model call). Awaited inline in a gateway's startup
      sequence, N stranded rows delay everything after it, including HTTP readiness.
