"""Cross-process concurrency primitives — single-flight locks + orphan reaping.

Two small, vendor-neutral primitives used to make long-running background jobs
(history consolidation, autonomous goal loops, memory promotion) robust against
two failure modes that in-process guards alone can't cover:

- **Double-fire across processes.** Gideon runs several processes against one
  ``config_dir()`` — the gateway, the ``gideon consolidate`` CLI, the eval
  runner. An in-memory running-set guards one call site; :func:`single_flight`
  adds an OS-level advisory lock so a given job-key runs in at most one place at
  a time — across processes, and (because flock is per open file description)
  across threads within one process too.
- **Crash-zombie state.** A process that dies mid-job leaves persisted
  ``running`` rows that nothing will ever finish. :func:`reap_orphans` is the
  startup-sweep seam that lets each subsystem resolve its own stale rows before
  its supervisor's first poll.

Both are built on ``fcntl.flock``, the established Gideon locking primitive
(see ``schedule.py``, ``session_pid.py``, ``mcp_core.py``). flock is **released
automatically when the holding process dies**, which is exactly the property we
want: a crash can never leave the lock itself stuck (a DB lock row would).

    """Single-flight guard for ``job_key`` — at most one holder does the work.

    Yields ``True`` if this caller acquired the lock (it should do the work), or
    ``False`` if the lock is already held (it should skip — single-flight means
    *don't double-run*, never *wait in line*). Acquisition is non-blocking. The
    lock is released on context exit and, if the process dies inside the block,
    by the OS — so it cannot zombie.

    **The exclusion is not cross-process only.** ``flock`` is scoped to the *open
    file description*, and this function opens a fresh one on every call, so two
    THREADS in one process contend exactly as two processes do — the loser gets
    ``False``. Measured (PP-12): 16 threads on one key, peak simultaneous holders
    inside the critical section = 1. That is what makes ``pool.claim_task``'s
    read-modify-write safe against the engine's in-process ``asyncio.create_task``
    fan-out. Worth stating explicitly because the narrower reading has already cost
    a session: a reader who took the guarantee to be cross-process only diagnosed a
    lease race as an unfixable in-process hole, and this docstring was their source.
