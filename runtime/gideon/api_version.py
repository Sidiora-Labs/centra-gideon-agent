"""The ONE origin of the HTTP API version, its supported window, and the negotiation.

**Why this module exists.** ``API_VERSION`` shipped as a write-only number: it was
defined once in :mod:`gideon.manifest` and only ever *emitted* — into
``GET /api/manifest``'s ``apiVersion`` and the two generated reference documents.
Nothing anywhere COMPARED it. A client built against version 1 and a gateway that
had moved on negotiated nothing and failed later, at whichever field quietly
changed shape — a ``KeyError`` deep in a handler, or a blank screen in a stale
cached SPA bundle. This module is the comparison the constant never had: a client
*declares* the version it was built for, the gateway compares it at ONE
chokepoint (:mod:`gideon.dashboard.api_version_gate`), and a mismatch
outside the declared window is refused through the PL-8 error envelope naming
both versions and which side to upgrade.

**The bump rule — stated here, and only here.**

Bump :data:`API_VERSION` when a change would make a client written against the
previous version *wrong* rather than merely *incomplete*. Concretely, bump for:

* a field REMOVED or RENAMED in any ``/api/**`` response body, the
  ``GET /api/manifest`` document, or the WebSocket event envelope;
* a field whose TYPE or units change (``str`` → ``int``, seconds → milliseconds,
  a scalar becoming a list, a naive timestamp becoming tz-aware);
* a field whose MEANING changes while its name and type stay the same (the
  worst kind, because no deserializer notices);
* a required request parameter ADDED, or an existing one becoming required;
* an enum member REMOVED from a response, or an existing member's semantics
  narrowed such that an old client's branch on it now takes the wrong arm;
* a route MOVED or DELETED (a route *added* is not a bump — see below).

Do NOT bump for: a new route, a new optional response field, a new optional
request parameter, a new enum member appended to a response vocabulary, a new
tool or provider appearing in the manifest's generated sections, or any change
to prose (``description``, ``message``). Those are additive: a client written
against the previous version keeps working, it just does not use the new thing.
Wire *error codes* are governed separately and more strictly — they are
append-only forever (:data:`gideon.http_errors.HTTP_ERROR_CODES`), so a
code addition never bumps this number and a code removal is simply not allowed.

When you bump, decide :data:`MIN_SUPPORTED_API_VERSION` in the same change: raise
it only when carrying the older shape is no longer worth the code, and say so in
the CHANGELOG, because raising it is what turns "still works" into a refusal.

**Why an absent declaration means the OLDEST supported version.** Treating a
missing declaration as *current* is precisely the hole this atom exists to close:
every unversioned client — including the ones that predate versioning, which are
exactly the ones most likely to be wrong — would sail through the gate claiming
to be up to date. Pinning absence to :data:`MIN_SUPPORTED_API_VERSION` inverts
that: an unversioned caller is treated as the oldest thing still tolerated, and
the gate echoes that resolution back in the response's :data:`VERSION_HEADER`, so
"you are being treated as version N" is a fact on the wire rather than an
assumption. Any later version-conditional behavior reads the NEGOTIATED number,
which for an undeclared caller is the floor — so it gets the conservative shape,
not the newest one.
