"""Abstract base for embedding providers — the INFERENCE axis (``embed``).

Model MANAGEMENT (list/download/delete of local embedding models) is a SEPARATE axis:
a local backend (sentence-transformers) ALSO subclasses
:class:`~gideon.local_models.provider.LocalModelProvider`; a remote/hosted
embedder (OpenAI text-embedding-3) implements ONLY this inference axis. The two are
independent — a provider opts into management only if it owns local models.

# --- The sync bridge -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Embedding is resolved as a SYNC callable (vector stores take `embed_fn(text) -> vec`)
# but every provider's `embed` is a coroutine, so each call has to cross the boundary.
# Callers sit on BOTH sides: the CLI and the context builder are sync, the dashboard
# handlers are async. So the bridge must work with and without a running loop.
#
# It used to be done per call, inline, at four sites:
#
#     with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:
#         return pool.submit(asyncio.run, _embed(text)).result(timeout=30)
#
# which had two defects. (1) CHURN: one executor, one thread and one fresh event loop
# PER TEXT — a 2,100-chunk library built and tore down 2,100 of each. (2) The timeout did
# not bound the caller: `with ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool` calls `shutdown(wait=True)`
# on `__exit__`, which JOINS the still-running worker, so `.result(timeout=30)` raised on
# schedule and then the `with` block blocked until the work finished anyway. Measured on
# a 3.0s call with a 0.2s budget: 3.00s to return, a 15x overrun of the stated timeout.
#
# One shared daemon thread hosting one persistent event loop fixes both: the happy path
# creates nothing per call, and the timeout is honoured because the loop thread is never
# joined — a timed-out task is cancelled and abandoned, and the caller returns at its
# deadline. A persistent loop is also strictly kinder to providers than a fresh loop per
# call was: loop-bound provider state (an aiohttp session, say) now stays valid instead
# of being stranded on a closed loop.
