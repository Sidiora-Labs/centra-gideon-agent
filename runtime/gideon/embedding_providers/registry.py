"""Embedding resolution.

Embedding is unified onto the same pluggable Model providers as chat/vision: the
active embedding model is chosen in Settings > Models (``active_models.json`` as
``"provider:model"``) and the whole system embeds with it.

- sentence-transformers models embed **in-process** (no URL) via the local
  ``NativeEmbeddingProvider``.
- every other provider (ollama, openai-compatible, vLLM, …) is a configured Model
  provider that runs externally; its embedding is performed through the LLM provider
  registry's ``embed()`` using the user-supplied endpoint/credential.
