"""The L2 surface-overlay producer — user/agent surface overrides as DATA.

AMBIENT-SURFACES §6 names three surface layers (L0 core, L1 app, L2 user/agent) and
`surface_layers.py` + `ui/surfaces/layers.ts` build the ceiling, the boundary and the
refusals for all three. Until this module there was **no L2 producer**: nothing wrote a
user/agent overlay, so the layer was declared and empty. This is the loader that fills
it, and it is deliberately the narrowest thing that can.

Threat posture (owner ruling, 2026-08-26 — this module is built TO it, and every clause
below has a refusal and a test):

1. **An overlay is DATA, never code.** It is a declarative tree of *references* to
   already-registered component names plus their props — the genui DSL body the model
   already writes, whose parser (`ui/genui/parse.ts`) resolves scalars and ids and
   nothing else. There is no eval, no import, no JSX and no expression language. Every
   value this loader accepts is a string, a list or a dict with a CLOSED key set; a shape
   that would need to execute has nowhere to land.
2. **Unknown component names are REFUSED at load, not rendered and not silently
   dropped.** A dropped node is an invisible failure. Note the deliberate difference from
   the chat path: `GenUiWidget` drops ONE bad line so the rest of a model's answer still
   paints, whereas an overlay is a saved artifact a human or agent authored on purpose —
   half of it rendering is worse than a named refusal. So one bad node refuses the WHOLE
   overlay, and the refusal names the offending component. (Enforced on the FE, where the
   registry lives — `ui/surfaces/overlay.ts`.)
3. **Shadowing a core or app-registered component name is refused at load**, through the
   SAME `registerLayerComponent` an app's L1 module goes through — one rule, both
   producers, one code path. An overlay's ``define`` entries are how it can shadow at
   all, so the rule is not vacuous.
4. **Props are host-schema validated** against the target component's declared schema
   (`validateInvocation`), because an unvalidated prop is the injection surface.
5. **Path containment:** overlays load only from ``$GIDEON_HOME/surfaces/``. Every
   candidate goes through :func:`resolve_overlay_path`, which resolves the real path and
   refuses anything that lands outside — a ``..`` traversal, an absolute path, or a
   symlink pointing out of the directory.
6. **The existing layer machinery is reused, not paralleled.** The ceiling, `LayerBoundary`
   and the error boundary are already layer-generic; this producer FEEDS them. Safe mode
   (``#/dashboard?safe=1`` / ``--safe-surfaces``) forces ``maxLayer=0``, so the FE loader
   does not even fetch and `registerLayerComponent` would refuse an L2 name anyway.

Two consequences of "data, never code" worth stating out loud, because they are why this
format has no knobs a reader might look for:

* **A ``define`` composite takes NO args.** Substituting a caller's argument into a saved
  sub-tree is an expression language, which clause 1 refuses. So a composite declares
  ``args: []`` and `validateInvocation` refuses any arg passed to it as ``excess-args``.
* **A composite has no ``group``.** Groups are a frontend enum (`registry.ts` ``GROUPS``);
  duplicating a closed set across the wire buys a drift risk for a knob nobody needs, so
  every composite registers in ``Layout``.

Refusals come back as :class:`gideon.errors.AgentError` envelopes on a **200**, not
as HTTP errors — the same call the tile-action refusal makes and for the same reason: the
FE renders the refusal beside the surface it belongs to, and a 4xx would make "your
overlay names a component that does not exist" indistinguishable from a broken request.
