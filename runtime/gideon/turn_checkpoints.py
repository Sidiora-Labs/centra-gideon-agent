"""Turn-bound two-phase file checkpointing + ``/rewind-to-turn`` (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §6).

The interactive-tier complement to the workflow journal's run-scoped checkpoints. Scope:
**chat/loop sessions and their tool-driven file edits on the host** — where today a wrong
``edit_file`` is simply gone. :mod:`gideon.dashboard.chat_undo` rolls back the
CONVERSATION and says in its own docstring that files written are NOT reverted; this module
is the other half, and the two stay deliberately separate (rewinding the transcript would
destroy the record of what happened).

**Two phases, per turn:**

1. :func:`begin_turn` — the *identity set*: paths + mtime + size of the files under the
   session's cwd scope. A cheap manifest, no copies, so a turn that writes nothing costs
   only a few KB of JSON. Its job is to tell a later rewind which files the turn *created*
   (present now, absent from the identity set) versus *modified*.
2. :func:`capture_pre_edit` — the *pre-edit backup*: the file-writing tool handlers call
   this before the first mutation of a path in the current turn, so the bytes are copied
   while they still exist. Content-addressed (sha256) and deduped at the session level, via
   :func:`~gideon.atomic_write.atomic_write_bytes`. Only touched files cost bytes.

**Restore is two-phase too, and journaled**, because a half-restored working tree is worse
than no restore: :func:`apply_rewind` first *stages* every restored body as a sibling temp
file and writes a plan journal, then *commits* with :func:`os.replace` (atomic per file).
A process death between the per-file renames leaves the journal on disk;
:func:`resume_incomplete_rewind` finishes it on next access. Nothing is written before the
user has seen :func:`preview_rewind` and confirmed.

**Secrecy floor (:data:`NEVER_CAPTURE_GLOBS`).** ``.env`` and its siblings are never copied
into the store — not filtered on the way out, never written in the first place. This is the
restrictive reading of a plan that says only "``.env`` files were never captured": the store
lives under the home, is covered by snapshots and exports, and a captured credential would
outlive the file the user deleted. The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a skipped
path is recorded in the turn manifest as ``skipped="secret"`` (the *path*, never the bytes)
so :func:`preview_rewind` can warn "not captured" instead of silently restoring nothing.
``is_sensitive_path`` is *also* consulted, but it is home-anchored, so it does not see a
workspace ``.env`` — this floor is what closes that.

**Bounds.** Per-session byte cap and turn cap (``checkpoints.max_mb`` /
``checkpoints.max_turns``), enforced on the way in: adding a body that would exceed the cap
prunes the oldest turns until it fits, and a single body over ``checkpoints.max_file_mb`` is
recorded manifest-only (``skipped="too_large"``) so the preview can say "not captured".
Pruned with the session (:func:`prune_session`).

Explicitly NOT git: it works in non-repos and never touches the user's index.
