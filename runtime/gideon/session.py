"""Session manager — maps channel thread_ts to LLM provider sessions.

Each channel thread gets its own ModelProvider instance. Sessions are
cleaned up after idle timeout (default 30 min).

Warm session pool: ``start_pool()`` pre-spawns ACP agent processes so
``get_or_create()`` returns instantly.  After handing out a warm session,
a replacement is created in the background to maintain the target count.

Background session: ``BACKGROUND_KEY`` is a persistent shared session for
lightweight background work (cron, heartbeat, lesson extraction).  It
stays alive between uses, serialized by the per-session semaphore.

At >= 90% context usage, fires a background task that sends /compact
to the ACP agent (which natively summarizes older turns), then resets the
session. The user's response is never blocked — compaction is fully
fire-and-forget.

Circuit breaker: after 5 consecutive failures on a session, the session
is force-reset instead of retrying forever.

Per-session semaphore: serializes prompts on the same session key so
concurrent channel messages on the same thread don't interleave.

Process Sweep Architecture
--------------------------
Four mechanisms clean up processes. They are complementary — not redundant.

1. ``cleanup_orphaned_sessions()`` — **startup + shutdown only**.
   Reads ``session_pids.txt`` (bare sandbox root PIDs from the previous
   gateway run). Validates each with ``_is_managed_agent_process``, kills descendants
   bottom-up, then kills the root. Truncates the file afterward.
   *Cannot be replaced by the periodic sweep* because sandbox roots are
   independent processes with no idle timeout — they survive indefinitely
   unless explicitly killed.

2. ``_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Reads ``agent_pids.txt`` (child:parent pairs). Kills children whose parent
   is confirmed dead. PPid-based reuse guard prevents killing recycled PIDs.
   Also prunes dead bare PIDs. *Depends on (1)* — children are only orphaned
   after their sandbox root is killed.

3. ``_expire_idle()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Kills sessions idle for >``timeout_secs`` (default 30 min) via
   ``reset()`` → ``provider.shutdown()`` → SIGKILL process tree.
   Protected keys: ``_PERSISTENT_KEYS`` (``_bg`` only).
   **Known limitation**: ``last_used`` is only bumped on ``get_or_create()``,
   not on every LLM round-trip. A task runner step doing continuous work for
   >30 min without a new ``get_or_create()`` call could be swept. This is
   accepted for now to prevent runaway tasks, but may need a heartbeat or
   persistent-key mechanism if longer steps become common.

    it means the resolved workspace root is either not a usable directory or is a

    * Passing the empty string on is what this fixes. ``AcpProcess`` does

      whatever a service manager set — and every file it wrote landed somewhere the user
      cannot find. Same family as G39's real-home escape: a containment decision falling
      through to an ambient value.
    * Substituting ``workspace_root()`` (G39's standardised definition) would be worse in
      the case that actually reaches here, because that is the very path the sensitivity
      check rejected. It would spawn the CLI inside a credential directory.

    So this refuses, loudly, at the last point that can still stop the spawn. A wrong cwd
