"""Reading a snapshot archive's own manifest — the archive browser's row data (§6, DAS-10).

§6 asks the archive browser to show "per-domain row counts (from the manifest)". The
counts are written INTO the archive by `snapshot.py` (MANIFEST v3's ``domains`` block),
so this module's whole job is getting them back out cheaply.

**Why a sidecar.** Reading a member out of a `.tar.gz` means streaming-decompressing
until that member appears — worst case the whole archive. A settings page listing twenty
snapshots would decompress twenty multi-hundred-megabyte tarballs to render a table, so
the counts are also written beside the tar as ``<name>.manifest.json`` at snapshot time
and read from there. An archive taken before v3 has no sidecar: it is backfilled ONCE by
extracting its manifest, and reports ``None`` if it has no manifest at all. That is an
idempotent backfill, not a migration — nothing is rewritten, a missing sidecar simply
gets created the first time someone looks.

``None`` and ``{}`` are deliberately different answers: ``None`` means "this archive
recorded no counts", ``{}`` means "it recorded counts and there were none". Collapsing
them would make an empty backup indistinguishable from an unlabelled one.
