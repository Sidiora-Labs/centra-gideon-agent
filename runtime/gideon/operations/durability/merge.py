"""Deterministic row-level merge for the sync cycle (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4, DAS-6c-i).

The pure core the sync cycle (DAS-6c-ii) orchestrates: given local rows and the
rows imported from a remote's shards (:func:`shards.import_shards`), reconcile them
by the entry's declared ``merge`` strategy — never losing a row, never silently
picking a loser. No CRDTs: per-id union + last-write-wins + tombstones (§Anti-goals).

Every function here is PURE (no I/O, no clock) and DETERMINISTIC — same inputs →
byte-identical output — so a merge is reviewable and a re-merge of unchanged state
is a no-op (the property the cycle's free-retry-on-CAS-race depends on). The cycle
layer owns the transport, the CAS registry, and writing the merged rows back.

Strategies (mirror ``inventory.MERGE_*``):
- ``union_by_id``       — keep every row present on either side, keyed by ``id``;
                          a tombstone (``deleted_at``) on either side wins over a
                          live row with the same id (deletion survives the union).
- ``lww_by_updated_at`` — same union, but a same-id row present on both sides
                          resolves to the one with the greater ``updated_at``
                          (ties → the local row, so a merge is stable).
- ``append_dedup``      — concatenate two append-only streams, dedup by a stable
                          per-row id (a re-import is a no-op); order preserved.
- ``sqlite_attach_ignore`` / ``replace_only`` — NOT row-merged here (the cycle
                          handles DBs via the attach-ignore path and skips
                          replace_only entries); calling this module for them is a
                          programming error, raised loudly.
