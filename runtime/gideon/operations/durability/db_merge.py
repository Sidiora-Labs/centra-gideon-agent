"""The sqlite DB-merge seam for the sync cycle (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-h).

The pull engine reconciles row entries itself but DECLINES `sqlite`/`tree` entries, calling an
injected ``db_merger(entry, shard_dir) -> verdict`` for them (DAS-6c-ii-e). This module is that
callback. It finds the whole-DB copy the exporter staged under ``db/<entry_id>.db`` (DAS-6c-ii-g)
and ATTACH-merges it into the live database, reusing the proven snapshot merge machinery rather
than inventing a second one:

* ``memory.db`` → ``snapshot._merge_memory`` — a four-table allowlist that filters
  ``WHERE is_deleted=0`` so a synced-in copy never RESURRECTS a memory the user deleted (the
  reason memory.db keeps its own executor instead of the generic all-tables path).
* every other ``KIND_SQLITE`` entry → ``snapshot._merge_sqlite_attach`` — every real table
  merged with ``INSERT OR IGNORE``, FTS shadow tables skipped and the index rebuilt.

Embeddings ride the ATTACH (they live IN the DB, carried by the merge — matching the snapshot
precedent, so a synced memory is searchable without re-embedding). Derived indexes
(``memory.faiss`` / ``memory_index.db``, `derived=True`) are NOT synced and are rebuilt locally
by their owning subsystems (boot rebuild + the heartbeat reindex) — this merger touches only the
authoritative DB, per §4.1 "indexes rebuilt on import, never synced".

Verdicts returned to the cursor: ``consumed`` on a clean merge; ``prerequisite-absent`` if this
seq carried no DB copy for the entry (a row-only export mis-routed here — hold, don't advance
past unmerged data); ``payload-bad`` if the merge itself fails (advance past a poison DB so it
can't wedge every later seq).
