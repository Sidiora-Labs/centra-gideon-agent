#: How many versions of one record this home keeps as published, newest last. A peer hands back
#: a copy at most a few cycles old — it pulls this home's newest copy before it exports — so this
#: covers every one it can, and a copy older than all of them reads as a conflict, never as an
#: edit taken over a newer one.
PUBLISHED_VERSIONS = 16

#: How long this home remembers a record as deleted, and how long its own delete rides its sync
#: copies: a machine away for longer than this never sees the delete, and its copy of the record
#: can come back. A peer reads only a machine's newest copy (``pull_engine``), and the copies before
#: it are removed (``durability.published``), so the delete has to be in the newest when that peer
#: comes back. A delete is an id, a time and a few hashes, so a long horizon costs nearly nothing.
