"""Sync-only tombstone side-log for hard-delete entity stores (DAS-6c-iii-a, owner Fork B).

Some entity-dir stores (``tasks``, ``projects``) delete by removing the file — a hard
``unlink``, chosen so the store's own UX carries no soft-delete/undo/retention surface. But
sync's union merge needs a DELETE MARKER to survive, or a peer that still holds the row live
would resurrect it. Reconciling those two: the delete stays a hard unlink, and the store ALSO
appends ``{"id": <row_id>, "deleted_at": <iso>}`` to a **sync-only** side-log
``<entry_path>/_tombstones.jsonl`` that the durability layer folds into the export as tombstone
rows. The store never reads this file back — it is invisible to the store's own read paths (a
``.jsonl`` under an entity dir the store globs as ``*.json``); it exists purely so a delete
propagates across machines.

This module owns the log's read/write + the export fold. The delete write-sites call
:func:`record_tombstone` (wired in DAS-6c-iii-b). A GC (:func:`prune`) trims entries past the
sync horizon so the log can't grow without bound — a tombstone only needs to outlive the window
in which a peer could still be carrying the deleted row live.

Clock-free at the seam: ``now`` / ``keep_after`` are passed in, so a replay is deterministic.
