"""How a restore and an import bring each part of an archive into the home, and say what became
of it.

A merge restore and a replace restore (``snapshot``) and the import of an export archive
(``portability``) put an archive's parts into the home one at a time: a file merged into the one the
home has, or brought in where it has none (:func:`merged_or_brought_in`), and a folder copied into
what the home's lacks (:func:`copy_tree_no_overwrite`). Each takes its path from
``durability.home_paths``, which leaves a part the home holds behind a link as it is and names it,
and each restore says what became of every part (:func:`said`, :func:`left_unchanged_line`), so a
part it left unchanged is never reported as done.
