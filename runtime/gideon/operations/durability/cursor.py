"""The consumed-only pull cursor (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.1, DAS-6c-ii-b).

When the cycle pulls a peer's shards it merges them, and only then may it record "I have
now seen this peer up to seq N". The cursor is that durable per-peer high-water mark — the
``seen`` map :meth:`registry.Registry.new_prefixes_since` reads to decide what is still
unpulled. Its one hard rule, verbatim from §4.1:

    the pull cursor advances **only on consumed rows** — prerequisite-absent holds the
    drain, payload-bad advances+logs.

So the cursor is *not* advanced merely because a pull was attempted. Three consume verdicts:

* **consumed** — the shard set merged cleanly → advance the peer's high-water mark to that
  seq. Because prefixes are pulled oldest-first (the registry yields them ascending), the
  mark only ever moves forward by contiguous seqs; a gap is never skipped.
* **prerequisite-absent** — the shard references state this machine doesn't have yet (an
  out-of-order arrival) → **hold**: do not advance, so the same seq is retried next cycle
  once its prerequisite lands. This is the one verdict that must not advance, or the drain
  would strand work it silently skipped past.
* **payload-bad** — the shard is structurally broken and will never merge → advance anyway
  and log, so one poison object can't wedge the cursor and block every later seq behind it.

Advancement is monotonic (a stale verdict can never lower a mark) and clock-free bookkeeping
persisted as one small JSON file; the merge itself lives in :mod:`durability.merge`.
