"""Tiered snapshot retention (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §3).

`--keep N` keeps the N most recent snapshots, which on a nightly schedule means a
week of history and nothing older. That is the wrong shape for the failure it
protects against: corruption you notice immediately needs yesterday, and corruption
you notice in April needs January.

So retention is generalized to tiers — N daily, M weekly, Y monthly. One snapshot is
promoted per period (the newest in that ISO week / calendar month), and everything
else ages out. Roughly 20 files cover a year instead of 365.

Pure functions over timestamps, deliberately: retention decisions are the kind of
thing you want to unit-test exhaustively without creating a single tar file.
