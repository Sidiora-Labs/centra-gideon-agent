"""What this machine last published to its sync store, and which of its copies the store keeps.

Every sync cycle exports this machine's records whole (``shards.export_shards(for_sync=True)``),
and a publish writes that export as a new seq: one complete copy, about as large as the records.
Two rules keep the store from holding a copy per cycle forever.

**A copy is sent only when the records changed.** :func:`export_digest` is one sha over what an
export holds, read from the export itself: a store a sync merges record by record counts by what
two homes compare of each record (``conflicts.compared``), and every other store by its shards'
and database copies' sha256 in the manifest. Two exports of an unchanged home give the same
digest. What changes in this home by itself while nothing happens does not count: the manifest's
own time, an automation's run times (its heartbeat runs every minute), and the security log — this
machine's account of what happened on it, which those runs append to every minute. They ride the
next copy that is sent; counted, every export was new, and every sync sent a whole copy.
:class:`Published` keeps the digest of the copy last sent, here on this machine and never in the
shared registry — that is the one object an encrypted sync leaves readable, and a hash of what a
copy holds is not the store's to read.

**A copy a newer one replaced is removed** (:func:`superseded`). A peer reads one copy of each
machine — the newest the registry names when its cycle starts — so a copy stops being read once a
newer one lands, and a peer that started reading it just before has :data:`KEEP_PREVIOUS_SECS`
to finish. So the store keeps this machine's newest copy, and the one before it until the newest
has been there that long; every older one is removed. A read cut short anyway is never merged: an
export that lacks files is held whole (``shards.IncompleteExport``) and the next cycle reads the
newest. The newest is never removed, so a machine that has been away catches up from it.

Machine-local, under the sync root beside the pull cursor, which the home audit ignores, so it is
never exported. Clock-free: ``now`` is passed in, an ISO-8601 time, and a time that doesn't parse
removes nothing.
