"""Conflict records + the review queue (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.2, DAS-7).

§4.2's rule, verbatim: sha-divergence on the same entity id with **both sides edited
since the common ancestor** is a *conflict*, not an LWW coin-flip. This module owns the
detection rule and the durable queue the conflict lands in; the propose-only LLM draft
lives in :mod:`durability.conflict_merge`, and the live store is written by nobody here.

Three properties this module exists to guarantee:

* **Both-sides-edited is the trigger.** A divergence where only ONE side moved since the
  common ancestor is a fast-forward the deterministic merge already resolves correctly —
  recording it would make every ordinary sync produce review noise. So a conflict needs
  three shas to disagree: ``ancestor != local != remote != ancestor``. No ancestor on
  record (a family this machine has never agreed on) is likewise NOT a conflict: with no
  common point there is nothing to say both sides moved *from*, and §4.2 item 1 hands
  those to the deterministic merge.
* **The local version stays authoritative.** A recorded conflict HOLDS its id: the caller
  (:func:`reconcile.reconcile_entry`) drops the remote row for that id before merging, so
  the local bytes are untouched until a human resolves. Nothing is lost — the remote
  version is inside the record, and the peer's shard is insert-only in the shared store.
* **A conflict is never a merge input.** Record ids are deterministic
  (``entry|id|ancestor|local|remote``), so re-detecting the same divergence next cycle
  dedups into the same row instead of piling up, and a resolved-then-recurring divergence
  is legible rather than duplicated.

Storage is one append-only JSONL under the sync root (``sync/conflicts.jsonl``) —
machine-local, alongside the pull cursor and the outbox, because a conflict is *this*
machine's unresolved decision and both versions durably persist in the shared store
regardless (§4.2). It is deliberately NOT an inventory entry: an inventory entry under
``sync/`` would be exported into the very shards a pull rewrites mid-cycle, i.e. a
self-referential synced store. ``sync/`` is IGNORED by the home audit for that reason.

Routing (§4.2 item 3): the record carries the surface its entry's ``domain`` maps to —
memory-domain conflicts to the memory review surface, knowledge-domain to the knowledge
UI, everything else to the Durability queue. The boundary holds in the failure path too:
a conflict with no drafted proposal still carries its surface.
