"""Apply a reviewed conflict's chosen version to the live store (§4.2 item 2, DAS-10).

:mod:`durability.conflicts` detects a both-sides-edited divergence and HOLDS the local row;
:mod:`durability.conflict_merge` may draft a proposed merge. Neither writes anything — the
soul rule is propose, don't write. This module is the ONE place a human decision becomes a
write, which is why the choice is explicit (three named versions, no "auto") and why the
caller must confirm it.

**Failure semantics: recoverable, not transactional** — the same choice the §6 export/import
half made and stated. There is no cross-store transaction to be had here, so the ordering is
picked so that every failure leaves a state a repeat of the same request fixes:

1. The store write goes first, as a WHOLE-ENTRY rewrite through
   :func:`durability.writeback.apply_rows` — the same path the sync cycle itself uses. Every
   local row is read, the one reviewed row is substituted by entity id, and the full set is
   written back atomically (temp file + rename). A single-row ``apply_rows`` would truncate a
   ``jsonl_append`` stream to one event, so the substitution is not an optimisation to skip.
2. The queue record flips to ``resolved`` only AFTER that write returns.

So a failed write leaves the record ``needs-review`` and the store untouched (the caller sees
a typed error, never a success); a write that lands but whose queue update fails leaves the
record ``needs-review`` too, and re-resolving writes the identical bytes — idempotent, so the
recoverable direction is "ask again", never "half-applied and reported done".

**What the next sync cycle does with a resolution.** Nothing is pushed from here; the cycle
converges on its own schedule, and it does so differently per choice:

* ``keep_local`` — the three shas are unchanged, so :func:`conflicts.detect_conflicts` (a pure
  function that never consults the queue) detects the same divergence next cycle and HOLDS the
  id again, so the local row keeps winning. ``queue.record`` dedups on the record id, so the
  resolved record is not resurrected as a new needs-review row. The decision sticks.
* ``take_remote`` — local becomes the remote sha, so the two sides are converged and the
  divergence stops being detected at all.
* ``accept_proposal`` — local becomes a THIRD sha the peer has never seen, so once the peer's
  export is pulled the divergence is genuinely new (different local sha → different record id)
  and a fresh review item appears until the peer has the merged row. That is honest rather
  than convenient: a proposal the peer hasn't seen is not agreement, and pretending otherwise
  is how a merge silently loses the other machine's edit.
