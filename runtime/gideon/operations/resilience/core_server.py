"""Gideon's own server in the agent runtime config: the Doctor's one reading of it.

``agents/gideon.json`` names the servers the agent launches (``mcpServers``), the tools it is
offered (``tools``) and the tools it runs without asking (``allowedTools``). On a config that
exists, every gateway start writes Gideon's own server into ``mcpServers``
(``agent.rebuild_agent_config``) and keeps the server where the owner left it in the two lists.

The Doctor's check (``tools.core_server`` in :mod:`~gideon.operations.resilience.doctor`),
``gideon doctor`` and the check's Fix (:mod:`~gideon.resilience.fixes`) all read the
file here, so they judge one file one way and say a fault in the same words. Nothing here writes:
the Fix is the one writer, and it changes only the server entry. Where the server stands in the
two lists is read and never changed, by the Doctor or by any of its Fixes: they are the owner's.
