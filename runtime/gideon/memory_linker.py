"""Write-time linking + alias seeding (MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §1.1, §1.3).

`memory_graph` owns the tables; this module owns the *decisions*: which entities a
record mentions, which edge type each mention deserves, and where the entity set
comes from in the first place.

Two rules to keep in mind when extending the cascade:

* **First match wins, most specific first.** A record can carry several structural
  cues; the cascade is an ordered ladder, not a scoring function, because a
  deterministic linker whose output depends on tie-breaks is not deterministic in
  any useful sense.
* **The linker never raises into a write.** Memory writes are the user's data
  arriving; a linking bug must degrade to "no links", never to "your fact was
  rejected". Every entry point here swallows and logs.
