"""Supply-chain safety — the shared install-time content scanner.

A single, vendor-neutral ``SkillScanner`` that statically inspects **staged**
(not-yet-live) community content — skills AND apps both carry executable code
(``scripts/``, ``setup`` hooks) and become reachable the moment they install, so
both run through this one gate before anything lands live.

The scanner is **pattern + structural, no LLM on the hot path** (an install must
work offline / deterministically). It returns a :class:`ScanReport` with a
:class:`Verdict`; the *decision* (commit / confirm / refuse) is the caller's,
modulated by the source's trust tier. ``dangerous`` is the load-bearing floor:
reserved for high-confidence malice (exfil-to-remote, destructive-root,
obfuscated-exec) so a calculated ``warning`` stays overridable but outright
malware never is.

Reuses ``history._SENSITIVE_TOOL_PATTERNS`` (the credential/secret path set) so
"reads ~/.aws" detection has one source of truth. Not a sandbox — static
inspection only; it reduces risk, it does not contain execution.

The DANGEROUS band is additionally scoped by EXECUTION REACHABILITY (issues #2526,
#2625) — the "Execution reachability" section below states the rule in full. In short: a
match the bundle cannot execute is *disclosed* as a ``warning`` rather than refused
outright, because it is a string (or a comment), not a payload. Default-deny throughout —
a match stays DANGEROUS unless inertness is PROVED, and proved structurally from the AST
and the tokeniser rather than from the text, so the failure mode is a false block and
never a false pass.

# followed the `/`, while the same call with one trailing space was terminal (#2607). So the
# set also closes on a quote (all three kinds — Python/shell, and a JS template literal), on
# `)` for `$(rm -rf /)` and `execSync(...)`, and on `\` for an escape like `"rm -rf /\n"`.

# ── Execution reachability — scoping the DANGEROUS band (issue #2526) ───────
#
# THE DEFECT. The DANGEROUS rules above match a string SHAPE and are blind to whether
# anything executes that string. So a bundle whose test fixture holds a real attack
# string — the string that proves its input validation refuses the attack — was judged
# identically to a bundle that runs it. DANGEROUS is terminal and non-consentable, so
# the fixture permanently blocked the install: `spec-builder` and `ops`, the two most
# security-conscious bundles in the suite, could not be installed AT ALL, while a
# bundle that never tested its validation shipped clean. The rule as written taught
# authors to delete their adversarial tests or obfuscate the strings until the scanner
# stopped recognising them — both of which make the ecosystem less safe.
#
# WHY REACHABILITY AND NOT THE TWO EASIER FIXES. #2526 offered three directions.
#
#   * "Skip test files" was rejected there on the grounds that a `test_*.py` ships
#     inside the bundle and is importable, so exempting it "would create a place to
#     park a payload". THAT OBJECTION DOES NOT APPLY HERE, and the distinction is the
#     whole basis of this code: parking a payload requires something that can execute
#     it. A string nothing can execute is not a payload — it is a string. The predicate
#     below is therefore stated on the AST and NEVER on a filename, so naming a file
#     `test_evil.py` buys an attacker exactly nothing (asserted, in the reachability
#     suite's attack table).
#   * "Downgrade a match on a test surface to WARNING" was rejected because it leans on
#     the install-consent dialog, and #2513 documents that surface as currently
#     defective (an explicit `"network": false` printed as "not declared", cron cadence
#     rendered as raw crontab, the rule never glossed). Turning a terminal block into a
#     consentable warning the user may not reliably read trades a false-positive block
#     for a real-payload pass. Reachability scoping ELIMINATES the false positive
#     instead of downgrading it: the two blocked bundles stop matching the terminal
#     band because their fixtures genuinely cannot run.
#   * "Make authors build adversarial strings at runtime" was rejected because the
#     workaround is exactly the obfuscation an attacker already uses (`"rm -" + "rf /"`
#     scores CLEAN today), so it filters honest authors and nobody else — and it
#     degrades the fixtures, whose entire job is to be read.
#
# THE RULE. A DANGEROUS match is re-scored to WARNING — never lower, never dropped —
# iff L0 holds, or ALL FIVE of L1-L5 do. Default-deny: fail a clause, or fail to
# evaluate one, and the finding stays DANGEROUS. The failure mode is a false BLOCK
# (annoying, and fixable by the author) and never a false PASS.
#
#   L0  COMMENTARY, NOT CODE (issue #2625). Every match of this rule lies wholly inside a
#       ``COMMENT`` token or a docstring. That is decided from :mod:`tokenize` and the
#       AST, never from the text — see the note below on why that distinction is the
#       whole basis of this clause. L0 short-circuits: it does not consult L2-L5, because
#       those clauses all ask whether a STRING THE FILE HOLDS can be handed to an
#       interpreter, and a comment is not a string the file holds. The tokeniser throws
#       it away before the compiler ever sees it, so no sink, no import edge and no
#       top-level call in the bundle can reach it.
#   L1  LITERAL, NOT CODE. The file parses as Python and every match of this rule that
#       the scanner could have reported lies wholly inside a ``str`` constant (or, per
#       L0, inside commentary — so documenting an inert fixture next to it does not
#       revoke the fixture's own downgrade). A `.sh` file is never eligible: its text IS
#       its program. Decided on AST spans, not on text.
#   L2  NO EXECUTION SINK IN THE FILE. The file contains no sink that could receive a
#       string: no ``os.system``/``popen``/``exec*``/``spawn*``/``fork``, no
#       ``eval``/``exec``/``compile``/``__import__``, no ``subprocess`` call whose
#       ``shell`` is anything but a literal ``False``, and every spawn site's argv[0] is
#       a literal program name that is not a shell, not an interpreter and not a path.
#       This is the clause that does the work, and it is deliberately stated at MODULE
#       scope rather than on the literal's argument position. "Is this literal passed to
#       a sink?" is defeated by two lines (`c = "rm -rf / " + x; os.system(c)`), so the
#       question asked is the answerable one: can this file hand ANY string to an
#       interpreter? If it can, the literal is treated as reachable.
#   L3  NO EXPORT. Nothing else in the bundle can lift the literal out: no other module
#       imports it, no sibling names its file or module stem in a string, no script or
#       config in the bundle mentions it, and ``app.json`` does not declare it. Prose is
#       deliberately excluded — a README saying "run pytest test_provider.py" is
#       documentation, and counting it would make L3 unsatisfiable for every bundle that
#       documents its own test command.
#   L4  THE GRAPH IS TRUSTWORTHY. L3 is a static claim, so it is void if the bundle can
#       rewrite its own import graph at runtime. Any ``eval``/``exec``/``compile``/
#       ``__import__``/``importlib``/``runpy``/``pickle``/``marshal``/``ctypes``, any
#       ``getattr`` with a computed name, any ``import *``, any ``sys.path`` mutation —
#       or any Python/loader file the walk could not read — ANYWHERE in the bundle
#       revokes the downgrade for the whole bundle.
#   L5  IMPORTING IT IS A NO-OP. Unreachable is not never-imported: a test runner, or a
#       curious user, may import the module. Its top level must contain no call outside
#       a small pure allowlist, so the payload cannot fire on import.
#
# WHY L0 IS ON THE TOKENISER AND NOT ON THE TEXT (issue #2625). "Skip lines that start
# with ``#``" is a one-liner and it is the wrong fix: it is defeated by anything that
# merely LOOKS like a comment, which is exactly the payload parking spot #2526 refused to
# create. ``X = "#"`` opens a string, and every ``#`` to the end of that string is inside
# a ``str`` token, not a comment — a text scan reading the next line as commentary would
# hand an attacker a way to hide live code behind a fake one. A tokeniser cannot be fooled
# that way: it reports the token class the compiler will actually see, so a line that
# tokenises as code is code no matter what it looks like. The scanner already had one
# available. (:func:`_strip_line_comments` and :func:`_on_comment_only_line` remain text
# heuristics, deliberately: they only ever NARROW what the ``exfil_sensitive_path`` rule
# may match, so being fooled there costs recall on a rule, never the floor.)
#
# RESIDUAL, STATED NOT HIDDEN. Two shapes, both narrower than the rule they replace.
#
#   * A bundle can ship a module of pure inert data that nothing references and get its
#     literal disclosed-and-consentable instead of refused. That is a real reduction in
#     the floor for that one shape. The counterweight is measured, not asserted: the
#     shipped band already scores ``"rm -" + "rf /"`` as CLEAN and ``os.system("rm -rf
#     /")`` as WARNING, so the capability given up is refusing the attacker who wrote
#     their payload as a plain literal AND left it unreachable AND did not obfuscate it.
#   * Under L0, a bundle that performs STRING SURGERY ON ITS OWN SOURCE — reads a sibling
#     file, strips the ``#``, and ``exec``s the result — could promote a comment back to
#     code, and L0 does not consult L4's bundle-wide graph-trust check to stop it. L4
#     exists to protect L3's static "nothing imports it" claim, and L0 makes no such
#     claim, so extending it here would refuse the honest author for a threat that does
#     not need a comment: a bundle that can ``exec`` arbitrary text can spell the payload
#     itself, and its ``exec`` is separately flagged. It is a real hole all the same, and
#     it is the reason L0 is stated on a token class rather than on a filename or a line.
#
# Either way the finding survives: rule id, path, evidence and a required click, all
# unchanged. See ``tests/security/test_scanner_reachability.py``.

# ── Native destruction — the DANGEROUS band spelled in the host language (#2607) ──
#
# THE DEFECT. Every rule in `_DANGEROUS_SCRIPT` is a SHELL string: `rm -rf /`, the fork bomb,
# `mkfs`/`dd`, `curl|sh`, `base64 -d|sh`. The terminal tier assumed malice arrives as a shell
# command, so the same destruction expressed in Python — the language the bundle is written
# in — was not merely un-refused, it was CLEAN. Measured on `main`, at the community tier,
# each in its own one-file bundle: `shutil.rmtree(os.path.expanduser("~"))`, `shutil.rmtree(
# "/")`, a `Path("/").rglob("*")` loop calling `unlink`, and `open("/etc/hosts", "w")` all
# scored `clean` with ZERO findings, while `rm -rf /` in a `.sh` next to them was terminal.
# A bundle that deletes the user's home directory installed without a single finding.
#
# THE TIER IS THE OWNER'S RULING, NOT AN INFERENCE. #2607 direction 3 left the severity open
# ("that is a judgement call about the floor and belongs to the owner"). The ruling is that
# native destruction gets the SAME TERMINAL severity as shell destruction, so these rules sit
# in the DANGEROUS band and the floor in `_aggregate` applies to them unchanged — no tier,
# builtin included, downgrades one.
#
# WHY THE SEVERITY TURNS ON THE TARGET AND NOT ON THE CALL. `shutil.rmtree` is a legitimate
# call; cleanup code uses it constantly, and every one of the 64 shipped bundles that calls it
# passes a VARIABLE holding a staging directory. Refusing the call would refuse them all. So
# the claim these rules make is the one the shell band already makes: `rm -rf /tmp/build` is
# not terminal and `rm -rf /` is, and the difference is the target. `_classify_path_literal`
# is that line, and it is drawn to the SAME vocabulary — `/`, `~`, `$HOME` — plus the
# OS-owned trees whose destruction is the same claim (`/etc`, `/usr`, `/System`, …), minus the
# temp roots and character devices that are written every day (`/tmp`, `/var/folders`,
# `/dev/null`). A target the analysis cannot resolve to one of those is NOT flagged: that is a
# recall limit, stated here rather than papered over, and it is what keeps the floor off the
# shipped corpus (measured: 64 bundles, 0 newly DANGEROUS).
#
# WHY THE AST AND NOT A REGEX. This repo has been bitten repeatedly by text scans that match a
# MENTION rather than a call — including a grep that matched a docstring denying the symbol.
# `shutil.rmtree` appears in prose, in a comment warning against it, in a test asserting it is
# never called, and in a denylist of forbidden writers (`design-critique/test_provider.py`
# ships exactly such a list). A regex cannot tell those from a call; `ast` does not have to
# try. So the rule is stated on call targets, resolved through import aliases, and a file that
# does not parse yields NOTHING here rather than a guess.
#
# HOW THIS MEETS THE REACHABILITY SCOPING (#2605, #2625) RATHER THAN GOING AROUND IT. Every
# finding below is `surface="script"` and DANGEROUS, so `_scope_by_reachability` annotates it
# like any other. `_BundleReach.decide` answers REACHABLE for the whole family, and that is
# the only honest answer: L0 and L1 ask whether the match is commentary or a string the file
# merely holds, and a call site is neither. The two directions matter separately —
#   * a commented-out or docstringed destruction produces NO finding at all, which is STRICTER
#     than the WARNING a re-scored regex match would earn: `ast.parse` discards commentary
#     before the rule can see it, so there is nothing to re-score;
#   * a live call is code, so no clause can lower it, and it stays terminal.
# That asymmetry is the #2605 principle applied, not evaded: a commented-out removal really is
# strictly less executable than a live one, and here the gap is the whole finding.
