"""Supply-chain safety — the shared install-time content scanner.

A single, vendor-neutral ``SkillScanner`` that statically inspects **staged**
(not-yet-live) community content — skills AND apps both carry executable code
(``scripts/``, ``setup`` hooks) and become reachable the moment they install, so
both run through this one gate before anything lands live.

The scanner is **pattern + structural, no LLM on the hot path** (an install must
work offline / deterministically). It returns a :class:`ScanReport` with a
:class:`Verdict`; the *decision* (commit / confirm / refuse) is the caller's,
modulated by the source's trust tier. ``dangerous`` is the load-bearing floor:
reserved for high-confidence malice (exfil-to-remote, destructive-root,
obfuscated-exec) so a calculated ``warning`` stays overridable but outright
malware never is.

Reuses ``history._SENSITIVE_TOOL_PATTERNS`` (the credential/secret path set) so
"reads ~/.aws" detection has one source of truth. Not a sandbox — static
inspection only; it reduces risk, it does not contain execution.
