"""Failure-mode taxonomy + typed errors for the model-call chokepoint.

Every attempt through :class:`~gideon.guardrails.model_call.ModelCallGuard`
is classified into exactly one :class:`FailureMode` (or ``None`` on success). The
mode drives two decisions: whether the attempt is retried, and what correction
note is injected into the retry prompt.

The taxonomy is deliberately small and provider-agnostic — it classifies what the
GUARD observed (a timeout, an open breaker, a schema miss), not a vendor's error
code. Vendor SDK exceptions collapse to ``provider_error``; the human-facing
mapping of those stays in ``llm_helpers.humanize_provider_error``.
