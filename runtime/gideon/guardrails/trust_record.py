"""Per-scope trust records — the earned-autonomy ledger behind the rung store (ES-13).

One JSON record per action-type scope, persisted under ``~/.gideon/evals/trust/``.
Each record captures the evidence that licensed the scope's current rung — the same
inputs :func:`gideon.guardrails.autonomy.resolve_rung` already consumes (grant
rung, grant time, evidence window, demotion history) plus the eligibility counters
observed at grant time. The record is written through from ``grant_rung``/``demote``
and read back by ``resolve_rung`` on every decision: a record marked ``revoked``
clamps its scope to the floor until a human re-grants.

Two deliberate rails:

- **One rung dialect.** This module mints NO rung vocabulary. Every rung name it
  stores or validates comes from :data:`gideon.guardrails.autonomy.RUNGS`; a
  record carrying an unknown rung is treated as absent (fail-safe), never coerced.
- **One authority per field.** Grant/demotion mechanics (cooldowns, clamps) stay in
  ``autonomy.py``'s store. The record adds what that store does not have — durable
  per-scope evidence and a ``revoked`` flag — and never overrides a grant upward.

Write failures never block a grant (the grant is the user's decision; the ledger is
its receipt). Read failures never license anything (an unreadable record reads as
revoked=False, absent evidence — exactly the pre-ES-13 behavior).
