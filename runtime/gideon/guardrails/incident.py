"""Incident kill switch (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.3).

One flag — ``~/.gideon/incident.json`` (``{active, reason, started_at}``) —
suspends ALL unattended work within one poll interval. There is no unified trigger
store to flip (six independent stores), so incident mode does NOT mutate stores; it
is checked at the execution seams (cron due-collection, hook fire, event-trigger
fire, autonudge, heartbeat tick, inbox AI, non-interactive subagent spawn). Each
seam gains one ``if incident_active(): skip``.

**Interactive chat is untouched** — the user talking to their assistant during an
incident is the point. Resume is EXPLICIT (``POST /api/incident/resume {confirm}``
or ``gideon incident off``); activation/resume are SEL-audited.

The in-process mirror is refreshed from the file's mtime (the existing mtime-sync
habit), so a flag flipped by the CLI in another process is picked up by the running
gateway without a restart.
