"""Attempt-level JSONL audit trail for the model-call chokepoint (§2.1).

One line per ATTEMPT (not per request) in ``~/.gideon/model_calls.jsonl`` —
so a request that retried once and then fell back writes three lines sharing one
``audit_id``. This is harness mechanics (a file under the config dir), NOT a
memory entry or knowledge item (§7 memory/knowledge boundary): nothing here
writes to ``memory.db`` / ``knowledge.db``.

The file is append-mostly with a trim at 2× the line cap (the ``notifications.jsonl``
pattern the plan cites): each write appends, and when the file crosses ``2 × cap``
lines it is rewritten to the last ``cap`` lines. Trimming at 2× rather than every
write keeps the hot background path append-only in the common case.
