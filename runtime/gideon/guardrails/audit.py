"""Attempt-level JSONL audit trail for the model-call chokepoint (§2.1).

One line per ATTEMPT (not per request) in ``~/.gideon/model_calls.jsonl`` —
so a request that retried once and then fell back writes three lines sharing one
``audit_id``. This is harness mechanics (a file under the config dir), NOT a
memory entry or knowledge item (§7 memory/knowledge boundary): nothing here
writes to ``memory.db`` / ``knowledge.db``.

The file is append-mostly with a trim at 2× the line cap (the ``notifications.jsonl``
pattern the plan cites): each write appends, and when the file crosses ``2 × cap``
lines it is rewritten to the last ``cap`` lines. Trimming at 2× rather than every
write keeps the hot background path append-only in the common case.

# ── caller attribution: WHICH SUBSYSTEM asked for this call (ACP-AGENT-PARITY G47) ──────

#: The CLOSED caller vocabulary. **This tuple is the one definition of "which subsystem
#: asked for a model call"** — a new unattended subsystem adds its name here and binds it
#: with :func:`caller_scope`; no other spelling is accepted anywhere.
#:
#: 🔴 WHY THE FIELD EXISTS. ``use_case`` says which AXIS a call resolved on
#: (``reasoning|background|loops|orchestration``) and FOUR unrelated subsystems share
#: ``background``, so "a background attempt failed" named no subsystem: an expensive
#: learning pass could be dead in production and no surface would say so. Measured on a
#: skill-ladder pass that died as ``provider_error`` at 60,010 ms (`G47`, ex-`K56`) — the
#: row was recorded, and nothing on it or in the log said which pass it was.
#:
#: 🔴 WHY CLOSED. An open string field answers "who asked" in six spellings within a year;
#: this repo has that scar twice over (four verdict dialects, ``loop`` vs ``loops``).
#: :func:`set_current_caller` REFUSES an unlisted value — the same posture
#: ``routing.policy.set_mode`` takes on an unknown mode, and for the same reason: a write
#: path that silently stores a value its readers will not recognise is worse than a loud one.
#:
#: 🔴 WHY THIS IS THE FIRST SUCH VOCABULARY, NOT A SECOND. The SEL's ``caller`` /
#: ``caller_identity`` (``routing/policy.py``, ``model_call.py``'s own SEL record) is a
#: SECURITY-event ACTOR — "who invoked this API", values like ``user`` / ``system`` / a
#: remote address — it names no subsystem and is not a column of this record.
#: ``usage_ledger``'s ``source`` and ``routing.usage.PURPOSES`` are the TURN ledger's axes,
#: one record removed from an attempt, and ``PURPOSES`` is deliberately coarse: every value
#: below maps to its single ``background`` purpose, which is exactly the collapse `G47`
#: reports. So none of the three could carry this without being redefined.
CALLERS: tuple[str, ...] = ("conflict_merge", "inbox_triage", "nl_to_cron", "skill_ladder")

#: What an attempt with no bound caller reads as on a read surface. Interactive chat is
#: deliberately unguarded (``provider_bridge`` attaches the guard on four axes only), and a
#: subsystem that has not been taught to bind is honestly unattributed rather than guessed.
UNATTRIBUTED = "(unattributed)"

#: The AMBIENT caller every guarded model call is attributed to, when one is bound.
#:
#: A ContextVar for the reason ``budgets._CURRENT_RUN_KEY`` is one: the guard is built by
#: ``provider_bridge`` from provider config alone and has no caller identity, so threading a
#: parameter down would touch all 33 call sites that reach the bridge. One seam sets it, one
#: seam reads it (``model_call.ModelCallGuard._audit``).
