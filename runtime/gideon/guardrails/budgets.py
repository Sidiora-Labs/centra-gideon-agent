"""Spend metering + budget ceilings for unattended work (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.1).

The §2 model-call chokepoint is where metering becomes possible — every attempt
carries a token count and a dollar estimate, so the ``SpendMeter`` can fold them
into per-scope counters. A ceiling that bites pauses the run into needs-input
rather than silently overspending.

Two scopes matter for a personal gateway:

* ``run`` — one unattended run (a goal-loop cycle, a cron fire, a subagent). The
  counter is in-memory, keyed by a caller-supplied run key, and reset when the run
  ends. It stops a single runaway from burning a whole day's budget in one go.
* ``day`` — all unattended spend for a calendar day, persisted to
  ``~/.gideon/spend.json`` (atomic_write, pruned >30 days) so it survives a
  restart. It is the real cost guardrail.

Dollar estimates reuse ``pricing.estimate_cost`` (provider-reported cost preferred
by the caller; this is the heuristic fallback, flagged ``estimated``). Budgets
compare against the conservative (higher) estimate — a token ceiling and a dollar
ceiling both apply, either can bite.

This is harness mechanics: ``spend.json`` is a file under the config dir, NOT a
memory entry or knowledge item (§7 boundary).
