"""The user-facing half of the earned-autonomy ladder (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §6.1).

:mod:`~gideon.guardrails.autonomy` decides (ladder, declarations, grants, derived
eligibility) and :mod:`~gideon.guardrails.rungs` routes a dispatch seam. Both are
machine-facing. This module is the third piece: everything a **person** does with the
ladder, and the only place the ladder writes anything a user asked for.

**Three things live here.**

*The inventory* (:func:`ladder_view`) — one row per declared action type carrying the rung
it resolves at, where that rung came from (a declared floor, a grant you clicked, an
incident holding it down), the recomputed track record, and the demotion history. This is
what ``GET /api/autonomy`` serialises and the Settings panel renders, and it is
:func:`~gideon.guardrails.autonomy.promotion_eligibility`'s read-path caller.

*The proposal* (:func:`propose_promotions`) — the ladder's upward path is a click, so a
type that has EARNED its next rung has to say so somewhere the user already looks. This
files one deduped inbox proposal per (type, rung) and is driven by the gateway's daily
scan. It never promotes; it cannot promote, because nothing in this module calls
:func:`~gideon.guardrails.autonomy.grant_rung`.

*The undo* (:func:`reverse_action`) — ``auto_with_undo`` executed something and told the
user they can take it back. This is the executor that actually takes it back:

* The handle is the PROVIDER's (``ActionResult.reversal``) and stays opaque here. Only the
  provider knows what "undo" means for its own effect, so this dispatches
  :meth:`~gideon.action_providers.base.ActionProvider.reverse` on the provider the
  recorded action type declares, and never interprets the handle itself.
* A caller supplies a RECORD ID, never a handle. The handle comes out of our own
  persisted state (``autonomy_reversals.json``, written when the action ran), so a request
  cannot ask to reverse something the system never did — which is the entitlement hazard
  an undo endpoint has.
* **Fail closed, and say which.** An unknown record, an already-reversed one, a handle
  that will not parse, a type whose declaration is gone, a provider that cannot reverse
  that handle kind, a provider that refuses — each is a NAMED refusal that leaves the
  effect in place and, critically, does **not** demote. A demotion on a bogus handle would
  let a malformed request degrade a type's autonomy, which is a downgrade an attacker gets
  for free.
* A SUCCESSFUL reversal demotes the type immediately (``demote``): the user taking an
  automatic action back is the rejection the ladder listens to.

Every refusal and every success is logged AND SEL-audited. A silent clamp is a standing
finding in this tree; an undo that quietly does nothing would be the same defect with a
button on it.
