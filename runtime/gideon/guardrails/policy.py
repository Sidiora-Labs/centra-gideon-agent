"""Named safety profiles (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §3).

Modeled line-for-line on the egress template (``net/policy.py``: a frozen dataclass
+ named module-level profiles + an operator-layering function). A profile is the
single object that decides approval + tool grants + egress + budget + scan for a
run — replacing the ad-hoc ``ToolApprovalPolicy.AUTO_APPROVE`` vs ``HOOK_BASED`` pick
the gateway makes today.

**Headless by construction:** unattended trigger-fired runs resolve through
``HEADLESS`` mechanically, keyed off the session-key conventions that already
classify unattended work (``session._STATELESS_PREFIXES`` + ``loop-*`` workers).
Auto-fired runs default read-only; write/execute is a creation-time grant on the
job/trigger, never acquired mid-run.

Per-template graduated profiles (a WORKFLOWS-V2 template naming ``coding`` /
``review-only`` / ``cleanup``) arrive when that engine lands and consumes
``tool_grants``; until then the profile decides approval + egress + budget + scan
for the unattended paths that exist today.
