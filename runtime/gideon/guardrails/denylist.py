"""Path/action denylist honored by ALL action providers (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.2).

Action providers are pluggable — apps deliver them (``apps/webhook-action``) — so
enforcement CANNOT rely on provider cooperation. ``check_action`` is called at the
THREE dispatch seams every action-provider execution passes through (script hooks,
scheduled jobs, memory-event triggers), so an app-contributed provider inherits the
denylist without knowing it exists.

This is defense-in-depth, not a sandbox: it composes with the always-on built-ins
(``security.is_sensitive_path``, ``baseline_denied_command_patterns``) and the OS
child sandbox, which remains the containment story. What it adds is a *path-level*
denylist for autonomous action-provider runs — the machine-readable analog of the
loop-constraints, configurable via ``security.autonomy_denylist``.
