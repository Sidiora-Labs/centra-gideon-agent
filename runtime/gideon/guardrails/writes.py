"""DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES — the process-wide destructive-write kill (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.4).

``GIDEON_DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES`` is a process-wide env flag, parsed fail-safe
via ``guard_flag`` (only an explicit falsy value disables the guard). It is
**auto-set in conftest for the whole test suite** — PClaw was already bitten by
exactly this bug class: a destructive test with no ``_models_dir`` monkeypatch
deleted the user's real bound local model.

Honored by every LIVE, hard-to-reverse write core owns: external-write action
providers, the local-model ``delete_model``, and ``net.fetch`` non-GET methods to
non-loopback hosts. Each returns/raises a **typed refusal**, never a silent no-op,
so a test asserting a write FAILS loudly instead of passing vacuously. A localhost
write is exempt — it targets the dev gateway itself, not the outside world.
