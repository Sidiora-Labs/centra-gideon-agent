"""Rung ROUTING — what each earned-autonomy rung actually does at a dispatch seam
(AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §5.2).

:mod:`~gideon.guardrails.autonomy` is the decision layer: it holds the ladder, the
declarations, the grants and the derived track record. It shipped with **no call sites**,
which makes it a decision object nothing consults. This module is the other half — the
one the dispatch seams call — and it answers one question:

    given a provider-dispatched action, may it run right now, and what does the user see?

**The four rungs, as behaviour:**

======================  ==========================================================
``draft_only``          Do not execute. File a PROPOSAL inbox item describing what
                        the action would have done.
``one_tap``             Do not execute. File an agent-request inbox item so the
                        user can decide. (The one-tap CARD is AG-8's frontend; the
                        durable row it renders is raised here.)
``auto_with_undo``      Execute, then persist the provider's reversal handle (SEL +
                        the notification's ``meta``) and passively notify — but only
                        when there IS a handle. A notification offering an undo that
                        cannot happen is worse than silence.
``autonomous``          Execute. The SEL row the action already writes is the record.
======================  ==========================================================

**How a declaration reaches a seam with no per-action branching.** A seam holds a
provider NAME (``hook.provider`` / ``trigger.action_provider``) and nothing else. The
name→type mapping lives on the DECLARATION (``ActionTypeSpec.providers``), so
:func:`route_provider_action` is the same three lines for ``bash`` and for an
app-contributed provider nobody in core has heard of. There is no ``if key == …`` at
either seam, and adding a governed action is data.

**An UNDECLARED provider keeps its pre-ladder behaviour.** ``route`` is ``execute`` and
``governed`` is False. This is deliberate and is not a hole: the denylist, the incident
kill switch, the injection screen and the creation-time capability grant all still run —
they are the floor this ladder sits on top of. Treating every undeclared provider as
``draft_only`` would withhold every hook and trigger in the tree, which is an outage
wearing a safety control's clothes. What DOES fail closed is a *declared* key with no
registration and a *granted* rung that cannot be proven: ``resolve_rung`` answers
``draft_only`` for both.

**Two levels, tightest wins** (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5). Level one is the type's own
ceiling, enforced by ``resolve_rung``. Level two is
:func:`~gideon.guardrails.policy.rung_ceiling_for_profile`, which may only NARROW —
so an unattended run cannot reach ``autonomous`` and go silent, whatever the type's
declaration says. Neither level can widen the other.

# 🔴 READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING A FLOOR. These actions ALREADY run unattended today: their
# authority is the creation-time grant on the hook/trigger plus the decision-7 capability
# fence (`triggers/screen.py`), and the ladder was added ON TOP of that floor, never under
# it. So the honest floor for an action that runs today is the rung that matches today's
# behaviour, and declaring one lower would not "harden" anything — it would stop a user's
# existing automations. The recorded lesson is `enforcing a dead control is an outage`.
#
# What the declarations therefore buy is the other three columns: the CEILING (a bound a
# grant can never pass), `leaves_machine` (which keeps `promotion_eligibility` from ever

# ladder panel enumerates. A machine-leaving core action that declares

# asks for — the same claim from an app manifest is clamped (`clamp_untrusted_ceiling`).
