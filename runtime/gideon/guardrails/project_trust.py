"""Project-folder Trust/Preview gate (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §4.3).

Before a project-bound run executes *project* scripts — a project ``<cwd>/loop.md`` picked up by
run-prompt, or a Code-loop deliverable gate running project commands — the first touch of a folder
asks **Trust** vs **Preview**:

* **Trust** → the run may execute project scripts; its declared capability grant stands.
* **Preview** (the safe default, and what an untrusted/undecided folder gets) → the run proceeds
  under ``REVIEW_ONLY``: read-only, no script execution.

Preview maps onto the §4.1 capability class rather than inventing a second read-only mechanism:
:func:`gate_project_capability` forces the spawn's ``capability_class`` to ``research`` for an
untrusted folder, so "REVIEW_ONLY for project-script execution" is the SAME approval-layer denial a
read-only research spawn gets (``subagent._run_inner``). One read-only control, two entry points.

Decisions persist in ``~/.gideon/project_trust.json`` keyed by the RESOLVED directory::

    {"<resolved dir>": {"trusted": bool, "decided_at": "<iso8601>"}}

The FIRST touch of an unknown folder persists a Preview record (so the prompt fires ONCE, not every
fire) and raises a needs-input inbox row asking the user to Trust the folder. An explicit Trust
(:func:`record_project_trust` with ``trusted=True``, exposed at ``POST /api/guardrails/project-
trust``) flips the record; only then does a write grant execute in that folder.

**Fail direction.** Reads are fail-OPEN for the *store* (a corrupt/missing file never crashes a
fire) but fail-CLOSED for the *decision*: absence of a record means Preview (read-only), never
trusted. Note cron scripts are already path-fenced to ``~/.gideon/crons/``
(:func:`schedule_script.resolve_script_path`) — this gate covers the PROJECT-folder gap, not the
cron path.
