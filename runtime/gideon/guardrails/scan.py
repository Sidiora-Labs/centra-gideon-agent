"""Outbound secret/PII scan at the model-call seam (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §2.2).

The network egress chokepoint guards the *transport*; this guards the *content*.
Every outbound prompt bound for a REMOTE provider passes the scan before it leaves
the machine. Local-only providers skip to ``warn`` (the content never leaves).

Builds on what already exists rather than reinventing detection:

* ``security.redact_credentials`` / ``redact_exfiltration_urls`` supply the
  credential + exfil-URL passes (AWS keys, private keys, Slack tokens, base64
  variants, suspicious query strings).
* A small PII pass adds email + phone + long key-shaped strings.

The mode ladder (per ``GuardrailsConfig.scan_mode``, but forced to ``warn`` for
local providers):

* ``warn``   — log the findings + proceed with the ORIGINAL prompt.
* ``redact`` — substitute the findings out, proceed with the CLEANED prompt.
* ``block``  — refuse the call (the caller raises ``SecretLeakBlocked``).
