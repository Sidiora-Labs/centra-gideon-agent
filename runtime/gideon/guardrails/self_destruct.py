"""Refuse an unattended action that would kill the gateway executing it (WF2AUT-14).

🔴 THE HAZARD IS REACHABLE TODAY, and nothing in the product said a word about it. A clock
trigger whose action is a `bash` command dispatches through
:meth:`GatewayOrchestrator._fire_store_trigger` → :func:`gideon.guardrails.denylist.
enforce_action` → :class:`BashActionProvider`, which runs `/bin/sh -c command` and screens
nothing itself. And `gideon stop` / `gideon restart` are **SERVICE-FIRST**: see
`cli_server._restart`, whose first act is `service_controller.restart_service()` — if a
launchd/systemd service manages the gateway, the CLI bounces *that service*, which is the very
process hosting the run. The runner dies mid-flight, so the `ScheduleRunStore` row never reaches
a terminal state and the fire reads afterwards as a HUNG run rather than as a self-inflicted
stop. The user is left debugging a phantom.

**Measured before a line was written.** The packaged baseline
(`security.baseline_denied_command_patterns`) carries exactly three lifecycle-adjacent regexes —
`.*personal.?claw restart.*`,
`.*personal.?claw gateway restart.*` and `.*\\b(kill|pkill|killall)\\b.*\\bpersonal[-.]?claw\\b.*`
— and they are matched against literal text. So:

* `gideon stop`, `gideon update` and `gideon service uninstall` were **not
  screened at all**, though every one of them ends the host process.
* the one spelling that *was* screened fell to a one-line respelling:
  `PC=gideon; $PC restart`, `gideon   restart` (two spaces), `$(which gideon)
  restart` — none of them match, all of them kill the runner.

A screening rule matched against literal text is the bypass class this guard exists to close, so
this module classifies the **EFFECT**: it resolves shell assignments, peels wrapper programs
(`sudo`, `env`, `nohup`, `sh -c`, `python -m`, `uv run`), reduces each simple command to the
program that will actually run, and asks what that program does to *this* process.

**DISTINCT from WF2AUT-9's liveness guard, deliberately.** `skip_if_active` (the signal at
`triggers/service.py:547`, computed by `_target_active_kwargs` at `triggers/service.py:815`)
answers *"is a second CONCURRENT fire of this trigger about to trample work already in
flight?"* — it defers a fire while a worktree is dirty or a lock file is held, and it is
**fail-OPEN** on purpose (a broken `git status` reads as not-busy rather than deferring
forever). This guard answers a different question about a *single* fire: *"will this one fire
destroy its own host?"* One is about concurrency between fires, the other about a fire's effect
on the process running it; one fails open, this one fails **closed**. Neither subsumes the other
— `skip_if_active` would happily admit the only fire in flight, and this guard is indifferent to
how many fires there are.

**Unattended only.** The same operation stays available when a human asks for it: restarting the
gateway is normal administration, and a guard that forbade it outright would be a worse product.
The predicate is the ONE unattendedness decision the codebase already has —
:func:`gideon.guardrails.policy.is_unattended_session` — not a second notion of the word,
and the refusal names the interactive path so the user knows where to go.

**Fail CLOSED, with a bounded closed region.** A guard that refuses too much is an outage, so
"cannot classify" is not "refuse everything": the closed region is commands that reach for our
own CLI, a service manager, a process killer, or an unresolvable program sitting next to a
lifecycle verb. `systemctl restart nginx`, `docker restart my-redis` and `gideon status`
are classified — confidently, as *no host effect* — and pass.

**What this is NOT.** Like the denylist it plugs into, this is defense-in-depth, not a sandbox.
`curl … | sh` and `run-script` pointing at a file whose contents we never read are
unclassifiable by construction; the OS child sandbox remains the containment story. This guard
closes the shape a scheduled automation actually reaches for.
