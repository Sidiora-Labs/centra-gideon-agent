"""Earned-autonomy rung ladder (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §5, amendment 2026-07-26).

The shipped safety floor (§1-§4) is binary: an unattended run is HEADLESS read-only,
or a write is a creation-time grant. There is no graduated middle and no track
record — a reply draft approved unchanged forty times still asks every time. This
module adds the graduated middle ON TOP of that floor. It never relaxes it: a rung
does not override :func:`~gideon.guardrails.denylist.check_action`, a budget
pause, or :func:`~gideon.guardrails.incident.incident_active`.

**The ladder** (:data:`RUNGS`, ordered): ``draft_only`` → ``one_tap`` →
``auto_with_undo`` → ``autonomous``. Every autonomous WRITE action carries a stable
type key (``inbox.reply_draft``, ``sessions.auto_tag``, ``app:<name>.<action>``) and
an :class:`ActionTypeSpec` declaring the floor it starts at and the ceiling it can
never pass.

**Asymmetric by design — the property that makes this safe:**

* **Promotion is ALWAYS a user click.** :func:`promotion_eligibility` is a *derived
  proposal*: it reports that a type has earned the next rung and nothing else. It
  writes nothing, and no code path in this module promotes on its own.
* **Demotion is automatic and immediate.** :func:`demote` drops the type back to its
  floor on the FIRST rejection, undo, or 👎, and starts a cooldown during which the
  type cannot become eligible again.

**The track record is DERIVED, never stored as an opinion.** Eligibility is recomputed
on every call from two evidence sources that already exist:

* the SEL (``security_events.jsonl``) — human approval verdicts on tool invocations,
  attributed to a type by the ``action_type`` metadata key the dispatch seams stamp
  (:data:`SEL_ACTION_TYPE_KEY`) or by an ``operation`` equal to the type key;
* FEEDBACK-SIGNAL records (``feedback.jsonl``) — a 👎 on that type's output, attributed
  by a ``producer_id`` equal to the type key.

Only *grants* and *demotions* persist, to ``~/.gideon/autonomy_rungs.json``
(``atomic_write``, joins the snapshot ``CORE_FILES``). Storing the derived record
would let a stale count outlive the evidence it summarised, which is exactly the
opinion this module refuses to hold.

**Fail closed, everywhere.** An unreadable or corrupt store grants nothing (it cannot
prove a grant, so there is none). An unknown rung name never resolves above the floor.
An unregistered type key resolves to ``draft_only`` — no declaration, no autonomy.
Auto-approvals deliberately do NOT count as evidence: counting them would let a type
that already runs unattended manufacture its own promotion case.

Thresholds come from the ``guardrails.autonomy`` config subsection (operator-wide
defaults); a type that declares its own :class:`PromotionRule` on its spec keeps it.
