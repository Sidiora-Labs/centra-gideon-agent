"""``ModelCallGuard`` — the model-call chokepoint adapter (§2.1).

The LLM twin of ``net.fetch``: a :class:`~gideon.llm.base.ModelProvider`
that wraps the resolved provider for **non-interactive** calls and enforces, per
stream, the cheap-first pipeline this slice owns:

    circuit-breaker check  →  call with hard wall-clock timeout  →  attempt audit

Later stages (secret/PII scan, spend metering, typed-output enforcement, ordered
fallback) compose in front of / behind this same seam in Sessions 2–4.

**Where it wraps (and where it must NOT):** the wrap happens inside the bridge's
single provider-build point (``_resolve_from_config_registry``) gated on the
non-interactive chat-text use case. That gate excludes, by construction, both the
interactive ``NativeAgentRuntime`` (returned before the build point for
``chat``/``code_tools``) and its inner model (resolved with ``chat``/``code_tools``
+ ``_force_model_axis``) — the interactive chat stream a human is watching is
explicitly out of scope for v1.

The guard is a faithful transparent proxy: every ``ModelProvider`` method
delegates to the wrapped provider; only :meth:`stream` / :meth:`complete` (the two
generation paths) are intercepted.
