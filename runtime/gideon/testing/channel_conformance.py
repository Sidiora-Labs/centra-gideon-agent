"""The channel conformance kit (CHANNEL-EXPANSION C4) — one contract, four channels.

Before this module, each channel app asserted *its own idea* of the transport contract:
Telegram pinned its capability dict, Discord pinned its intents bitfield, email pinned
its IMAP cursor. All useful, none shared — so a fifth author had nothing to check a new
transport against, and a clause every existing channel happened to honour (fence the
non-owner content, throttle the edit stream) was nowhere written down as an obligation.

``assert_channel_contract`` is that written-down obligation, executable. Given a live
provider instance it drives the clauses the plan's §C4 names:

1. **identity + info** — ``name``/``display_name`` are non-empty strings and ``info()``
   projects them plus the capability dict.
2. **connect/send echo shapes** — ``connect()``/``disconnect()`` are awaitable and
   return the declared types; ``send()`` returns a bool and never raises for a
   well-formed :class:`OutboundMessage`.
3. **capabilities() completeness** — every field of the shipped
   :class:`ChannelCapabilities` dataclass is present in ``to_dict()`` with its declared
   type (a transport cannot ship a half-populated or extended capability dict).
4. **receive() honesty** — a transport declaring ``inbound`` must have an inbound path;
   one that does not must not pretend (see the ``inbound_via`` note below).
5. **health/test shapes** — ``health()`` returns ``{state, detail}`` with ``state`` in
   the closed set; ``test()`` returns ``{ok: bool, detail: str}``, consistent with
   health.
6. **unknown-sender flow** — an unpaired DM sender under the default ``pairing`` policy
   is denied, gets the canned pairing reply, and raises exactly one owner attention item
   (``kind="agent_request"``), deduped for a second message from the same sender.
7. **fencing of non-owner content** — tracked-group content from a non-owner sender
   comes back fenced (``security.is_fenced``), and the transport is asserted to consume
   ``verdict.fenced_text`` rather than the raw text.
8. **streaming throttle where declared** — only when the transport declares
   ``edits=True`` *and* the caller supplies a ``delivery`` + injectable clock: at most
   one edit per ``min_edit_interval``, and ``stop_stream`` force-flushes the exact final
   text. A transport declaring ``edits=False`` (email) is asserted the other way: its
   ``start_stream`` must return ``""`` so core skips animation entirely.
9. **vendor-seam completeness (ADVISORY)** — the only clause that WARNS instead of
   failing: a provider whose owning ``app.json`` registers a ``channel`` provider but no
   ``inbox`` message source gets a ``UserWarning`` naming the missing seam (amendment
   2026-07-26 rule 1). Suppress it with ``no_inbox_source_reason=`` when the vendor has no
   message-source semantics. See ``_warn_on_incomplete_vendor_seams`` for why an advisory
   rather than a failure, and ``docs/guides/build-a-channel-app.md`` for the checklist.

Failures name the violated obligation, not just the expression, because the reader is
usually an app author who has never seen this file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Export-path decision (T7.1 "export path decision recorded") — DEVIATION from the
atom's literal ``tests/channel_conformance.py``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plan (line 52, §C4) names ``tests/channel_conformance.py`` in core, "exported for
app use". That path cannot satisfy the atom's own done-when ("all four apps pass the kit
in **apps-repo CI**"), for two verified reasons:

* **``tests/`` is not in the distribution.** ``pyproject.toml`` line 183-184 declares
  ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find] where = ["src"]`` — only ``src/gideon`` is
  packaged — and ``MANIFEST.in`` grafts exactly one extra tree (``graft web/dist``).
  Nothing under ``tests/`` reaches a wheel or an sdist, and ``tests/`` has no
  ``__init__.py``, so it is not even an importable package in-tree.
* **The apps repo installs core as a distribution.** ``.github/workflows/ci.yml``
  installs ``gideon @ git+https://github.com/Gideon/Gideon@main``
  into a uv venv. An app test can import only what that install carries. A
  ``from tests.channel_conformance import …`` would pass on a developer machine that
  happens to have the core repo on ``sys.path`` and fail in CI — the worst kind of green.

So the kit lives in the installed package (``gideon/testing/channel_conformance.py``)
and is re-exported through ``gideon.sdk.channel`` — the same facade every channel
app already imports its transport ABC and trust API from, and the boundary the apps-side
import lint enforces. ``tests/`` keeps no shim: a shim would be a second import path for
one helper, and core's own kit-driving test imports the package path like an app does,
so the path apps use is the path core exercises.

Rejected alternative: vendoring a copy per app. Four copies of a contract drift the
moment one channel is edited, which is the exact failure this kit exists to end.

This module deliberately does **not** import ``pytest``: it raises ``AssertionError``
with named obligations, so it is usable from a pytest test, a plain script, or an app's
own harness.
