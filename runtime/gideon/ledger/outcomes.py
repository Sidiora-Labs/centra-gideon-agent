"""The outcome record — one facility for every producer that makes a bet (PP-9).

The platform records what it DID and never what LANDED. That single shape is what produces loop
output nobody reads, unmeasured routing edges, and the declared-but-inert class this repo keeps
rediscovering by AST audit rather than at runtime.

The mechanism to fix it already existed and was scoped to one feature: LEARN-R18's
`pending_outcome` / `outcome_resolved` pair, openable only by a decision-producing workflow node,
with `instance_path`/`node_id`/`epoch` welded into the record shape. This module is that same pair
with the decision assumptions lifted out of it, so ANY producer may open a question:

* a **decision** — the original: this run chose `subject`, and `metric` will reveal whether it was
  right (`PRODUCER_DECISION`);
* a **published artifact** — we produced a deliverable; did anyone consume it (`PRODUCER_PUBLISH`);
* an **escalation** — we interrupted the user; did they answer (`PRODUCER_ESCALATION`);
* a **proposal** or a **declared control** — we asked for something, or we declared a rail; did it
  ever fire (`PRODUCER_PROPOSAL`, `PRODUCER_CONTROL`).

There is exactly ONE outcome facility, and this is it. PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT's `PA-4` decision
journal lands here as a producer (`PRODUCER_DECISION` with its own `context` fields), not as a
second decision-shaped pair beside this one — the whole point of generalizing was to make that
second facility unnecessary before it is written.

Three invariants survive the generalization unchanged, because each of them is why the original
worked:

**Idempotency via `pending_event_id`.** Every resolution cites the `event_id` of the question it
closes, so :func:`open_questions` can subtract the answered ones from the asked ones by set
membership. A second resolver tick over the same ledger writes nothing. No timestamps, no
"already done" flag file, no lock — the ledger IS the state.

**`measured` is distinct from `inconclusive`.** A question whose ground truth could not be read
after its horizon still CLOSES — otherwise a permanently unreadable metric re-resolves forever —
but it closes as weaker evidence. The two resolutions carry different decay profiles
(:data:`DECAY_PROFILE`) and different proposal-queue tiers, so an outcome we could not measure
ages out fast instead of masquerading as a confirmed one.

**Ground truth has a declared SOURCE.** A decision's metric lives in semantic memory; an
escalation's lives in the producer's own ledger (did a `confirmation_resolved` citing this
confirmation ever appear?). Naming the source on the question is what lets one resolver grade both
without a per-producer branch, and what keeps ledger-sourced questions resolvable on a box with no
vector store.

Nothing here imports `gideon.workflows` (there is an AST rail): the workflow-shaped
adapters — the ones that stamp `instance_path`/`node_id`/`epoch` — stay in `workflows/journal.py`
over :meth:`OutcomeLedger.open_outcome`.
