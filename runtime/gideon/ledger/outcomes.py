"""The outcome record — one facility for every producer that makes a bet (PP-9).

The platform records what it DID and never what LANDED. That single shape is what produces loop
output nobody reads, unmeasured routing edges, and the declared-but-inert class this repo keeps
rediscovering by AST audit rather than at runtime.

The mechanism to fix it already existed and was scoped to one feature: LEARN-R18's
`pending_outcome` / `outcome_resolved` pair, openable only by a decision-producing workflow node,
with `instance_path`/`node_id`/`epoch` welded into the record shape. This module is that same pair
with the decision assumptions lifted out of it, so ANY producer may open a question:

* a **decision** — the original: this run chose `subject`, and `metric` will reveal whether it was
  right (`PRODUCER_DECISION`);
* a **published artifact** — we produced a deliverable; did anyone consume it (`PRODUCER_PUBLISH`);
* an **escalation** — we interrupted the user; did they answer (`PRODUCER_ESCALATION`);
* a **proposal** or a **declared control** — we asked for something, or we declared a rail; did it
  ever fire (`PRODUCER_PROPOSAL`, `PRODUCER_CONTROL`).

There is exactly ONE outcome facility, and this is it. PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT's `PA-4` decision
journal lands here as a producer (`PRODUCER_DECISION` with its own `context` fields), not as a
second decision-shaped pair beside this one — the whole point of generalizing was to make that
second facility unnecessary before it is written.

Three invariants survive the generalization unchanged, because each of them is why the original
worked:

**Idempotency via `pending_event_id`.** Every resolution cites the `event_id` of the question it
closes, so :func:`open_questions` can subtract the answered ones from the asked ones by set
membership. A second resolver tick over the same ledger writes nothing. No timestamps, no
"already done" flag file, no lock — the ledger IS the state.

**`measured` is distinct from `inconclusive`.** A question whose ground truth could not be read
after its horizon still CLOSES — otherwise a permanently unreadable metric re-resolves forever —
but it closes as weaker evidence. The two resolutions carry different decay profiles
(:data:`DECAY_PROFILE`) and different proposal-queue tiers, so an outcome we could not measure
ages out fast instead of masquerading as a confirmed one.

**Ground truth has a declared SOURCE.** A decision's metric lives in semantic memory; an
escalation's lives in the producer's own ledger (did a `confirmation_resolved` citing this
confirmation ever appear?); a published artifact's lives on the ARTIFACT — did a consumer ever touch
it (:data:`SOURCE_CONSUMPTION`, PP-10). Naming the source on the question is what lets one resolver
grade all three without a per-producer branch, and what keeps ledger- and consumption-sourced
questions resolvable on a box with no vector store.

`PP-10` reads this facility rather than counting alongside it: a work unit whose last
:data:`DORMANCY_CYCLES` published artifacts all resolved `UNCONSUMED` is :data:`DORMANT`
(:func:`dormancy_verdict`), which becomes a PROPOSAL to pause or retire it and never an automatic
stop — "nobody looked yet" and "nobody will ever look" are different facts and only the user knows
which.

Nothing here imports `gideon.workflows` (there is an AST rail): the workflow-shaped
adapters — the ones that stamp `instance_path`/`node_id`/`epoch` — stay in `workflows/journal.py`
over :meth:`OutcomeLedger.open_outcome`.

#: the same fact as "the metric is unreadable".
SOURCE_MEMORY = "memory"
#: A later event in the producer's OWN ledger. `metric` is the event kind, `match` the fields it
#: must carry, `value_field` the number to read off it (absent ⇒ mere presence scores 1.0).
#: Resolvable with no memory service at all.
SOURCE_LEDGER = "ledger"
#: A CONSUMER TOUCH on the thing the producer landed (PP-10). Neither a semantic key nor an event in
#: the producer's own log: the reader is a person on a surface the run cannot see, and their touch
#: is recorded on the OBJECT (an artifact's lifecycle timeline, the dashboard pin list) by writers
#: that already exist. Naming it as a third source is what keeps ONE resolver — the alternative is a
#: `if producer == publish` branch inside the grader, which is how the facility ended up
#: decision-shaped the first time. The reader lives in `learning.consumer_liveness`, because

#: whole bet", and a reader comparing against a bare literal would not say why.
CONSUMED = 1.0
UNCONSUMED = 0.0

#: How many consecutive MATURED, unconsumed cycles make a work unit a dormancy candidate. Three,
#: because the field post-mortem this exists for is a pipeline that ran dead for MONTHS — one
#: unopened deliverable is a busy week, three in a row past their horizons is a pattern — and
#: because a sweep that fires on cycle one trains the user to skim past the surface it reports on,

LIVE = "live"

#: from "nobody reads this", and collapsing either into `DORMANT` is exactly how the control gets
#: teeth it has not earned.
