"""The ledger's event vocabulary — one registry, shared by every producer.

These names were born inside the workflow engine, but nothing about them is workflow-shaped: a
`step_started` is "a unit of work began", a `judge_verdict` is "something assessed something", a
`breaker_trip` is "a loop was cut off". The vocabulary lives here rather than in
`workflows/journal.py` so a second producer can speak it without importing the engine — which is
the only alternative that keeps ONE vocabulary. A loop that emitted its own `cycle_finished`
alongside `step_completed` would not be a second producer of the ledger; it would be a fifth
dialect for a reader to reconcile, which is the failure the extraction exists to prevent.

Adding a kind is therefore additive here and nowhere else: the constant, its comment saying what
question the kind answers, and (if a refiner must read it) an entry in :data:`LEDGER_KINDS`.

STEP_STARTED = "step_started"
STEP_COMPLETED = "step_completed"
STEP_FAILED = "step_failed"
STEP_SKIPPED = "step_skipped"
STEP_CACHED = "step_cached"
#: One try at one node — typed, so a retry gets actionable feedback rather than prose,
#: and so the flywheel can later see WHICH corrections actually worked (WF2-R4).
STEP_ATTEMPT = "step_attempt"
#: Retries spent or the breaker tripped — a typed decision record, not a bare failure.
STEP_ESCALATED = "step_escalated"
GATE_REJECTED = "gate_rejected"
GATE_CRITERION = "gate_criterion"
#: A human answered a waiting gate (WF2-R7). Journaled with the answer so a later reader
#: knows WHO decided what, not merely that the run continued.
GATE_RESOLVED = "gate_resolved"
#: A reviewer answered a gate with `revise{step_ref, comment}` (UP): one step was patched and the
#: gate re-asks. A DISTINCT kind from `gate_resolved` on purpose — a revise is neither an approval
#: nor a rejection, and folding it into the resolved event would make `introspection.gate_stats`
#: count it as a said-no, reporting a reviewer who asked for a wording change as one who declined
#: the work.
GATE_REVISED = "gate_revised"
EFFECT = "effect"
#: A node wrote outside its declared `allowed_write_paths` (WF2-R19). Ledgered whether
#: the mode was warn or reject — an escape a `warn` run continued past still has to be
#: findable afterwards.
STEP_SCOPE = "step_scope_violation"
ITERATION = "iteration"
USER_EDITED_MID_FLIGHT = "user_edited_mid_flight"
#: A queued batch failed its TOCTOU re-verify (state moved under the preview). Journaled
#: because a silently dropped mutation is indistinguishable from an applied one.
MUTATION_REJECTED = "mutation_rejected"
#: A done node whose inputs changed but which is NOT being re-run (WF2-R2 #3) — better a
#: visible flag than an answer computed from inputs that no longer exist.
INPUTS_STALE = "inputs_stale"
CONSULTED = "consulted"
CHILD_RUN_ATTACH = "child_run_attach"
RUN_ABANDONED = "run_abandoned"
CRYSTALLIZED = "crystallized"
#: Context-lifecycle records (WF2-R6). Journaled rather than held in memory so a rewind or fork
#: REPLAYS them — a handoff reconstructed after the fact is a summary, which is the thing it exists
#: to replace.
HANDOFF = "handoff"
CARRYOVER = "carryover"
DECISION = "decision"
RUN_STARTED = "run_started"
RUN_FINISHED = "run_finished"
#: LOOPS-EVOLUTION R4/R14: the middleware's own observable events. `breaker_trip` and
#: `steering` are ledger kinds because a refiner needs to know a run was nudged or
#: steered — a verdict that followed a human's mid-run instruction is not evidence about
#: the template, and without the event there is no way to tell the two apart.
BREAKER_TRIP = "breaker_trip"
STEERING = "steering"
#: WV-13: one `foreach` with `on_item_error: collect` finished, and these items failed. A ledger
#: kind because COLLECT's whole contract is "run everything, then hand me the failures" — the
#: failures ARE the deliverable, and a fan-out that fails the run without saying which of its
#: fifty items broke has collected nothing. One record per fan-out per epoch, not one per item:
#: the point is the set, and a reader that had to reassemble it from fifty `step_failed` records
#: would have to know the fan-out's item-path shape to do it.
ITEMS_COLLECTED = "items_collected"
JUDGE_VERDICT = "judge_verdict"
JUDGE_DIVERGENCE = "judge_divergence"
#: KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §4: long-run watcher mechanics. `watcher_reaped` is a ledger kind
#: because a watcher stopped early produced fewer cycles than its cadence implies, and a
#: refiner reading cycle counts without it would conclude the template under-performed.
#: `seen_set` and `buffer_seal` are what make a months-long run's cost auditable — the whole
#: point of the seen-set is invisible without a record of what it suppressed.
WATCHER_REAPED = "watcher_reaped"
SEEN_SET = "seen_set"
BUFFER_SEAL = "buffer_seal"
DELAY_CLAMPED = "delay_clamped"

#: LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 (LEARN-R18): the pending→resolved outcome lifecycle. A
#: decision-producing run journals `pending_outcome` {subject, metric, horizon, baseline}
#: AT DECISION TIME — before the outcome is knowable — and the curator's resolver writes
#: `outcome_resolved` once the horizon has elapsed and ground truth has been measured. Both
#: are ledger kinds because a decision's later outcome is the richest refiner signal there
#: is, and a `pending_outcome` with no matching `outcome_resolved` is the "open question"
#: retention must never evict. Keyed to each other by `pending_event_id`, so the resolver is
#: idempotent — a second curator tick finds the resolution and skips.
PENDING_OUTCOME = "pending_outcome"
OUTCOME_RESOLVED = "outcome_resolved"

#: TASKS-SOPS §1/§4/§5 (S61e): the task-projection events. Ledger kinds rather than a parallel
#: channel, because every one of them answers a question a reader asks of the ledger and nowhere
#: else: WHY does this task exist (`task_materialized`), WHO answered this gate
#: (`confirmation_pending`/`confirmation_resolved`), WHAT evidence flipped it (`task_verified`),
#: and WHICH upstream failure blocked it (`cascade_blocked`). Without them a projected task's whole
#: provenance is invisible — the board shows a task and the ledger shows the run, with nothing
#: connecting the two.
TASK_MATERIALIZED = "task_materialized"
CONFIRMATION_PENDING = "confirmation_pending"
CONFIRMATION_RESOLVED = "confirmation_resolved"
TASK_VERIFIED = "task_verified"
CASCADE_BLOCKED = "cascade_blocked"

#: WORK-CONTAINERS §4.1 (WF2WOR-4): what happened to the run's workspace. A ledger kind because
#: WHERE a run worked changes how its result reads — a stage that failed on a missing dependency
#: after a setup step failed is a different fact from one that failed on its own logic, and a
#: refiner comparing two runs of one template cannot tell them apart without this. `teardown` is
#: separate because it fires long after the run, on a deletion path, and folding it into the
#: provisioning record would mean rewriting a journal line after the run ended.
WORKSPACE_PROVISIONED = "workspace_provisioned"
WORKSPACE_TEARDOWN = "workspace_teardown"

#: The subset a downstream refiner reads. Named so a drift test can assert the engine
#: still emits all of them.
