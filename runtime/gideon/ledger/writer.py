"""The append/stamp/spill machinery — everything a ledger does that has nothing to do with what
kind of work is being ledgered.

`LedgerWriter` is deliberately not usable on its own: it has no idea where its files live. A
producer subclasses it, binds :attr:`LedgerWriter._store` to its own run-scoped file store, and adds
whatever typed emitters its domain needs. Everything below the emitters — sequencing, stamping,
redaction, the ledger mirror, the oversize/binary spill and the resume-cache fold — is identical for
every producer, and is the part that must never be re-implemented: a second copy of the spill
boundary is a second answer to "how big is too big", and the two would drift.

        read inline; anything past the boundary leaves a typed `result_omitted` stub so a
        reader knows the data exists rather than seeing a truncated string it might parse.

        Two spill reasons, both about what an inline value costs downstream:

        * `oversize` — over :data:`MAX_INLINE_OUTPUT_BYTES`. The same boundary the live chat
          sanitizer uses; a 5MB tool result must not become a 5MB journal line that every
          later read re-parses, nor a 5MB SSE frame.
        * `binary` — a magic-prefix match (PNG, JPEG, PDF, gzip, zip, ELF…). Detected by
          CONTENT, not size: a 400-byte PNG is under every threshold and still meaningless
          inline — it would render as mojibake in the widget, poison a `{{nodes.x.output}}`
          binding, and (if it reached a model) burn context on noise. Path-agnostic because
          a node's output is not a filename.

        WV-11: an inline output is written to `outputs/`, byte-identical to before. An OFFLOADED
        one is written to `runs/<id>/artifacts/` instead, so its `output_ref` does NOT start
        with `outputs/` — the signal every reader uses to treat it as a fetch-on-demand pointer
        (`{{nodes.x.artifact}}`, the `artifact_inspect` provider). The oversize stub keeps a
        head+tail `preview` (both ends of the serialized body, not just the head) so a truncated
        view still shows where the value starts AND ends; a binary stub omits it, because a slice
        of a PNG is noise. The stub always carries `bytes` and `output_ref`, so the full value
        stays one read away and the stub itself explains why it is a stub.
