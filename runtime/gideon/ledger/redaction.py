    poisoned `{{nodes.x.output}}` binding, wasted context if it reaches a model.

    Both carriers are checked. Raw bytes decoded into a `str` are recovered with latin-1
    (which maps codepoints 0-255 back to the identical bytes) rather than UTF-8 — a PNG's
    leading `\\x89` UTF-8-encodes to TWO bytes, so a UTF-8 round-trip silently fails to match
    any magic number, which is exactly the bug this comment exists to prevent. Base64 is the
    other carrier, and in practice the more common one.
