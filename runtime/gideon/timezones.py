"""The ONE place a wall-clock timezone is resolved (#2520).

**The defect this module exists to remove, measured before writing it.** A clock trigger
authored as `{"kind": "cron", "expr": "30 8 * * *"}` with no `spec.timezone` armed to
**08:30 UTC**. On this host (`/etc/localtime -> …/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles`) that is
**01:30 PDT** — the product returned `1788769800.0` where an 08:30-where-the-user-is
reminder is `1788795000.0`, a **-7 h** error. Nothing warned; the trigger armed happily.
Six functions had each derived their own answer to the same question:

    triggers/arm.py:44                _trigger_tz()     spec.timezone           → UTC
    schedule.py:445                   _job_tz()         job.timezone → config   → UTC
    schedule.py:432                   get_local_tz()    config                  → UTC  (!)
    triggers/calendar.py:564          _resolve_zone()   spec → config           → server-local
    knowledge/research_reports.py:396 _report_tz()      defn.tz → get_local_tz  → UTC
    knowledge/report_schedules.py:76  _effective_tz()   defn.tz → get_local_tz  → ""   (= UTC)

They did not agree. `get_local_tz()` — a function whose *name* is "local" — returned
`('UTC', ZoneInfo('UTC'))` on a PDT host, and it is what the Triggers and Calendar pages
report as `server_tz`. `_resolve_zone()` fell through to **server-local**, so the week grid
struck a different calendar column than the fire path used — the one thing its docstring
promises it will not do. `_effective_tz()` was written *specifically* to compensate for
`arm`'s UTC default and resolved to `'UTC'` itself whenever `config.timezone` was blank,
which is the case on a stock install. Every author rediscovered the pattern, and got a
slightly different one; that divergence, not the missing default, is the real cost.

**Absent and invalid are two different facts.** An invalid zone is a typo: the author
thought about timezones and mistyped. An *absent* zone means they never thought about
timezones at all — and for a local-first personal tool whose surface is "remind me at
08:30", UTC is close to the least likely thing they meant. So:

    1. an EXPLICIT name (spec.timezone / job.timezone / defn.tz)
         → used, or REFUSED with `UnknownTimeZone` if it is not an IANA key. A typo is a
           loud error where it is authored (`arm.semantic_spec_issues` turns it into a
           create-time ERROR; `cli_setup` re-prompts), never a silent 7-hour shift.
    2. `AppConfig.timezone`
         → an *ambient default*, not an authored fact about this row, so an unusable one
           is logged and SKIPPED rather than raised. Bricking every automation over one
           bad config line is not proportionate, and the only write path for that field
           (`gideon setup`) already refuses a typo at the prompt.
    3. the MACHINE's zone — `TZ`, then the `/etc/localtime` symlink, then `/etc/timezone`.
    4. UTC, last resort, only when the machine zone genuinely cannot be determined. The
       doctor reports this as a WARNING naming the consequence (`zone_report`), because a
       silent UTC is exactly the footgun this module removes.

**`time.tzname` is not usable** as the machine-zone source and must not be reintroduced:
it yields abbreviations (`PDT`, `CEST`) which `ZoneInfo` rejects. The `/etc/localtime`
symlink target is the workable route on macOS and Linux. Some container images *copy*
`/etc/localtime` instead of symlinking it — then there is no name in the path, and
`/etc/timezone` (Debian/Alpine) or `TZ` is the only remaining source; when none answers,
that is the honest path to the UTC last resort.

Nothing here is cached. A resolution is a `readlink` plus (at most) one `AppConfig.load()`,
which is what `_job_tz` already cost per computation, and a cache would make a corrected
config or a changed host zone require a restart to take effect.

`tests/test_timezone_resolution_has_one_owner.py` is the rail: this module is the only
place in `src/gideon/` allowed to construct a `ZoneInfo`, read `/etc/localtime`, or
touch `time.tzname`. A seventh hand-rolled resolver reds it.
