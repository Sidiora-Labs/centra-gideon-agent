"""SheetModel → .xlsx bytes (openpyxl).

Cell TYPES are preserved deliberately: a spreadsheet whose numbers arrived as text can't
be summed or charted, which defeats the purpose of generating one.

**A formula is written as a formula, and a literal is written as a literal — because the
model says which it is.** openpyxl decides a cell's type by SNIFFING the string it is
given: ``cell.value = "=SUM(A1)"`` becomes a formula, and so does
``cell.value = "=WORK IN PROGRESS"``, which Excel then opens as ``#NAME?``. Sniffing is
wrong in both directions, so this writer never lets it happen: a
:class:`~gideon.documents.model.SheetCell` with a ``formula`` is written through
the formula path, and one with only a ``value`` is pinned to the string type when it
would otherwise be mistaken for an expression.
