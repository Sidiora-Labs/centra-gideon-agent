"""DeckModel → .pptx bytes (python-pptx).

Uses the template's real TITLE + BODY placeholders rather than free-floating text boxes.
That matters for more than tidiness: the pptx reader identifies a slide's title via
``slide.shapes.title``, so a deck built from text boxes would round-trip with every title
lost — and so would PowerPoint's own outline view.

**A bullet's depth is written, not assumed.** This writer used to pin ``level = 0`` on
every appended paragraph, so a nested outline came out of the model flat: the depth was
not lost in the file, it was never written. ``documents/pptx_parser.py`` reads the same
attribute back, which is what makes depth a round trip rather than a one-way flatten.
