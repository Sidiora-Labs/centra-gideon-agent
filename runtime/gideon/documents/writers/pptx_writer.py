Uses the template's real TITLE + BODY placeholders rather than free-floating text boxes.
That matters for more than tidiness: the pptx reader identifies a slide's title via
``slide.shapes.title``, so a deck built from text boxes would round-trip with every title
lost — and so would PowerPoint's own outline view.
