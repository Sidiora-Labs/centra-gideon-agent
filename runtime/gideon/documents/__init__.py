"""Document generation — the write half of the formats knowledge already reads.

`knowledge/readers.py` extracts text from .docx/.pdf/.pptx/.xlsx; this package renders
them. One declarative model per shape (document / sheet / deck), one pure writer per
format, one registry. Adding a format is a writer plus a registration — never a sweep.

The agent never emits OOXML. It supplies markdown (which it is already good at) or a
declarative model, and code renders the file. No vendor file-format vocabulary appears
outside ``writers/``.
