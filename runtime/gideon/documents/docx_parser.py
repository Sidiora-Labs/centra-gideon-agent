""".docx bytes → (DocumentModel, LossReport). The read half of the docx writer.

This module is the SECOND place OOXML wordprocessingml vocabulary is allowed, and for the
same reason as the first: inverting a file format is the parser's whole job. The contract
is one-directional — vendor vocabulary comes IN, only `documents/model.py` types go OUT.
Nothing downstream of `parse_docx` ever sees a `w:` tag.

(Note the package docstring's "no vendor file-format vocabulary appears outside
``writers/``" predates a reader existing at all. The honest statement of the rule is
"vendor vocabulary is confined to the format-specific edge modules"; a future `readers/`
subpackage is where this belongs once there is more than one.)

Two things make a parser trustworthy, and both are contracts, not effort:

**Order is preserved by construction.** python-docx exposes `doc.paragraphs` and
`doc.tables` as two independent sequences, so any parser that iterates them in turn emits
every paragraph before every table and silently reorders the document. This one walks the
body element's own children, which IS document order.

**Every loss is named.** The model deliberately describes a small, portable document; a
real .docx holds far more (footnotes, comments, merged cells, tracked changes, text
boxes, arbitrary character formatting). Dropping those quietly is the failure mode that
makes a "fidelity" editor untrustworthy, so each one appends a `LossItem` saying WHAT was
dropped and WHERE. A construct the model cannot express and that produces no item is a
bug in this module, not an acceptable simplification.

## The writer's conventions, inverted

`writers/docx_writer.py` expresses two model properties through a convention rather than
a dedicated OOXML feature, because the default template cannot be relied on to define the
styles that would otherwise carry them. Each inverse below is therefore load-bearing: get
it wrong and a document THIS repo wrote fails to round-trip.

* A `code` run is written as the font `Courier New` (no code character style exists), so
  a run in that font reads back as `Run(code=True)`. A run in any *other* explicit font
  is a `run_property` loss — the model has no font field.
* A hyperlink is written as a real `w:hyperlink` plus an explicit colour `0563C1` and a
  single underline (the `Hyperlink` character style is not guaranteed to exist). Inside a
  hyperlink those two exact values are therefore the link's own decoration and are
  CONSUMED by `Run.link`; any other colour or underline style inside a link, and any
  colour or underline outside one, is reported.
* An `image` block is written as the placeholder paragraph ``[image: <slug>]`` (the block
  references an artifact and the writer has no store), so a lone unformatted paragraph of
  exactly that shape reads back as an `image` block. A user's literal ``[image: x]``
  paragraph is reclassified by this rule; the text survives byte-identically either way,
  which is why the round trip is stable regardless.
* `code` vs `paragraph` is genuinely ambiguous in the output: a `code` block and a
  `paragraph` whose every run is `code=True` render to the same OOXML. This parser reads
  an all-monospace paragraph as a `code` block, which is the inverse of the writer's
  plain-text path; the alternative reading loses nothing either, and both are stable
  under re-render.
