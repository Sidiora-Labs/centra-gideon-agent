"""JSON⇄:class:`SheetModel` — the ONLY shape a spreadsheet crosses the wire in.

The sheet half of what ``model_json.py`` does for a text document, and for the same
reasons: the grid editor edits the *model*, never the bytes, so the server parses an
.xlsx into a model, hands the model to the browser, takes a model back, and re-renders it
with the shipped writer. No OOXML is constructed in a browser, and that is a property of
this boundary rather than a convention somebody remembers.

Separate module, not a second pair of functions inside ``model_json.py``: the two models
share no node type, so folding them together would produce one file whose every function
belonged to only half of it.

**Serialization is ``asdict``** for ``model_json.py``'s reason — a hand-written mapper is
one forgotten line from dropping a field the writer still emits.
:attr:`~gideon.documents.model.Sheet.rows` is a derived property and therefore
absent from ``asdict`` by construction, which is the point: the wire carries cells, and
the plain view is computed wherever it is needed rather than shipped as a second copy
that can go stale.

**Deserialization is STRICT**, likewise: the payload arrives from a browser, so an
unknown key is a refusal rather than a silent drop. A client that misspells
``number_format`` must learn its formatting was not saved, not find out in Excel.
