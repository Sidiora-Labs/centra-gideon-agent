"""Which artifact kinds have an editable document model, and how each crosses the wire.

``GET``/``PUT /api/artifacts/{slug}/model`` need three things per kind — a parser, a
serializer and a strict deserializer — and before this module they were three hard-wired
``docx`` imports in ``artifacts/handlers.py`` beside a hand-kept ``_MODEL_KINDS = ("docx",)``
tuple. Two problems with that: adding a second kind meant branching the route, and the
tuple could name a kind whose parser did not exist (a declared kind with no runtime, which
answers a capability question with a lie).

So the table IS the capability: :data:`MODEL_KINDS` is derived from it, which makes
"advertised" and "implemented" the same fact. A kind is absent until its three functions
exist, and present the moment they do.

The parsers are imported lazily, inside :func:`get_codec`, because they pull in openpyxl /
python-docx and the gateway must not pay for a document library on a route nobody called.
