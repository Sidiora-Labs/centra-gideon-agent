""".pptx bytes → :class:`DeckModel` + a :class:`LossReport`.

The READ half of the deck round trip. Without it a deck could be written but never loaded,
so the editing surface had nothing to edit and ``GET …/model`` answered 415 for every
.pptx — and a bullet's indent depth could not survive a lap, because the writer pinned
``level = 0`` and nothing ever read one back.

**Depth comes from the file's own attribute**, ``a:pPr/@lvl``, which python-pptx exposes as
``paragraph.level``. Never from the text (leading dashes, indent characters): an outline
whose depth was guessed from prose would flatten the one deck that spells its sub-points
without punctuation, and deepen the one that uses a dash as a word.

**Every parse lives beside a loss report, same contract as the docx and xlsx parsers.** A
real deck holds a great deal this model does not — pictures, tables, charts, free text
boxes, per-character formatting, extra placeholders — and the editor re-renders from the
model, so anything not represented here is gone the moment a save lands. It is reported,
never dropped silently, and located in the terms the EDITOR shows ("slide 3 · bullet 2",
"cover slide") rather than the file's shape count, so a person can find what it names.
