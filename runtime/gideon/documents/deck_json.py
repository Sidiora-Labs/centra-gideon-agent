"""JSON⇄:class:`DeckModel` — the ONLY shape a deck crosses the wire in.

The deck half of what ``model_json.py`` does for a text document and ``sheet_json.py`` for
a workbook, and for the same reason: the slide editor edits the *model*, never the bytes,
so the server parses a .pptx into a model, hands the model to the browser, takes a model
back, and re-renders it with the shipped writer. No OOXML is constructed in a browser, and
that is a property of this boundary rather than a convention somebody remembers.

Separate module, not a third pair of functions in one file: the three models share no node
type, so folding them together would produce one file whose every function belonged to a
third of it.

**Serialization is ``asdict``** for ``model_json.py``'s reason — a hand-written mapper is
one forgotten line from dropping a field the writer still emits.

**Deserialization is STRICT**, likewise: the payload arrives from a browser, so an unknown
key is a refusal rather than a silent drop, and a layout the shipped template does not have
is refused HERE rather than becoming a slide that quietly rebuilt itself on save.
