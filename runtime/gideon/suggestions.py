# Fallback suggestions when the LLM is unavailable or context is empty.
#
# 🔴 EVERY ENTRY HERE MUST BE EXECUTABLE ON AN INSTANCE WITH NO DATA, because that is the only
# state this list is ever shown in. ``generate_suggestions`` returns it precisely when
# ``_build_context`` came back empty — no memory, no sessions, no automations — and
# ``SuggestionsCache`` seeds from it before the first generation. So it is the brand-new-install
# list, and it is the first thing a new user reads on the most-visited surface in the product.
#
# Two entries used to ask about state the empty state does not have by construction:
#
#     "Summarize my recent conversations"   there are none — that is WHY we are in the fallback
#     "Review my latest PR"                 assumes a repository context nobody has configured
#
# Both dead-end into "you don't have any", which is a poor first answer and teaches nothing about
# what the product can do. Replaced with one orientation prompt and one that names a real,
# distinctive capability a fresh instance can actually perform.
#
# ``test_suggestions_fallback_needs_no_data.py`` holds the criterion, not the strings — so this
# list can be re-worded freely and only a *dead-end* re-appearing reds the gate.
#
# 🔑 AND EACH ENTRY NAMES SOMETHING THIS PRODUCT DISTINCTIVELY DOES. That is a copy JUDGMENT,
# not a defect, so it is stated here rather than asserted in a test: this list is the product's
# first self-description, on the surface a new user opens most.
#
# Three entries used to be generic text generation — "Generate sunrise haiku", "Give me a
# three-word farewell", "Help me brainstorm an idea". Any chat box can serve those, so half the
# list taught nothing about a self-hosted agentic OS with tools, tasks, automations, knowledge
# and local execution. Every entry now points at a shipped surface:
#
#     Show health-check status               the doctor / system surface
#     Break a goal into tasks                Tasks
#     Save a note to my knowledge base       Knowledge (ingest works on an empty base)
#     Run a command and explain the output   Terminal + tools — the local-execution thesis
#     What can you help me with?             orientation, the one thing a new user always asks
#     Set up a daily briefing                Triggers / automations
#
# Nothing here promises a capability the product lacks — the one hard rule a suggestion list has,
# because a chip that leads to "I can't do that" is worse than a generic one.

    ``generate_suggestions`` decide between the fallback list and a real LLM turn.

    The current time is deliberately NOT part of this. It used to be appended here
    unconditionally, which quietly made that decision depend on the CALENDAR: the guard reads
    ``len(context) < 50``, and a lone time section measures 44-53 characters depending on how long
    today's weekday and month names are. On a brand-new empty install that meant

        "Friday, May 01"        -> 44 chars -> falls back correctly
        "Wednesday, September"  -> 53 chars -> passes the guard and calls the LLM

    which is 113 days of 2026 spent asking a model for suggestions from a context whose entire
    content is a timestamp. Worse, the first ``/api/suggestions`` call AWAITS that generation for
    up to 45s (see ``api_suggestions``), so whether a new user's chat suggestions appeared instantly
    or after most of a minute came down to the length of a weekday name.
