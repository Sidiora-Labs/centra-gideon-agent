"""``browse`` — the autonomous web-interaction action provider (BA-3, plan §8.3/§9).

A standard :class:`~gideon.action_providers.base.ActionProvider`, which is the whole
point: a workflow action node, a schedule trigger, a lifecycle hook and an event trigger all
invoke it by NAME through the seams they already use, so browse inherits the denylist, the
incident kill switch, the rung ladder and the injection screen without any of those seams
learning what a browser is. Plan §9 calls this provider-fidelity wiring; the failure it
avoids is a bespoke "browse runner" beside the dispatch path, governed by nothing.

``action_config``::

    {"goal": "…", "start_url": "https://…",
     "max_steps": 20,              # optional; plan §7.2 default
     "target": "gateway",          # optional; "gateway" (default) | "user_browser"
     "cdp_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/page/…",   # the page target to drive
     "screenshot_dir": "/path"}    # optional; capture-to-PATH, never base64

**Two execution targets, one selector** (BA-7, plan §(a)/§(d)). ``target`` picks WHICH browser:
``gateway`` (the default, and the only behaviour before BA-7) drives the ``cdp_url`` on this
config under the gateway's own profile; ``user_browser`` drives the operator's own browser
through the connector. The vocabulary, the connector and both refusals live in
:mod:`gideon.browse.target` — read its module docstring for why an unconnected
``user_browser`` task SKIPS instead of falling back, and why it can never run unattended.

**Where the guards are.** The budget is checked inside
:func:`~gideon.browse.loop.run_browse_loop`, immediately before each model call, and the
incident kill switch is checked here before a browser is touched. Neither lives in a helper
that only the default path calls: a gate placed one level away from where the work happens is
bypassed by the next caller that supplies its own plumbing, which is exactly how a guard ends
up shipped and inert.

**The credential handoff** (BA-4, plan §5). Three things happen here and nowhere else:

* **§5.3, before a model call is spent.** :func:`~gideon.browse.handoff.session_state` is
  consulted on ``start_url``. A site whose recorded session has gone stale parks IMMEDIATELY, which
  is the whole value of a pre-run check — parking on step 14 wastes thirteen steps the user paid
  for. A site with no profile at all does NOT park unless ``start_url`` is itself a sign-in page:
  "we have never logged in here" is the normal state of every public page on the web, and parking on
  it would make the handoff fire on every run.
* **The park routes through the SHIPPED needs-input gate.** A ``login_required`` park is a park:
  ``_to_result`` already maps every park to ``outcome="needs_input"``, which the engine's
  action-node dispatch maps to WAITING and ``workflows/attention.py`` projects into the inbox.
  BA-4 adds a reason and a card, not a second park/resume.
* **"Authenticated" is OBSERVED, never asserted.** :func:`~gideon.browse.handoff.record_login`
  is called when a run that started without a fresh session COMPLETES — that is plan §5.2's own
  wording for the invariant ("it only knows 'I am now authenticated' by observing that the
  post-login page contains the expected content"). It is also what makes the second run cheap:
  run 1 records the session, run 2 reads ``fresh`` and never asks the human again.

**Browser lifecycle is still NOT here**, and BA-4 does not change that. ``browse/transport.py``
records the decision: core does not discover Chrome, does not own a ``--user-data-dir`` process and
does not supervise one. So the handoff hands the caller the exact argv that binds a headful window
to the site's persistent profile (:func:`~gideon.browse.handoff.chrome_launch_args`) instead
of launching it — which keeps the profile choice unforgeable (a caller cannot accidentally open the
login window against a different profile than the run will read) while leaving the process where it
already lives. Absent a target the provider returns a typed, actionable failure rather than
pretending to browse — an action that silently no-ops is worse than one that says it cannot run.
