"""``browse`` — the autonomous web-interaction action provider (BA-3, plan §8.3/§9).

A standard :class:`~gideon.action_providers.base.ActionProvider`, which is the whole
point: a workflow action node, a schedule trigger, a lifecycle hook and an event trigger all
invoke it by NAME through the seams they already use, so browse inherits the denylist, the
incident kill switch, the rung ladder and the injection screen without any of those seams
learning what a browser is. Plan §9 calls this provider-fidelity wiring; the failure it
avoids is a bespoke "browse runner" beside the dispatch path, governed by nothing.

``action_config``::

    {"goal": "…", "start_url": "https://…",
     "max_steps": 20,              # optional; plan §7.2 default
     "target": "gateway",          # optional; "gateway" (default) | "user_browser"
     "cdp_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/page/…",   # the page target to drive
     "screenshot_dir": "/path"}    # optional; capture-to-PATH, never base64

**Two execution targets, one selector** (BA-7, plan §(a)/§(d)). ``target`` picks WHICH browser:
``gateway`` (the default, and the only behaviour before BA-7) drives the ``cdp_url`` on this
config under the gateway's own profile; ``user_browser`` drives the operator's own browser
through the connector. The vocabulary, the connector and both refusals live in
:mod:`gideon.browse.target` — read its module docstring for why an unconnected
``user_browser`` task SKIPS instead of falling back, and why it can never run unattended.

**Where the guards are.** The budget is checked inside
:func:`~gideon.browse.loop.run_browse_loop`, immediately before each model call, and the
incident kill switch is checked here before a browser is touched. Neither lives in a helper
that only the default path calls: a gate placed one level away from where the work happens is
bypassed by the next caller that supplies its own plumbing, which is exactly how a guard ends
up shipped and inert.

**Browser lifecycle is NOT here.** The provider drives a CDP page target it is given
(``cdp_url``); launching Chrome with a persistent per-site profile is BA-4's credential-handoff
slice. Absent a target the provider returns a typed, actionable failure rather than pretending
to browse — an action that silently no-ops is worse than one that says it cannot run.
