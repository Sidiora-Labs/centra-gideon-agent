"""``knowledge-health`` and ``knowledge-consolidate`` — the store's maintenance actions.

Two providers, split by COST rather than by topic, because that split is what makes a
maintenance cadence affordable:

**`knowledge-health`** is zero-token and deterministic. Stubs, orphans, broken internal
citations, items missing from the search index, past-expiry probes. Cheap enough to run on
every write, which is the only cadence that catches a problem before something builds on it.

**`knowledge-consolidate`** plans and applies the clustering pass. It is expensive, so it is
gated (min-hours, min-new-material, contention) and it defaults to a DRY RUN: the plan is the
artifact, and applying it is a separate explicit act.

Both report rather than enforce. A health finding is a fact about the store, not a verdict on
it — an orphan may be the only record of something, and a template that auto-deleted orphans
would destroy exactly the knowledge nobody happened to link.

    🔴 **Dry run. This does NOT apply.** `_apply` writes a model-authored summary and then

    Applying also needs one model call per cluster, so an unattended tick would spend unbounded
