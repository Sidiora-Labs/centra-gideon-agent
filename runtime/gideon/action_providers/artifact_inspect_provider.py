"""``artifact_inspect`` action provider — pull an offloaded node output on demand (WV-11).

The other half of output-offloading. When a node's output crosses `MAX_INLINE_OUTPUT_BYTES`
(or is binary), the journal writes the full body to `runs/<id>/artifacts/` and leaves a
head+tail stub inline; `{{nodes.x.artifact}}` then resolves to that artifact's ref. Bindings
carry the POINTER cheaply so a 5MB report never rides in a prompt or an SSE frame — but a
downstream node sometimes genuinely needs the body (a summarizer over a large fetch, a diff
against a big prior result). This provider is how it asks, as a zero-token action:

    {"provider": "artifact_inspect", "with": {"ref": "{{nodes.fetch.artifact}}"}}

It returns the artifact CONTENT, optionally a byte slice (`offset`/`length`) so a caller can
page through a huge body without loading all of it. The ref is confined to the run's own
`artifacts/` directory: it arrives from a template a model may have authored, so a `../`
escape, an absolute path, or a pointer into `outputs/` is refused rather than trusted —
`store.read_artifact` does the confinement and this provider never reads outside it.
