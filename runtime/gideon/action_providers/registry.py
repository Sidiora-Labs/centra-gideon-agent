    """Idempotent registration of the built-in providers.

    Called from `gideon.hooks` on first action execution so the providers
    are available even if no startup hook has registered them yet (tests,
    CLI invocations). These are intrinsic actions (not optional add-ons) — the
    script-hooks / triggers runtime resolves them by name (``bash`` is the default
    hook backend, ``run-script`` the deterministic script action) — so they register
    unconditionally and stay core-native.

    ``webhook`` (a self-contained HTTP-POST adapter that NO core runtime depends on)
    moved to a standalone app (apps/webhook-action) and registers via the app loader
    when installed. The four native actions (notify / send-message / create-task /
    invoke-agent) reach in-process services via the action service accessor.

    Registering a provider also registers its AUTONOMY DECLARATION (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS
    §5.2): the two paths must not be able to drift, because a provider present in the
    dispatch registry with no declaration behind it is exactly the case the dispatch seams
    cannot tell apart from an ungoverned action. ``guardrails.rungs.CORE_ACTION_TYPES`` is
    the table; ``test_guardrails_rung_routing`` asserts every built-in name here appears in
    it, so adding a provider without a declaration reds the build.
