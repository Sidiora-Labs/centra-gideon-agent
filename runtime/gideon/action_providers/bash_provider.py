# The child environment is built by ALLOWLIST — `sandbox.build_child_env` — so a hook
# command like `env` or `printenv` cannot read the gateway's credentials at all. This
# replaced a name-pattern denylist (PHF-4): the denylist kept everything it did not
# recognise, which on a real gateway meant ~121 inherited variables minus the shapes the
# pattern happened to know, and it could never see a credential named in a shape nobody
# had thought of. The allowlist inverts the default.

_ENV_NAME = re.compile(r"^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$")


#: Env vars a PAYLOAD KEY may never set (§7/R4 rule e — S129).
#:
#: 🔴 MEASURED. `_payload_env` merges AFTER the inherited environment (before PHF-4:
#: `os.environ`; now the allowlisted base `sandbox.build_child_env` produces — the merge
#: ORDER, and so this hazard, is unchanged), so a payload key shadows the real variable.
#: Driven end to end: a payload of ``{"PATH": "<dir with a fake `date`>"}``
#: made the command ``date`` print ``HIJACKED``. The whole point of passing the payload as
#: ENV rather than string-templating the command is that a payload value cannot become
#: code — but a payload *key* could change which binary the code resolves to, which is the
#: same outcome by a different route.
#:
#: These are the variables that decide WHAT RUNS or WHERE IT LOOKS: the loader hijacks
#: (`LD_PRELOAD`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`), the resolution paths (`PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`),
#: the interpreter's own entry points (`BASH_ENV`, `PYTHONSTARTUP`), and the home/config
#: roots the harness itself reads back (`GIDEON_HOME`). A payload naming any of them
#: is either a mistake or an attack, and neither should win over the process environment.
#:
#: A DENYLIST rather than an allowlist here, deliberately and unlike S126's payload keys:
#: `$variables` are the trigger's documented user-facing surface (`$now`, `$job_id`,
#: `$last_result`, plus every key a kind's payload carries), so an allowlist would have to
#: enumerate them all and would silently drop a new kind's variables. The dangerous set,
#: by contrast, is small, well-known and stable.
