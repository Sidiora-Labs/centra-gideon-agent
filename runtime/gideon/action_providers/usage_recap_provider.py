"""The monthly usage-recap action (MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY MRT-3).

Renders `routing.usage.usage_recap(month)` for the calendar month that just closed and hands it
to `DashboardState.notify()` — so the recap inherits the rules engine wholesale: the global gate
(mute-all / min-severity / quiet hours) runs first, then the per-`(source, kind)` rule, whose
registered default for `system/usage_recap` is `digest`.

**Deterministic, no model call.** Same reasoning as `digest_provider`: the recap is a template
render over a fold of things that already happened, and the one thing a money surface must never
do is invent a figure. `usage_recap` is a pure function of the fold.

**Exactly one delivery per month.** The cron fires monthly, but a monthly cron firing twice is a
real event, not a hypothetical: the boot sweep re-arms an overdue trigger (so a machine asleep
across the 1st fires on wake), `reconcile_usage_recap_cron` re-arms on a schedule change, and a
user can fire a trigger by hand. So the month is the idempotency key, recorded in
`usage_recap_sent.json` and checked BEFORE rendering. Without it the recap would be "one
notification per boot in the first week of the month".

The mark is written whether or not the notification survived the gate. A recap suppressed by the
user's own quiet hours is suppressed, not deferred — retrying until it lands is exactly the
escalation a quiet-hours setting exists to refuse, and a month-old spend summary has no urgency
to justify it. `delivered` records which happened, so the state is legible rather than merely
absent.
