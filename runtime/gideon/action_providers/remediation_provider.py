"""The remediation engine as ONE adaptive-clock trigger (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §4.3/§4.4 — PR2-8).

**What this replaces.** The engine used to hang off the heartbeat as
`HeartbeatService._maybe_remediate`, carrying its own private scheduler in a
`_remediation_next_ts` float and its own private ownership protocol (a bool return that decided
whether `_legacy_maintenance` ran that tick). §4.3 always said that form was provisional: *"Once
AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE lands, the engine IS one trigger (adaptive clock kind, `created_by: system`)
on the Automations page … Before that, it hangs off the heartbeat loop as one job."* The substrate
has landed, so the heartbeat job is DELETED and this is the engine's only driver — one mechanism,
not two.

**What re-homing actually buys.** Nothing here re-implements scheduling, capability fencing,
ledgering or delivery: the trigger tick arms the clock, `triggers/screen.py` freezes the grant,
`_record_fire_outcome` writes the run record, and `_deliver_fire_outcome` → `state.notify` →
`notification_rules` routes the outcome. That last one is §4.4's second clause — *"the runs-inbox
'learned overnight' digest picks them up like any other run"* — and it is satisfied by NOT having a
private notification path: a remediation run reaches the digest queue through exactly the code that
carries every other automation's run, so a user whose rule for that kind is `digest` gets it in the
grouped item without anything here knowing the digest exists.

**The adaptive half.** `triggers/arm.cadence_next_fire` picks between two declared cadences using
`spec.health_state`, and stays pure. This provider is the ONE writer of that state, and it re-arms
after the run rather than letting the tick's pre-fire arm stand: the tick arms BEFORE dispatch (§3.1
crash safety), so it can only ever see the PREVIOUS run's state, and a degradation that had to wait
a full healthy sleep before shortening the tick would defeat the cadence entirely.
