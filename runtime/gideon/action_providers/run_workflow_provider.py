"""``run-workflow`` action provider — start a v2 workflow run from a trigger.

Deleted with the old workflow feature (WORKFLOWS-V2 Phase 1) and re-registered here
against the v2 engine. It is re-added to ``ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`` **in the same
commit**: a provider registered in one set but not the other is exactly the mismatch
that lets a trigger validate, save, and then fail at fire time with nothing actionable.

``action_config`` shape::

    {
        "workflow": "triage-inbox",     # required: a saved def name
        "inputs": {"since": "1h"},      # optional: run inputs
        "mode": "background",           # background (default) | blocking
        "project_id": "...",            # optional project binding
        "idempotency_key": "..."        # optional caller dedupe key
    }

**`outcome: "launched"`, not success.** A background run has only STARTED when this
returns; its real outcome lands in the run's own ledger. Reporting it as plain success
would make an unverified run look verified — the honesty contract `ActionResult.outcome`
exists for.

**`on_overlap` is honoured here**, not left to the caller. A per-minute trigger against
a ten-minute workflow must not stack runs, and the def's declared policy (`skip` by
default) is the single place that decision belongs.
