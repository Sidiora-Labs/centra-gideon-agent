"""``check-work`` action provider — the engine-native half of HARNESS-CRAFT §3.2 (HC-5).

A thin spec wrapper over :func:`gideon.check_work.derive_and_run` — the §3.1 core
the bundled ``check-work`` skill and the SDLC post-gate hook already share — so any v2
workflow can end with a verification node that runs the SAME reconstruct → derive →
execute pass, and the three entry points cannot drift.

Doctrine carried over unchanged (ground truth over self-report): every derived check
either executes against the filesystem or is reported ``unverifiable`` — never assumed
passing. The core never shells out on its own authority and this provider injects no
``command_runner``, so a claim naming a command is reported ``unverifiable`` ("re-run it
yourself") rather than optimistically passed. Filesystem checks are bounded reads
confined under the given root (`check_work._resolve` refuses an escape).

``action_config`` shape::

    {
        "text": "the claims to verify",   # required — a stage's findings, a summary
        "root": "/where/the/work/landed", # optional; defaults to the run's workspace
        "max_checks": 4                   # optional; the core's 2-4 ceiling
    }

Output: ``{verdict, note, checks, report}`` — ``checks`` carries one
``{kind, target, needle, claim, label, how, status, evidence}`` per derived check and
``report`` is the same markdown ``render_report`` gives the skill. Verdict mapping
follows the SDLC hook's precedent exactly (``ok = verdict != "fail"``): only a check
that RAN and contradicted its claim fails the node; ``unverifiable`` and underivable
never manufacture a failure — the node adds ground truth, it does not invent doubt.
