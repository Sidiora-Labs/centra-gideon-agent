"""``selfqa-evidence`` action provider — seal the proof bundle, deterministically (SV-10 §3.3).

The plan's evidence node was an LLM ``stage`` told to "compute the digests; do not estimate them"
— an instruction a model can quietly ignore. This provider replaces that trust with code: it
derives the contact-sheet and GIF from the recording (ffmpeg as a local subprocess, degrading
typed when ffmpeg is absent), computes the SHA256 manifest from the bytes on disk, registers the
bundle as a **single** Artifact, and runs the required-kinds completion gate — and it opens the
optional fix branch on a confirmed failure. Everything a self-report could get wrong is measured
instead.

The node reads its bundle from the **run workspace** — the same directory the ``execute`` stage
wrote ``screenshots/`` and ``recording.mp4`` into. The engine threads that path into the action
payload as ``workspace`` (the artifact gate at the same dispatch seam already receives it), so the
provider needs no coupling to the run store to find the files.

Output (one JSON object, so the template binds ``{{nodes.evidence.output.*}}``)::

    {
        "evidence_ref": "artifact:<slug>",   # the single Artifact
        "complete": true|false,               # the required-kinds gate
        "present": ["screenshot", …],
        "missing": ["recording", …],          # the gate's missing-kinds list (Criterion #7)
        "degraded": [{"kind": "gif", "reason": "…"}],
        "fix_branch": "pclaw/selfqa-<sha8>"    # "" unless a failure + fix_branch_enabled
    }

A missing required kind returns ``success=False`` with the missing list, which marks the node —
and so the run — incomplete: a run cannot pass while its declared proof is absent, independent of
what the driving agent claimed. §5's "no new provider TYPE" holds — this is an action provider
added to ``ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`` exactly as §5 requires for one, the QA run still fires through
``run-workflow``, and no new inbox source or task provider is introduced.
