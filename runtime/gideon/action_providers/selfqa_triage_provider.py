"""``selfqa-triage`` action provider — step zero of the Self-QA loop, at zero tokens.

Classifies each new commit's user-visible impact and writes one ledger record per commit, then
hands the impactful ones forward as structured output the template branches on.

**Why an action node rather than the `infer` node the plan sketched.** Two properties the plan's
own §3.2 asks for are only obtainable from code. The skip must be *recorded with its rationale*,
and only a node with the run id can write the run ledger — an `infer` node returns text, and the
engine's own `step_skipped` row carries no reason (`journal.step_skipped` takes no rationale), so
a model-authored triage leaves the "why did nothing run?" question unanswered in the one place
the plan says it must be answered. And the classification must be *assertable*: a test-only
commit skipped for the right reason and a companion that never fired both produce zero findings,
so a prompt whose only checkable property is "some string came back" cannot tell them apart.

Triage is also the wrong place to spend a model call. Judging "could a user notice this?" from
changed paths is a decision a `frozenset` makes correctly and for free, on every commit, forever.
The judgment the loop genuinely needs — *what scenario would catch this* — stays in the
template's `scenario-gen` stage, where it belongs.

``action_config`` shape::

    {
        "repo": "/path/to/repo",     # required
        "commits": ["sha", …],        # required
        "max_scenarios": 3            # optional; defaults to agent.self_qa.max_scenarios_per_fire
    }

Output (one JSON object, so the template can bind ``{{nodes.triage.output.*}}``)::

    {
        "verdicts":   [{sha, impact, rationale, subject, paths}],
        "impactful":  [{…}],          # capped at max_scenarios
        "skipped":    [{…}],
        "has_impactful": true|false,  # what the branch reads
        "recorded": 4                 # ledger rows written
