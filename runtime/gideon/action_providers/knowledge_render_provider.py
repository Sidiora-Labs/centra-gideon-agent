"""``render-report`` — a declarative report spec into a sanitized, self-contained export.

KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §6.2 (KNOW-R15), the optional terminal step of a synthesis or monitoring
template. Zero tokens: the spec is authored once (by a human or by one earlier `stage`), and every
later run re-renders it against fresh data. That is the whole reason the spec and the data are
separate arguments — a periodic synthesizer regenerates the visuals for free, with no model call.

**What is stored where.** The SPEC TEXT is the versioned record: it lands in the artifacts registry
(`artifacts/registry.py`), which is where versioning lives — knowledge items have no version
history. The rendered HTML is a DERIVED export written to a companion artifact whose body is
replaced, not accumulated, because a regenerated view is not a new authored revision. Each export
records the spec version it was rendered from, so a stale export is identifiable rather than merely
old.

**Sanitization is the point.** A spec's strings are usually LLM output over untrusted web or inbox
material, and the export is served same-origin with the dashboard. `knowledge/reports.py` admits no
caller markup at all and refuses to emit a document containing script, an event handler, or a remote
reference; this provider adds nothing to that and bypasses none of it.
