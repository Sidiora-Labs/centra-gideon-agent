"""The morning source digest's CALLER (WATCHED-SOURCES §6.2, WS-7's missing half).

WS-7 shipped `knowledge/source_digest.py:run_morning_digest` fully tested and **with zero
callers** — its own execution log records the atom as PARTIAL for exactly that reason: *"the
digest is invocable and fully tested, but nothing in the shipped product calls it yet"*. This
module is that caller: an action provider the scheduler can dispatch, plus the reconciliation
that makes a bundled `clock` trigger point at it.

**A clock trigger, NOT a bundled workflow template.** WS-7 chose a callable over a template
because *"inventing a template format for one consumer would have put `fence_untrusted` inside a
user-editable prompt string — a security control a template author could delete."* That
reasoning is intact here: the prompt is still composed in `source_digest.build_prompt`, the
trigger's `workflow.inline.config` is EMPTY, and there is no prompt text anywhere on this path
for a user to edit. The trigger carries a schedule and a provider name and nothing else.

**Why an action provider rather than calling the digest from the tick.** `reconcile_digest_cron`
(`digest_provider.py`) is the codebase's shape for "a bundled thing that arranges to run on a
clock": a deterministic-id `Trigger` row in the unified store whose `workflow.inline.provider`
names a registered action provider. Riding it means the digest inherits the whole fire path —
disposition, the overlap claim lock, history, `delivery: none` — instead of a second scheduling
mechanism beside it. It also means the digest is dispatchable by hand from the Triggers UI, which
is the "user can find it and use it" half of user-reachability.

**It writes `crons.json` NEVER.** `reconcile_digest_cron`'s docstring records S108: the boot
migration that imports `crons.json` runs BEFORE reconciliation, so a row written there stays
inert until the next boot. This writes the unified `TriggerStore` directly.

**Creation-only convergence, and NO new config field.** "Morning" is the meaning of the feature,
not a preference — the same call `reconcile_usage_recap_cron` makes for "monthly". So an existing
row is left exactly as the user left it, including a schedule they edited by hand, and no
`config.json` field is minted to converge. (`notification-digest` converges because ITS schedule
is a documented Settings control; this one has none.)

**Exactly one item and one notification per run, and nothing posts twice (SC#10).** Two distinct
guarantees, neither invented here:

1. *Within* a run, `run_morning_digest` writes ONE `note` item and calls `state.notify` once.
2. *Across* fires, `<home>/sources/digest_cursor.json` is the guard. The cursor advances past the
   window only after the item is durable, so a second sequential fire (a retry, a restart, a
   hand-run right after the cron) reads an EMPTY window and returns `skipped_reason` — zero
   items, zero notifications, zero model calls. Concurrent fires are refused one level up by the
   overlap claim lock (`triggers/firepath.py` step 7; `Trigger.overlap` defaults to `"skip"`).
   The failure the cursor deliberately does NOT prevent is a crash BETWEEN the item write and the
   cursor write, which re-reads the window and produces a second visible digest — WS-7's stated
   trade, because the reverse ordering loses a day's items silently.

**The notification gate is not re-implemented or bypassed.** The provider hands
`DashboardState` straight to the digest; delivery is `state.notify` →
`notification_allowed()` exactly as WS-7 shipped it, so `mute_all` / minimum severity / quiet
hours still suppress. Nothing here notifies on its own, which is why `delivery: none` on the
trigger costs nothing: the digest's own notification IS the user-visible output.
