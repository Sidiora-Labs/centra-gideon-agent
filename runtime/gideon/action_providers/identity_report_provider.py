"""The periodic identity report as ONE clock trigger (LEARNING-VISIBILITY T2.5 — LV-4).

**What this closes.** `learning_report.py` shipped the whole composition and delivery half —
`compose_identity_report`, the narrative pass, the versioned artifact, the notify-gated inbox
item — plus a `POST /api/learning/identity-report` a user could reach by hand. Nothing
scheduled it. So the plan's "scheduled (default monthly, configurable) background job" existed
as a function with one caller, which is the shape this codebase calls a delivery path nothing
drives.

**Nothing here re-implements scheduling.** The trigger tick arms the clock,
`triggers/screen.py` freezes the grant, `guardrails/rungs.py` classifies the action,
`_record_fire_outcome` writes the run record and `_deliver_fire_outcome` routes the outcome.
This module owns exactly two things a scheduler cannot know: which cron expression each cadence
means, and that `off` means do not run.

**`off` is refused on the PRODUCING side, not just the arming side.** The reconciler disables
the row, AND `execute` returns before composing anything. Both, because they answer different
questions: a disabled row does not fire, but a user can re-enable one by hand on the Triggers
page, and a fire that produced a report against an explicit `off` would be the config lying.
This is `remediation_provider`'s doubled defence and it is stated there for the same reason —
a cadence that computes a next-fire time and then discards the output is an inert control, and
computing the schedule is not the part that matters.

**One delivery function, two callers.** The cron and the POST route both call
`deliver_identity_report`, so the hand-run and the scheduled run cannot diverge — and the
period-keyed `delivery_dedup_key` means a hand-run followed by a scheduled one inside the same
period reuses the row instead of pinging twice.
