"""The notification-digest action (INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION T5.1).

Drains `digest_queue.jsonl` into one grouped inbox item. Registered as a system cron so the
schedule is user-configurable through the same rules store as the modes that feed it.

**Deterministic, no model call.** A digest is a grouping of things that already happened, so
an LLM would add latency, cost, and a chance of inventing detail — for a summary whose whole
value is that it's accurate. It runs on the action-provider path (like `bash`/`notify`),
never the agent path.
