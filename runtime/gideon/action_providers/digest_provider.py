"""The notification-digest action (INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION T5.1).

Drains `digest_queue.jsonl` into one grouped inbox item. Registered as a system cron so the
schedule is user-configurable through the same rules store as the modes that feed it.

**Deterministic, no model call.** A digest is a grouping of things that already happened, so
an LLM would add latency, cost, and a chance of inventing detail — for a summary whose whole
value is that it's accurate. It runs on the action-provider path (like `bash`/`notify`),
never the agent path.

    Converges the schedule rather than only creating the trigger: the schedule lives in the rules
    store, so a user who edits it in Settings must not have to know that a cron exists
    somewhere to be re-registered. Best-effort — a scheduler problem must never block startup.

    **🔴 S108 — this wrote `crons.json`, so the digest DID NOT RUN.** The clock engine reads the
    unified store only, and the boot migration that imports `crons.json` ran BEFORE this
    reconciliation — so the digest trigger this function registered was inert until the NEXT boot
    imported it, and a schedule edited in Settings took two restarts to take effect. Writes the
    store directly now.

    The row is built as a `Trigger` rather than through `tools.create` for the reason `app_crons`
    records: convergence needs a DETERMINISTIC id, and `tools.create` mints its own unique slug, so
    every restart would add another digest instead of recognizing its own.
