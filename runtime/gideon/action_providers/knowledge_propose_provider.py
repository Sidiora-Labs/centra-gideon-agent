"""``knowledge-propose`` — file a knowledge draft into the human review queue.

The write half of the maintenance tier is `knowledge-persist`; this is the PROPOSE half.
A gap-healing draft or a `schema.md` convention edit (KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §3.3/§3.4) goes
through `learning.proposals.enqueue` under `Kind.KNOWLEDGE_DRAFT` and waits for a human,
because the alternative was measured and is worse: a drafted entry nobody reviewed becomes
a citable source for the next draft, and two generations later the store cites itself as
evidence.

Before this provider existed, NOTHING reachable from a workflow could reach the proposal
queue at all — `enqueue`'s only callers were Python-side, so a template that wanted to
propose had exactly one option available to it: write. That is why gap-healing shipped
persisting a TTL'd probe tagged `proposal` into the knowledge store. It looked like a
proposal in the store and reached no review gate, and the probe expired 30 days later
whether or not anyone had ever seen it.

**A SKIP is a SUCCESS.** `enqueue` returns `Verdict.SKIP` when a prior decision forbids
re-filing (already accepted, still cooling down after a rejection) or when an inferred
draft is below the evidence floor. Its docstring is explicit that the caller must treat
that as success — *not nagging is the feature*. A provider that failed the node on SKIP
would make a healthy cadence look broken every single time it correctly said nothing, and
the fix a user would reach for is turning the template off.
