"""``artifact-update`` action provider — refresh a live artifact from a workflow (WF2-R15).

The pattern this exists for: a dashboard-style template generates an HTML (or markdown) skeleton
ONCE, then refreshes it on every run by re-binding `{{nodes.x.output}}` slots through a pure
transform. Without this provider the only way to update the artifact would be a `stage` — a whole
subagent session spawned to paste text into a file, which costs a model call and a lane slot for
work that is pure substitution.

So this is a **zero-token** node. It takes content the engine already resolved and writes it.

Three decisions worth stating:

**Upsert, not create-or-fail.** A recurring workflow's first run has no artifact and its
hundredth does. Making the template branch on that would put a `branch` node in every dashboard
spec for a distinction the provider can just absorb — so an unknown slug is created and a known
one is updated.

**`snapshot` is opt-in.** A dashboard refreshed every five minutes would otherwise accumulate a
version per refresh and bury the versions a human actually cares about. A template that wants
history asks for it.

**The slug is validated, not trusted.** It reaches here from a template's config, which a model
may have authored, and it becomes a directory name in the artifact store. The store's own writer
guards traversal too, but failing here gives the author the error at the node that named it.
