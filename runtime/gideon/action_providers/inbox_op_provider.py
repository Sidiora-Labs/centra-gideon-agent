"""``inbox-op`` action provider — the triage tier's hands (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §1.6).

Five operations against the inbox a triage proposal can bind arguments to: ``archive``,
``mark_read``, ``mute_thread``, ``dismiss`` and ``reply_draft``. Registered like every other
native action, so once it exists it is usable by ALL trigger kinds, not only by triage.

**Every operation is reversible, and that is the reason this provider exists at all.** §1.6
makes reversibility the definition of the trivial-capable class: an action the user can take
back in one click is one the machine may perform unattended. So each execution returns an
opaque ``reversal`` handle carrying the PRIOR state, and :meth:`reverse` restores it. A handle
is base64 rather than a colon-joined string because two of the three things it has to carry —
an item id (``{channel}_{ts}``, and a channel name may contain anything) and a previous draft
(free text) — cannot be delimited by any character reserved in the handle grammar.

**``reply_draft`` writes a DRAFT and never sends.** That is §1.6 bound 2 expressed in the
provider rather than trusted to the caller: even a user's own always-approve rule for
``reply_draft`` reaches this code, and this code has no send path. Graduating a pattern to an
actual send is a separate per-rule toggle over a send-capable provider, and it is deliberately
not reachable from here.

**Writes go through :func:`gideon.inbox.live_store`.** The running service holds items in
MEMORY and never re-reads the file, so a provider that constructed its own ``InboxStore()``
would write a row the API cannot see and that the service's next save silently overwrites. A
missing live store is reported as a failure, not worked around.

``action_config`` shape::

    {"op": "archive", "item_id": "C123_1712000000.5", "draft": "…"}

``op`` also accepts the proposal vocabulary spelling under the key ``action_type``, so a
:class:`~gideon.proactive.proposals.Proposal` binds without a translation layer.
