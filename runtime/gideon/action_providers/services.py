"""Service accessor for native action providers.

bash/webhook/run-script actions are self-contained, but the native action
providers (notify / send-message / create-task / invoke-agent) must reach
in-process services — DashboardState (notifications / channel send), the tasks
registry, the SubagentManager — without importing the dashboard package
(layering) and without each provider re-discovering globals.

Mirrors ``gideon.hooks.set_global_hook_store`` / ``get_global_hook_store``:
the dashboard wires a :class:`ActionServices` at startup; providers fetch it
lazily and return an error result (never raise) if it is unset, so a misordered
startup fails loudly in tests rather than silently no-opping.
