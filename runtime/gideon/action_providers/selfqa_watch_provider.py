"""``selfqa-commit-watch`` action provider — the vcs trigger's action (SV-11).

Fired by the ``system:selfqa-commit-watch`` ``file``-kind trigger (the AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE
``vcs`` preset watching the configured repo's ``.git/refs/heads/*``). It resolves the commit
delta through :mod:`gideon.selfqa.watch` and starts the ``self-qa`` run by delegating
to the registered ``run-workflow`` provider — the one place that already owns caller dedupe
(``START_DEDUPE``), origin stamping, and supervisor registration. Re-implementing the start
here would be a second writer on that seam.

A quiet fire (no new commits, first sight, unreadable repo) is a SUCCESS carrying its
reason — the two-weight discipline: "skipped for the right reason" and "never ran" must
never look alike.
