"""``net-fetch`` — the dispatchable HTTP-egress action provider (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE, WF2KNO-9).

One bounded, guarded, fenced HTTP **GET**, reachable by NAME from every seam that already
dispatches an action: a workflow action node (``workflows.engine.dispatch_action``), a schedule or
event trigger, and a lifecycle hook. That is the whole atom. Before it, ``net.fetch`` was a
*library* function with library callers only — ``web_poll``, the knowledge connectors, the HF token
cascade — so a workflow template that wanted to read a page had no node to put in its spec, and
``WF2KNO-9``'s four monitor/ingest templates (market-monitor, trending-repo-digest, the dual-sink
watcher, paper-ingest) were blocked on a provider nobody owned.

``action_config``::

    {"url": "https://…",
     "max_chars": 20000}          # optional; clamped into [1, MAX_TEXT_CHARS], never above

Returns JSON on ``ActionResult.stdout``::

    {"url": …, "status": 200, "content_type": …,
     "chars": 1234, "truncated": false, "bytes_truncated": false,
     "text": "<untrusted_content …>…</untrusted_content>"}

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE SECURITY POSTURE. Everything else here is plumbing.

**1. It goes THROUGH the chokepoint, not around it.** Every byte is pulled by
:func:`gideon.net.client.fetch`, which is where host classification, the private/link-local
denial, the pinned-IP dial (closing the DNS-rebind TOCTOU window), the per-hop redirect
re-evaluation, the byte cap and the SEL audit all already live. This module opens no socket and
hand-rolls no check. A provider that called ``aiohttp`` directly would inherit none of it —
which is the obligation ``web/render.py`` and ``inbound/capture_proxy.py`` spell out for the
two surfaces that genuinely cannot use ``net.fetch`` (a browser owns its own resolver; an SSE
stream cannot be buffer-capped). This one has no such excuse, so it has no such exemption.

**2. Deny-by-default.** The policy is :func:`gideon.net.policy.fetch_action_egress_policy`,
derived from ``FETCH_ACTION`` — ``allow_only=True`` over an EMPTY host list. An unconfigured
instance therefore reaches **nowhere**, and every refusal is visible rather than silent. Read that
profile's comment for why the reachable set is the operator's existing
``security.egress.allow_hosts`` rather than a new field beside it, and why an additive
``STRICT``-based policy would have made the allow-list decorative.

**3. A blocked host is refused before the request goes out, and the refusal lands in the SEL.**
``net.fetch`` evaluates, writes the ``egress_fetch``/``denied`` audit row, and only then raises —
no session is constructed and no packet leaves. The row's ``caller`` is ``net.fetch:fetch_action``,
so a refusal from this provider is attributable in the log without reading the URL.

**4. The response is attacker-controlled text, so it is bounded then fenced — in that order.**
Bounded twice, because the two bounds stop different things: the policy's ``max_bytes`` stops a
hostile endpoint streaming megabytes into memory, and :data:`MAX_TEXT_CHARS` stops a *legitimate*
2 MB page becoming a denial-of-wallet on the next model call. Truncation happens BEFORE
:func:`gideon.security.fence_untrusted`, never after: fencing appends a close marker, so
truncating a fenced string would cut that marker off and hand the next reader an unclosed fence —
the exact break the fence exists to prevent.

**5. Credentials are out of scope, so they are refused rather than handled.** A URL carrying
userinfo (``https://user:token@host/``) is refused at the boundary: injecting auth into the request
is explicitly not this provider's job, and accepting the shape would mean carrying a secret through
a code path whose whole output is destined for a model context. The URL is additionally screened
once, at that same boundary, through :func:`gideon.security.redact_url_userinfo`, and the
screened value is what every later composition uses — the error sentence, the JSON payload, the
fence's ``source_id``. Screening once and early is the contract: ``redact_credentials`` is NOT
idempotent over a composed ``field: value`` line, so redacting after composition garbles the field
name. The shape-based sweep is deliberately NOT run over a URL — its base64 pass would rewrite
ordinary path segments into ``[REDACTED: encoded credential]`` and leave the user reading a refusal
about a URL they cannot recognise.

**6. Response HEADERS are not returned.** Only ``Content-Type``, and only so a template can tell
that it pointed at a PNG. Handing back the full header dict would put a third party's
``Set-Cookie`` into a workflow binding and, from there, into a prompt.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, so nobody mistakes the list above for the whole of egress:

* **No POST/PUT/DELETE.** Outbound writes belong to ``webhook``, which is POST-only and lives in
  ``apps/webhook-action``. A verb that changes state on somebody else's machine is a different
  governed action with a different consent story, not a parameter on this one.
* **No run-tier narrowing.** ``SafetyProfile.egress_tier`` is not consulted, matching the nearest
  egress precedent (``browse/cdp.py``'s ``_layered_policy`` is ``egress_policy_for(BROWSE)`` and no
  more). It is NOT simply forgotten: ``egress_policy_for_profile`` UNIONs a tier's preset hosts onto
  the base, which narrows an additive base like ``SOURCE`` (``triggers/web_poll.py`` uses it
  correctly for exactly that reason) but can only WIDEN an already-exclusive one — a ``registry``
  tier would add 22 package-registry hosts to this provider's reach. Honouring only the ``off`` tier
  would be coherent, but it needs a session key this provider is not handed, so it is left to the
  atom that adds one rather than half-built here.
* **No content-type allow-list.** A template may legitimately fetch HTML, JSON, XML, CSV or plain
  text; enumerating that reliably is a mime-type war, and the bound plus the fence already contain
  the damage a surprising body can do. ``content_type`` is reported so a template can decide.
