"""``knowledge-persist`` action provider — write to the knowledge store from a workflow.

A synthesis workflow's whole point is to leave something behind. Without this provider the
only way to do that is a `stage` — a subagent session spawned to call a tool that writes a
row — which costs a model call and a lane slot for work the engine has already resolved.

So this is a **zero-token** node, and it is where session 34's semantics become behaviour:

**Idempotent by construction.** The logical key and content hash are derived from what is
being written, so a retried, resumed or rewound persist recomputes the same identity and
becomes a no-op returning the existing id. None of those three paths needs to know the
others exist — which is what makes a nightly synthesis loop safe to re-run.

**A budget overrun is a RETURNED failure, not an exception.** The engine's retry semantics
can act on `{success: false, error: "over budget by N — condense and retry"}`; an exception
just kills the node and loses the work. Same for a missing citation on a synthesized kind.

**Duplicate content reinforces.** Re-persisting the same claim appends a mention and
re-aggregates confidence rather than inserting a second article, so corroboration
strengthens what is stored instead of cluttering it.

**Enrichment is fire-and-forget.** The row is written synchronously; embedding and entity
extraction ride the existing ingest queue. A synthesis stage should not wait on an embedder
that may not even be configured.
