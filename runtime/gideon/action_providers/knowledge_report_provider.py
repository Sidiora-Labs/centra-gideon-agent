"""The scheduled-research-report runner (WF2KNO-12).

One fire of this provider is one report run: resolve the report's source scope, write ONE
finding about what arrived, and stamp the report so the next run starts where this one
stopped. The report definition itself (schedule, scope, policy, watermark) lives in
`gideon.knowledge.research_reports`; this module only RUNS one.

Three decisions in here are load-bearing enough to state up front, because each one has an
obvious-looking alternative that is silently wrong:

**The watermark is taken at SCOPE-RESOLUTION time, never at completion time.** The run reads
`resolution_ts = time.time()` immediately before it asks the store what is new, and stamps
exactly that value on success. Stamping "now" at the END instead would cover the whole window
the model spent writing: any item captured while the model was mid-sentence would fall before
the new watermark without ever having been in a scope, and would therefore be skipped
*forever*. Nothing would error, no item would be missing from the store, and the report would
simply never mention it — which is why this is a comment and a test rather than a convention.

**A report never reads its own output.** Items of `research_reports.FINDING_KIND` are excluded
from every scope. A report writes a finding, the finding is a knowledge item, and a knowledge
item newer than the watermark is in the next scope — so without the exclusion the second run
summarizes the first run's summary and the report degenerates into infinite regress with a
model bill attached.

**An empty scope is a terminal SUCCESS, not a no-op failure and not a skipped run.** Nothing
new arrived is the normal, common outcome of a frequent schedule. It spends zero tokens, writes
no item, and still advances the watermark — because the window really was examined.
