"""``knowledge-retrieve`` action provider — query the knowledge store from a workflow.

The paired half of `knowledge-persist`, and the reason both exist as ACTIONS rather than
tools: a three-node retrieve → synthesize → persist pattern spends exactly one model call,
on the synthesis. Doing the retrieve through a `stage` would spend a second one on a query.

Two things this returns that a plain search does not:

**`create_safety`** — `exists` / `probable` / `unknown`. This is what lets a workflow branch
update-vs-create WITHOUT an LLM duplicate check. An exact-title hit is `exists`; a strong
semantic hit is `probable`; a weak one is `unknown`. The persist provider keys off the same
logical identity, so the two agree by construction rather than by convention.

**Freshness metadata** — age, last verification, whether it has expired. Reported, never
enforced: whether a three-month-old fact still holds depends on the fact, and a retrieve
that silently hid stale items would make the store's own gaps invisible to the model that
needed to know about them.

**`detail` caps per-result size** rather than being a boolean. `top_k: 10` with full bodies
can blow a downstream stage's context window, and the caller who set `top_k` is rarely the
one who knows the window budget — so `brief`/`compact`/`full` make the cost explicit.

**A degradation ladder with telemetry.** vector → FTS → substring, and which tier answered
is in the output. A retrieve that quietly fell back to substring matching looks identical to
one that used embeddings, and the synthesis built on it would be trusted equally.

    🔴 **1 — the join compared the wrong columns.** `JOIN items i ON i.id = f.rowid` joins a TEXT id
    against an INTEGER rowid, which matches no row, so this rung answered `[]` for every query in
    every store — the documented degradation tier was dead on arrival (#1781). Measured: the same
    store's own `search_items_fts("latency")` returned 1 hit while this returned 0.

    🔴 **2 — and fixing only the join is not enough**, which is the trap here. FTS5 treats the query
    string as an EXPRESSION, so an ordinary user query is a syntax error, and the `except Exception`
    below swallows it into the same empty list. Measured with the join already corrected:

        "latency"     -> 1 hit
        "cold-start"  -> OperationalError: no such column: start
        'latency"'    -> OperationalError: unterminated string
        "AND"         -> OperationalError: fts5: syntax error near "AND"
        "x:y"         -> OperationalError: no such column: x

    hyphen is all it takes. The query goes through `KnowledgeStore._sanitize_fts5`, the store's own
