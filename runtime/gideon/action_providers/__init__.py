"""Action providers — pluggable execution backends for trigger actions.

Each provider implements `ActionProvider` and is registered with the local
registry. The bundled `bash-action` and `webhook-action` extensions register
the two built-in providers at startup. A trigger (a lifecycle hook today, any
trigger after the Triggers unification) picks an action by provider name + config.
