"""No-model degraded mode — the platform-wide fallback contract (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §5).

Every model-dependent surface declares its LLM-free tier explicitly, so offline
operation is *designed* rather than accidental. A degraded surface never
error-walls: it does less, says so, and (where a queue exists) leaves the rest for
a drain when a provider returns.

A ``DegradedContract`` names the surface, the model use-cases it needs, a
human-readable floor statement, and a read-only ``backlog_probe`` for its
pending-enrichment count. Availability is the cheap no-instantiate probe
``can_resolve_use_case`` over every needed use-case — so this registry is derived,
never persisted (§7: recomputable, so never stored).

Scope note (honest, verified against code 2026-07-25): three floors the plan names
are **future infrastructure** and are NOT built here — LEARN-R19's memory-staging
log, KNOW-R17's heuristic knowledge extractor, and the synthesis watchers all live
in unbuilt Workflows-v2 plans. This session registers the floors that exist *today*
(with real backlog probes where a store already tracks the deficit, and an honest
``0`` where the queue is future infra) and the ``drain`` hook is ``None`` for every
contract — drains become §4 remediation-engine jobs when that lands.
