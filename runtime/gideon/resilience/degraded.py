"""No-model degraded mode — the platform-wide fallback contract (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §5).

Every model-dependent surface declares its LLM-free tier explicitly, so offline
operation is *designed* rather than accidental. A degraded surface never
error-walls: it does less, says so, and (where a queue exists) leaves the rest for
a drain when a provider returns.

A ``DegradedContract`` names the surface, the model use-cases it needs, a
human-readable floor statement, and a read-only ``backlog_probe`` for its
pending-enrichment count. Availability is the cheap no-instantiate probe
``can_resolve_use_case`` over every needed use-case — so this registry is derived,
never persisted (§7: recomputable, so never stored).

Scope note (verified against code 2026-08-24): the three floors this module used to
call "future infrastructure" now EXIST, so they are declared rather than deferred
(PR2-9). LEARN-R19's staging log is real (``learning.staging.StagingStore``:
``flush_records`` + unconsumed-entry backlog), the no-model knowledge-ingest tier is
real (the raw/LLM-free ingest graph, which lands an item ``partial`` with
"insights: model unavailable" — the stamp KNOW-R17 describes), and synthesis
watchers are real (``mode: append_evidence`` persists evidence with no model while
``knowledge.staleness`` counts what the compiled section has not caught up with).

Each of those three surfaces therefore carries BOTH halves of the contract: a
backlog probe that counts its own deficit and a ``drain`` that re-enriches it when a
provider returns. Drains are fired here, on the unavailable→available transition
(§5.1) — ``evaluate`` runs in a worker thread, so :func:`_fire_drain` schedules onto
a running loop when there is one and otherwise runs the coroutine to completion in
that thread. A drain reports how many items it moved; it never raises into the
caller and never blocks the poll it rides on.
