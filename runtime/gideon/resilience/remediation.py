"""Health-scored self-remediation engine (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §4).

ONE background engine that replaces N independent maintenance crons, shaped on
GBrain's ``doctor --remediate --target-score --max-usd``: compute a health score
from **measured** deficits, build a dependency-ordered plan, execute step-by-step
re-checking the score after each step, and stop at whichever comes first —
``target_score`` reached, ``max_cost_usd`` spent, or plan exhausted.

Design tenets (from the plan's risk table): this is a **plan-executor over declared
jobs, not a policy brain**. Deficit inputs are measured counts, ordering is declared
``after:`` edges, stopping is three plain caps, and per-job cooldowns are the "dumb
cooldown".

**SOLE ownership of periodic maintenance (§4.4, PR2-11 then PR2-8).** This engine owns the
maintenance it absorbed — memory FTS reconciliation, the daily history and SEL prunes,
skill-library aging — and it is the only implementation of each: the heartbeat's duplicate
per-tick copies were deleted with the engine's re-homing, so there is no second cadence to
fall back to and none to drift from. ``resilience.remediation.enabled=false`` therefore means
what "disabled" means for every other automation: the pass does not run, and every job stays
callable on demand through ``POST /api/doctor/remediation/run``. That is criterion #6 ("the
old heartbeat maintenance no longer runs independently") at its literal strength.

**How it is driven (§4.3, PR2-8).** As ONE adaptive-clock trigger, ``system:self-remediation``,
``created_by: system``, visible and editable on the Triggers page like any other automation —
NOT from a private scheduler inside the heartbeat loop. ``action_providers/remediation_provider``
is the seam; this module knows nothing about triggers and is still callable directly (the Doctor
panel's Run-now does exactly that).

Cadence note: absorbed maintenance is now **deficit-driven, not clock-driven**. A job runs
when its measured backlog drops the health score below ``target_score``, so the deficits
below are weighted such that a *material* backlog crosses the default gate
(100 − 90 = 10 penalty points) rather than waiting for a fixed tick.

Cost: deterministic jobs (FTS rebuild, faiss re-index, prune) cost $0 and never block
on budget. Judgment jobs (re-extraction, semantic lint) would run through
``one_shot_completion`` under the SpendMeter — none are registered yet (their inputs
are future flywheel/knowledge infra); the two-lane mechanism is here for them.
