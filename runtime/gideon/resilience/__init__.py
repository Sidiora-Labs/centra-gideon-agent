"""Platform resilience — diagnosis and degradation substrate (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE).

Gideon is a constellation of degradable subsystems (gateway, app-backend
subprocesses, channel transports, local-model providers, memory/knowledge stores,
the FE static-dist symlink) whose failure history is dominated by *silent*
degradation. This package makes that visible.

Session 1 (this slice) ships the Doctor core:

* :mod:`gideon.resilience.doctor` — a tiered read-only probe framework
  (process → socket → cheap-RPC → per-capability), a flat probe registry, and
  ``run_doctor()`` with downward short-circuiting and the "capability-degraded is
  never core failure" doctrine. Probes are read-only by contract: an exception
  becomes an ``ok=False`` result, never a 500.

Session 2 adds the platform-wide no-model degraded contract:

* :mod:`gideon.resilience.degraded` — a ``DegradedContract`` registry (one per
  model-dependent surface, declaring its LLM-free floor + a read-only backlog probe),
  ``evaluate()`` deriving each surface's availability from ``can_resolve_use_case``,
  and down/recovery transition notifications.

Later sessions add confirm-gated auto-fixes, the trust/debug simulators, mid-turn
message handling, and the health-scored self-remediation engine (see
``docs/roadmap/plans/PLATFORM-RESILIENCE.md``).
