    One predicate, one owner. Two callers ask this question and must agree: the
    gateway decides whether to auto-open the dashboard, and ``gideon setup``
    decides whether to point at the dashboard's guided first run. A second copy of
    the heuristic would drift, and the failure is silent either way — a suppressed
    pointer, or an instruction the user cannot follow.

    The case with no browser is a headless REMOTE session: an SSH shell with no
    display server. macOS is exempt because ``open(1)`` reaches the console user's
    browser even from an SSH shell. WSL reports True — it has neither ``$DISPLAY``
    nor the SSH variables — which is correct, because ``wslview`` hands the URL to
    the Windows default browser (see :func:`gideon.gateway._open_dashboard`).

    Deliberately NOT the same question as "is this host remote"
    (``dashboard/origin.py``, ``cli_doctor``): a remote host WITH a display can open
    a browser, and those two format a URL differently for a remote user whether or
    not one is available. Pure and side-effect-free.
