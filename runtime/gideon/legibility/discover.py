"""Discover — a curated tour of what Gideon can do for you (Platform-Legibility §6).

The dashboard "Discover" section and the dedicated Discover hub read this. It answers
one question, from the *user's* side: *which parts of this system have I not tried yet?*
— then points at them.

Deliberately NOT tool-derived. The tool surface is an implementation detail the user
is never meant to drive by hand, so a "you haven't called `knowledge_add` yet" nudge is
noise. Instead this is a **hand-authored catalog** of the system's user-facing areas
(Chat, Goal loops, Tasks, Projects, Knowledge, Memory, Automation, Inbox, Skills, Apps),
each a one- or two-sentence lesson with a deep link into the page that owns it.

Two ways a tip leaves the feed, both hide-only:

* **Dismiss** — an explicit X. Persisted forever in ``entity_settings/legibility.json``
  (the notifications-settings pattern), so it never resurfaces.
* **Auto-hide when used** — once the user has actually engaged that area, the tip drops
  on its own. "Engaged" is a cheap read of state that already exists (a chat session on
  disk, a knowledge item, a scheduled job…), computed by :func:`compute_engaged`.

**Propose-don't-write (the soul guardrail, unchanged from §6):** every tip only *points*
(a deep link into an existing page) and *hides* (dismiss / auto-hide). Nothing here ever
enables or configures a feature on the user's behalf — the human acts.
