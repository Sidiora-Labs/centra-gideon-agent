"""Capability-discovery power-ups (Platform-Legibility §6).

The dashboard widget's data source. It answers one question the self-description
machinery made computable for the first time: *of the capabilities this instance
has, which has the user never touched?* — then proposes ONE of them at a time as
a two-sentence mini-lesson with a "try it" deep link.

Inputs, all existing or free by-products:

* the §1 manifest ``tools[]`` — the **denominator** (every registered tool, with
  its description + worked examples from ``TOOL_META``);
* :class:`~gideon.legibility.tool_usage.ToolUsageStore` — the tools the user
  has actually invoked (the "touched" set);
* per-capability dismissals persisted in ``entity_settings/legibility.json`` (the
  notifications-settings pattern) — a dismissed capability never resurfaces.

**Propose-don't-write (the soul guardrail):** the lesson is a deterministic
template over the manifest entry — no LLM call, no config write, no capability
ever enabled on the user's behalf. The widget only points; the user acts.

A capability is teachable only if the manifest gives it a worked ``example`` —
that both guarantees a concrete "try it" and filters the low-level surface down
to things worth surfacing. Ordering is deterministic (by name) so the "next"
power-up is stable across polls until the user touches or dismisses the current one.
