"""Always-on conventions inventory — the legibility surface for what EVERY session receives.

Gideon already has both halves of the always-on layer: skills carry an ``always: true``
frontmatter flag (``skills/loader.py:get_always_skills``, rendered into the prompt by
``SkillsLoader.get_context``) and a project's context dir supplies instruction docs that
``project_context`` inlines into every session bound to that project. This module adds only the
missing **legibility** surface. It deliberately does NOT introduce a parallel always-on "steering"
store: a second always-on mechanism competing with always:true-skills + project instructions would
violate one-path-per-concern, and the two would drift.

**The viewer renders slices of the session's own text, it does not re-walk the tree.**
That is the whole design constraint. A viewer that computed its own idea of the conventions would
be worse than no viewer, because it drifts silently while the user trusts it. So:

* The always-on skill tier is **parsed out of** ``SkillsLoader.get_context(agent=...)`` — the exact
  string a session receives. Nothing here iterates the skills dirs or re-reads frontmatter to decide
  what is always-on; if ``get_context`` stops emitting a skill, it leaves the viewer in the same
  breath.
* The project tier comes from ``project_context.inlined_context_files`` — the repo's own answer to
  "which context files did the project block ACTUALLY inline", CONTENT-based rather than name-based
  — plus the same ``read_overview``/``read_ledger`` readers the session preamble calls.

**Why this module does not assemble a session prompt at runtime.** The full composer
(``ContextBuilder.build_session_context``) is not a pure read: it routes the skill block through the
budgeted ambient allocator, which calls ``_record_ambient_measurements`` and persists a
budget-utilization sample plus (on a daily cadence) an ablation sweep. A read-only viewer that
mutated learning telemetry on every page open would be a defect. So the runtime path reads the
producers, and ``tests/test_legibility_always_on.py`` closes the remaining gap by asserting every
item this module reports is a substring of a really-assembled ``build_session_context`` output —
with a vacuity floor, so an empty-vs-empty match can never pass for agreement.

Provenance is reported as ``scope`` (global vs project — what the plan asks the user to see) plus a
finer ``source`` (bundled / user / agent:<name> / project:<id>).

Editability follows the underlying contract rather than convenience: the project **overview** is
current state, revised in place, so it is editable; the **ledgers** are append-only history, so they
are read-only here. Rewriting history through a viewer would silently destroy the one tier whose
value is that it is not rewritten.

List responses carry a credential-redacted ``preview``; the editor round-trip (single-doc GET and
PUT) carries the body verbatim, because redacting a body the user is about to save back would write
the redaction over their real text.
