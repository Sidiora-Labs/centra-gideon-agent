"""Structured context compaction for the native agent loop (the compact hook).

The native loop owns its history (``runtime._messages``), so Gideon owns its
compaction — a far richer pass than head/tail truncation, implemented as a
``ContextCompressor``. Order matters: the cheap **no-LLM tool-output pruning
pre-pass** runs FIRST (it often reclaims enough on its own from verbose shell /
file / search output), THEN a 4-region structure protects the head + recent tail
and folds the middle into a structured summary that preserves *intent + which
files matter* — not a vague blob.

Message shapes (native loop):
- ``{"role": "user"|"assistant", "content": str, "tool_calls"?: [...]}}``
- ``{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": str, "content": str}``

Design properties:
- **Anti-thrashing:** skip if the last 2 compactions each saved <10% (no infinite
  re-compaction).
- **Tool-pair integrity:** never leave an orphaned tool-result (a tool message
  whose matching assistant tool_call was dropped) — they break the provider.
- **Anchoring:** the latest user + assistant messages always survive in the tail.
- **Prefix guard:** the summary is fenced "[CONTEXT COMPACTION — REFERENCE ONLY]"
  so only the live tail wins over stale state.
- **No-LLM safe:** ``summarize_fn=None`` produces a structured deterministic
  digest, so compaction always works (and is testable) without a model call.
- **The resume account survives (CE2-10):** a compacted session carries an explicit
  structured account of what already happened, DERIVED from the folded region's own
  tool_calls/tool-result pairs rather than left to the summary. A block already in the
  history is carried through VERBATIM (its facts came from messages that are already
  gone, so re-deriving it is impossible), and a fresh one is derived for the region this
  pass is about to fold. Both sit immediately before the verbatim tail — beside the live
  task, never in place of it: ``protect_tail`` is untouched, so the account cannot evict
  the messages the turn is actually acting on. Two blocks is the ceiling, so the carried
  weight is bounded at ``2 × MAX_ACCOUNT_CHARS``.
