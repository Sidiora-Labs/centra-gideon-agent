"""Pluggable context engine — the swappable seam for turn-context assembly.

PClaw assembles a turn's context monolithically in ``context.ContextBuilder``
(``build_message`` → ``build_session_context``: agent prompt + memory + skills +
lessons + history + episodic). This module wraps that behind a small 4-hook
``ContextEngine`` contract so the assembly is a **replaceable seam** without
touching the hot path — the substrate that active-recall (the ``assemble`` hook)
and structured-compaction (the ``compact`` hook) build on, instead of each
hacking ``context.py``.

Four lifecycle hooks per run:
- ``ingest`` — a new message was added (store/index it).
- ``assemble`` — before each model run: produce the full prompt the model sees,
  reporting how much context was injected.
- ``compact`` — when the window is full / ``/compact``: summarize older history.
- ``after_turn`` — persist state or trigger background work.

Design constraints (matching PClaw's posture):
- **Single active engine** (like PClaw's single-active-provider patterns).
- **Failure isolation:** a custom engine that raises is quarantined and the call
  downgrades to the built-in default engine, so chat never goes dark. Host
  requirements are checked up front and fail closed.
- The DEFAULT engine is a thin delegate over the existing ``ContextBuilder`` — so
  default behavior is byte-identical to calling ``build_message`` directly.
