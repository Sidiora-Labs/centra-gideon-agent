Which voice serves ``tts`` is the active selection in ``active_models.json``

    TTS selection, or None when no voice is selected. ``speed`` maps the
    behavioral ``speed`` setting (default 1.0); ``speech_voice`` is the persona
    used by remote providers (alloy / nova / …), ignored by Piper. Each provider
    turns ``voice`` into whatever it needs (Piper a local ``.onnx``, OpenAI a
    hosted model id), so callers stay provider-agnostic.

    Profile-aware (MULTIMODAL-IO §3.2): ``surface`` (``channel:webui``,
    ``agent:<slug>``, …) and an ``profile_id`` override walk the four-level chain
    (explicit > binding > default > built-in). When a profile wins, its provider /
    model / speed shadow the flat selection and the dict grows a SUPERSET of keys —
    ``profile_id``, ``profile_level``, ``ref_audio`` (absolute, the locked clip when
    the profile is locked), ``ref_text``, ``seed``, ``instruct``, ``design_params``,
    ``locked``. When nothing resolves (the common case, and every case before a user
    creates a profile) the returned dict is EXACTLY the pre-profile six keys, so an
    empty store reproduces today's flat output rather than merely approximating it.

    The conditioning keys are carried, not consumed: threading ``ref_audio``/``seed``
    into ``TtsProvider.synthesize`` needs the capability flags MI-2 adds, and handing
    a reference clip to a non-cloning engine would be the silent wrong-voice
    synthesis the plan forbids.
