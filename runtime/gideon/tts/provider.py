"""Abstract base for TTS providers — the INFERENCE axis (``synthesize``).

TTS as a capability: turn text into audio. Model MANAGEMENT (download/delete voices) is
a SEPARATE axis: a LOCAL backend (piper) subclasses :class:`LocalTtsProvider` (which mixes
in :class:`~gideon.local_models.provider.LocalModelProvider` and bridges its voices
to the uniform local-model contract); a REMOTE/hosted backend (OpenAI TTS) subclasses only
:class:`TtsProvider` — its voices aren't downloaded/managed, so it carries no voice-
management stubs. The two axes are independent.
