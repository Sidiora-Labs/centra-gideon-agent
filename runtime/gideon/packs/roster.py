"""Agent/roster packs — staged rosters + the ``always``-tier deploy (AGENT-PACKS §4.2, AP-4).

A *roster pack* is an ordinary pack whose dominant components are agent personas, plus two
extra members the manifest does not list as components:

* ``agents/catalog.json`` — the roster: one row per persona, carrying the presentation
  fields (``label``/``icon``/``color``) and, load-bearing, an **activation tier**;
* ``agents/runbooks/<slug>.json`` — optional scenario runbooks, each naming the roster
  slugs that scenario needs.

Two rules make the difference between "a pack of agents" and a roster:

**Every slug must resolve, or the import is refused.** A catalog row or runbook that names
a persona the pack does not carry would install a roster whose one-click deploy silently
skips a member — so :func:`lint_roster` emits an ERROR naming the exact unresolved ref
(``agent:<slug>``), and the importer's existing lint gate turns that into a refusal BEFORE
any byte is written. The check runs against ORIGINAL component ids, because that is the
namespace the pack author wrote.

**Only the ``always`` tier deploys.** :func:`deploy_roster` promotes the ``always`` rows into
``config.json``'s ``agents{}`` map (the seam ``resolve_bindings`` actually reads — persona
body, voice, model and skills all land as an :class:`AgentProfile`, so a deployed agent is
selectable and behaves as its persona). ``phase-N`` and ``as-needed`` rows are installed but
stay DORMANT: their personas exist in the agent store, and nothing makes them a live agent
until a human surfaces them. A pack that could enable its whole staged roster on install
would be arming a team nobody hired.

The roster itself is staged at ``packs/staged/<pack>/roster.json`` (the same propose-don't-write
staging area §3.1 uses for triggers and config), rewritten to the FRESH ids a commit assigned,
so a deploy months later resolves the personas that actually landed.
