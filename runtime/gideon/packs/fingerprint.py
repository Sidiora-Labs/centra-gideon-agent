"""Project-fingerprint auto-surfacing (AGENT-PACKS §7, AP-7).

Packs get *discovered*, not only installed: a project that binds a codebase on disk
(:attr:`gideon.tasks.models.Project.workspace_dir`) is matched against the file-shape
rules packs declare, and a match **proposes** a pack. Four properties are the whole point,
and each one is a mechanism here rather than a promise in a docstring:

**Zero-LLM.** The scanner is deterministic file-shape matching: sorted walk, glob match,
literal substring signals inside the files a glob already selected. No model call, no
provider, no sampling seam — this module imports none of them, and
``tests/test_packs_fingerprint.py`` asserts that statically (an AST sweep over this file's
imports) *and* dynamically (a scan with the model-call audit sink wired to explode records
zero attempts). "Zero-LLM" is otherwise unfalsifiable prose.

**On project-create and on-demand ONLY.** :func:`scan_project` takes a mandatory ``reason``
from :data:`SCAN_REASONS` and raises on anything else, so a background loop cannot quietly
acquire a scan: it would have to invent a reason name and fail. Nothing in this module
schedules itself, and no read path (``GET /api/projects/{id}``) calls it.

**Propose-only.** A scan writes NOTHING. :func:`scan_project` returns
:class:`PackProposal` values; installing is a separate, human-driven call into
:mod:`packs.import_`. The one thing this module ever persists is a *rejection* — the user's
"no" — which is written only by :func:`reject_proposal`.

**A rejection is remembered per (project, pack) and never re-nags.**
``<home>/packs/fingerprint_rejections.json`` (§9) holds ``{project_id: {pack: decided_at}}``
and :func:`scan_project` filters against it, so a second scan after a rejection is silent.

``packs.fingerprint_enabled = false`` stops scanning entirely — checked first, before the
workspace is even resolved, so "off" costs zero directory reads.
