"""Pack UPDATE — overwrite only what the pack owns, never a copy the user edited (§1, AP-7).

Installing a pack is a one-way write; *updating* one is the dangerous direction, because the
files a new version wants to replace may be files the user has since been editing. The §1
``pack_owned`` rule (the ``distribution_owned`` pattern) makes that decidable rather than a
judgement call, and this module is that rule's whole implementation:

* **Only ``pack_owned`` components are candidates.** A component whose pack-relative path no
  ``pack_owned`` pattern matches is never touched by an update — the pack shipped it once and
  disclaimed ongoing ownership. The patterns used are the ones the **installed** pack
  declared, not the ones the incoming archive declares, so a new version cannot widen its own
  ownership and thereby acquire the right to clobber a file the user has been living in.
* **A drifted copy is skipped with a visible note.** Install stamps a
  ``{source, computedHash}`` lock per component (§1, the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL convention). An
  update re-derives the digest: equal means the on-disk copy is still the pack's own bytes and
  is safe to replace; different means the user edited it, and it is skipped with a
  :attr:`ComponentUpdate.reason` a UI shows. Absent means unverifiable — also skipped, because
  "I cannot tell whether you edited this" must not resolve to "so I'll overwrite it".

The digest is ONE algorithm for files and directories alike (:func:`component_digest`), so a
skill and a template cannot drift into two different notions of "changed". It answers a
different question from :func:`skills.marketplace.verify_skill_integrity` — that one reports
per-file tamper for a security audit; this one is a single value per component ref, which is
what a ledger row can hold — so neither is a fork of the other.

An update runs the SAME refusal gates as an install (integrity recompute, referential lint,
supply-chain scan by origin) through :func:`packs.import_.inspect_pack`: a malicious "update"
is just a malicious pack, and it gets no softer treatment for arriving second.
