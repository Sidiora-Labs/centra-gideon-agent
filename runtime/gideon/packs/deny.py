"""Structural redaction layer — the files a pack NEVER opens (AGENT-PACKS §2.2 layer 1).

A pack is shareable *capability configuration*, not a backup. So its exclude-set is
strictly WIDER than a portable export's: an export carries the owner's own data to a new
machine (memory, notifications, run history all travel), but a pack must carry none of it
— a recipient's assistant must not inherit the author's episodic memory, personal
documents, or session transcripts, let alone a credential.

This is the STRUCTURAL half of the two-layer defence. It EXTENDS
``portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE`` (imported, not re-listed — a second hand-maintained list is
exactly the drift that let stores escape coverage before, per portability.py's own S182
note) with the user-DATA stores a pack additionally refuses. The rule the whole pack
build obeys: a path under any denied name is **never opened**, not merely dropped after
reading — the exporter's readers are an allowlist of the §1 component stores, and every
candidate read passes :func:`is_denied` first. Fails CLOSED: on any doubt the path is
denied.
