"""One-link setup export — a pack as a single JSON document (AGENT-PACKS §2.3/§4.4, AP-4).

"Here is my setup" without the ZIP ceremony: the SAME :class:`packs.build.PackPreview`
content, serialized as one shareable JSON file/link. Small members ride inline as base64;
larger ones ride as a ``url`` + ``sha256`` so a big skill bundle does not bloat the link.

**It is a serialization, not a second format.** :func:`import_onelink` materializes the
document back into a byte-exact ``.pclaw`` and then calls :func:`packs.import_.import_pack` —
so a one-link import goes through the identical §3 pipeline (quarantine, integrity recompute,
referential-integrity lint, supply-chain scan, leaves-first journaled commit, rollback,
connector resolution). There is deliberately no second importer to keep in sync, because a
second importer is a second set of security decisions to get wrong.

**Per-resource hashes are the verification, and they are enforced.** Every member carries its
own ``sha256``; :func:`materialize` re-hashes the bytes it actually obtained and REFUSES on
any mismatch, before a ``.pclaw`` exists. That makes a partial/URL-backed fetch verifiable
member by member rather than "trust the link". The pack-level ``content_hash`` inside
``pack.json`` is then re-derived independently by the importer, so a doctored one-link
document has to survive two unrelated checks.
