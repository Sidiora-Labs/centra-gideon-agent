"""Pack import core — inspect-without-write, leaves-first commit, journaled rollback (AP-2).

The exact inverse of :mod:`packs.build`. Where the exporter walks a closure and writes a
``.gideon`` ZIP, the importer opens one and installs its components onto THIS machine —
and it is the more dangerous half: a pack is untrusted third-party content that ships
executable skills, so a malicious or corrupt pack must not be able to write a dangerous
skill, corrupt state, or leave a half-written mess. The whole module is built around one
property: **atomicity** — a fault at any point unwinds to byte-identical pre-import state.

The pipeline (AGENT-PACKS §3.1), every step fail-closed and SEL-audited:

1. **inspect (dry-run, NO home writes)** — :func:`inspect_pack` opens the ZIP, extracts to
   a SYSTEM tempdir (never the home), re-derives ``content_hash`` from the ACTUAL member
   bytes and compares to the manifest (integrity recompute — the manifest's value is never
   trusted), runs the referential-integrity + parse lint (:mod:`packs.lint`), and scans
   every component with :class:`supply_chain.SkillScanner` at the origin's trust tier. It
   returns an :class:`ImportPlan` — a preview of exactly what a commit would install,
   including each component's fresh local id and scan verdict — WITHOUT touching home state.
2. **commit (leaves-first, journaled)** — :func:`import_pack` runs the same inspect, then
   refuses on any blocking condition (integrity mismatch, lint error, a DANGEROUS component
   regardless of consent, a WARNING component without consent). Only then does it commit,
   leaves-first (skills → prompts → agents → templates → triggers → config), journaling every
   write to ``packs/.installing/<id>.json`` BEFORE it happens. Skills commit through
   :class:`PackMarketplace` → ``install_guarded`` (the shared gate → ``.gideon-lock.json``).
   Fresh local ids are assigned on collision and every intra-pack reference is rewritten on
   the PARSED object (never string-replaced over raw bytes — a byte splice corrupts). Any
   exception triggers rollback: every journaled write is unwound leaves-last (reverse order),
   restoring byte-identical pre-import state — no partial packs.

Triggers land DISABLED and config_subset lands STAGED (never applied): a pack cannot arm
automation or edit config on install — those are human-enabled from their own surfaces later
(§3.1 propose-don't-write applied to distribution).
