"""Installed-pack ledger (AGENT-PACKS §9, AP-3).

``<home>/packs/installed.json`` records what each imported pack put on this machine: its
components, the resolution of each connector requirement (§3.3), and its post-install
setup skill (§3.4). It is the READER surface behind two done_when contracts:

* a **skipped connector** degrades with a machine-readable ``connector_missing:<name>``
  marker recorded here, so a connector-dependent feature (and the pack detail page) can
  read "this is unavailable" without re-deriving it;
* a **setup skill** is re-runnable — the ledger keeps ``setup_pending`` true while a pack
  carries one, so the "Finish setup" chip always has something to re-invoke.

It is NOT the import journal (:class:`packs.import_._Journal` — the crash-safe rollback
ledger, deleted on success). This ledger is the durable post-install record; it is written
only after a commit fully succeeds, so it never describes a rolled-back pack.
