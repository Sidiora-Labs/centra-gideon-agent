"""Portable ``.gideon`` packs — the shareable bundle format (AGENT-PACKS §1-§2).

A pack is a ZIP of *capability configuration only* — skills, workflow templates,
prompts and agents — that one user can hand to another. The existential risk is a
secret riding along, so redaction is TWO independent layers, defence-in-depth:

* the STRUCTURAL layer (:mod:`packs.deny`) never opens a secret/user-data file — the
  exporter's readers are an allowlist of the §1 component stores, and every read is
  routed through a home-relative deny check that fails CLOSED;
* the CONTENT layer (:func:`packs.build.build_pack`) scans every component's text with
  ``security.redact`` + ``guardrails.scan_outbound`` and BLOCKS any credential-bearing
  component rather than shipping it redacted.

AP-1 is the format + export core: the dependency-closure walker, the two redaction layers,
and a look-before-write :func:`preview_pack`. AP-2 (this atom) is the import inverse:
:func:`inspect_pack` (dry-run, no writes) and :func:`import_pack` (leaves-first commit with
a journaled rollback, referential-integrity lint, and scan-by-origin trust). The connector
catalog and the export/import UI routes are later AP atoms.
