"""web_fetch pipeline — the layered, guarded fetch behind the `web_fetch` tool.

    ① URL-provenance gate   — the URL must have appeared in context (returned by a
                              prior web_search / web_fetch in this session). A
                              mitigation against model-fabricated-URL exfil, layered
                              with ② (not relied on alone).
    ② egress chokepoint     — net.fetch (SSRF-safe: IP-pinned, redirect-revalidated).
    ③ extract               — the shared trafilatura/nh3 core (web/extract.py).
    ④ token economy         — cap to max_tokens; offset pagination (start_index →
                              next_index) so a large page is read in chunks.

Provenance is tracked per-session in-process: web_search records the URLs it surfaced
(:func:`record_seen_urls`) and web_fetch records the page it fetched, so a follow-up
fetch of a link found mid-conversation passes the gate. The gate is advisory — every
fetch still goes through the egress guard regardless.
