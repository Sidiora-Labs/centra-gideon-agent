"""Web fetch/extract pipeline — the hardened path behind the `web_fetch` tool.

Content extraction (`extract.py`) is the shared core both `web_fetch` and the
knowledge web-url connector use, so there is ONE boilerplate-removing extractor (not
two forks). The fetch pipeline itself routes through the egress chokepoint
(`gideon.net`) so a fetch is never unguarded.
