"""Skill bodies allocate on the ONE prompt budget (CONTEXT-ECONOMY CE2-9).

Before this module a matched skill's full body was **concatenated straight into the
prompt** — `context.py` did `parts.add(f"[Skill: {name}]\\n{body}\\n[End of skill]")` for
every forced and every surfaced skill, with nothing measuring the result. Two properties
followed, and both are defects:

* **Load order beat priority.** Whoever appended got the room. A 40,000-token skill did
  not compete with anything; it simply took the window and the conversation got what was
  left. The allocator (`learning/surfacing.allocate`) existed, declared a `skills` slot,
  and never saw a skill body — only the skill *index*.
* **Nothing was answerable.** "Why did my skill not take effect?" had no answer, because
  no decision was recorded anywhere. Either the body was in the prompt or the provider
  returned a 400.

So skill bodies now enter :func:`gideon.learning.surfacing.allocate` as candidates
in its existing ``skills`` slot, and the outcome is a **declared value** per skill in a
closed set of three (:class:`SkillLoadState`).

**Two caps, one mechanism.** Each skill declares its **resource tier** — the frontmatter
key is ``context_tier`` (:data:`CONTEXT_TIERS`) because "resource tier" already names
WF2LEA-10's ``resources:`` block in this very frontmatter, and one file cannot carry two
meanings of the phrase. That tier is the skill's **per-skill** ceiling, and the turn's
skills share an **aggregate** ceiling (:data:`AGGREGATE_CAP_TOKENS`). Both are honored
INSIDE the allocator by the same test (``surfacing._tier_fits``) and degrade through the
same tier ladder — a per-skill pre-filter beside a budget would be two mechanisms again,
which is precisely what this atom removes.

**Reduced, never truncated.** A body over its allocation is replaced by the skill's own
**declared** summary (`description`) and entry points (its `resources:` block) —
:func:`reduced_block`. A body cut at a byte boundary is worse than a shorter complete one:
the reader cannot tell it is half, and half a procedure is a procedure that fails at step
four. Nothing here ever slices a body.

**A skill that declares neither is REFUSED, not "reduced" to nothing.** There is no
summary to fall back to, and synthesizing one by taking the first N characters of the body
IS the byte-boundary cut. What loads instead is a one-line pointer
(:func:`pointer_line`) naming the skill and the tool that loads it on demand — an honest
refusal the agent can act on, reported as ``REFUSED`` because no part of the skill's
content reached the prompt.

**The decision is visible and observable.** Every non-admitted skill produces a notice
naming *which* skill and *why*, which rides CE2-8's existing assembly-notice channel
(``notices_out`` → ``AssembledContext.notices`` → ``activity_event {kind:"headroom"}``);
no new channel. The full triple (admitted / reduced / refused) is logged once per turn and
handed back as :attr:`SkillAllocation.decisions` for programmatic readers.

**Continued cost is re-evaluated, not paid once.** This runs inside `build_message`, which
`chat_runner` calls on **every** turn that has a context builder (`chat_runner.py:2041`),
not only on a new session. Nothing caches an admission: a skill admitted at full body on
turn one is re-scored against turn five's query and re-fitted against turn five's
aggregate, and is reduced the moment it no longer earns the room. That is a structural
property of allocating at the per-turn seam rather than a background sweep bolted on.

#:   light    1,000 — below the median: a one-page skill that states a rule or a format.
#:   standard 3,000 — clears 16 of the 17 bundled skills. The DEFAULT, so a skill that
#:                    declares nothing still gets a real allocation rather than a token.
#:   heavy    8,000 — nearly twice the largest thing we ship. A skill only spends this by
#:                    SAYING so, which is the whole point: the cost is declared, and a
#:                    reviewer reading the frontmatter can see which skills are expensive.
#: Numbers, not a knob: the atom asks for a declared tier per skill, and a global override

#: `standard` cap they would want 24,000. 16,000 is therefore the point where the
#: aggregate starts to bind exactly when several skills are simultaneously near their own
#: ceiling — which is the crowd-out case — and never in the ordinary one.
#:
#: Deliberately model-BLIND. `build_message` is synchronous and holds no model ref, and
#: CE2-8's contract already measures the assembled prompt against the bound model's real
