"""Skill sidecar overlays — WF2LEA-6 (§3.1 "Skill application substrate").

An accepted skill refinement applies as a SIDECAR OVERLAY rather than mutating the base
``SKILL.md``: a single file — ``<skills_dir>/.overlays/<name>.json`` — holds the accepted
refinements (few-shot exemplars + description notes) and is merged onto the base body at LOAD
time. Two properties fall out, both load-bearing:

* **Revert = delete ONE file.** Removing the overlay restores the base exactly, so a bad
  refinement is undone without touching (or being able to corrupt) the skill it refines.
* **`install_guarded` locks stay intact.** The overlay lives OUTSIDE the skill directory, so
  ``verify_skill_integrity`` — which hashes every file *inside* ``<skill>/`` against
  ``.gideon-lock.json`` and flags any extra file as ``added`` — never sees it. The base bytes and
  their hashes are never rewritten, so a marketplace-locked skill stays verifiable.

This mirrors the trivial-rollback property templates get from version pinning (``versions.py``):
the base is immutable, the accepted change is a separate, deletable layer.
