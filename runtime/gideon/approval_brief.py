"""OU-9 — the approval brief carried over the core↔channel seam (Contract C2,
``docs/roadmap/plans/ONBOARDING-UX.md``).

A channel (Slack, …) prompts the owner to approve a tool call through
:meth:`~gideon.channel_delivery.ChannelDelivery.request_approval`. Until this
module, the payload it received said WHAT tool wants to run but nothing about what
running it could TOUCH — the blast radius existed only in the dashboard, derived
frontend-side. This module composes the same brief backend-side and stamps it onto
the approval event as **additive meta**, so a phone notification can say the one
line that matters.

── This module DECIDES nothing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
It is descriptive, exactly like its frontend twin. The approval gate, trust-reads
and the task-mode gate live in :mod:`gideon.task_modes` +
:mod:`gideon.gateway` and are unchanged. Every classification here is
CONSUMED from ``task_modes`` — the one invocation vocabulary — never re-derived. In
particular this module never inspects a command string: deciding whether a command
is read-only is security logic and it already has an owner
(:func:`~gideon.task_modes.is_read_only_bash`, reached only via
:func:`~gideon.task_modes.classify_invocation`). C2 says E4 if a gap tempts a
change; nothing here tempted one.

── One vocabulary, two languages ────────────────────────────────────────────────
``web/src/pages/chat/approvalMeta.ts`` (OU-7/OU-8) is the same derivation for the
dashboard's chips and the out-of-context toast. Three surfaces must not invent three
words for one claim, so:

* the name evidence is not copied at all — :data:`WRITE_HINTS`,
  :data:`DESTRUCTIVE_HINTS` and :data:`READ_VERB_HINTS` are DERIVED from
  ``task_modes``' own tuples, the same tuples the TypeScript mirrors. Adding a hint
  to ``task_modes`` flows into the brief automatically;
* the four facet labels are the TypeScript's ``FACET_COPY`` verbatim, and
  ``tests/test_approval_brief.py`` parses that file and asserts every label and
  hint list still agrees. A drift becomes a red test, not a third vocabulary.

── Honesty contract (identical to the frontend's) ───────────────────────────────
Every boolean is a POSITIVE claim: ``False`` means "not established", never
"verified absent". So :func:`derive_blast_radius` returns ``None`` when NOTHING was
established, rather than an all-false object — rendered as a line, all-false reads
"no writes, no network, no shell, not read-only", a confident all-clear derived from
zero evidence, and it is worst on the surface least able to check (the phone).
``read_only`` is claimed only on positive evidence and never survives an established
write, so this module can only ever UNDER-claim safety.

#: The key the brief occupies in ``event.tool_meta``. A channel implementation reads

# ── Tool-name evidence ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Derived from `task_modes`' own tuples so the gate and the brief cannot disagree
# about what a name means. The three deltas below are OU-7's, mirrored here with its
# reasons; `tests/test_approval_brief.py` pins each against `approvalMeta.ts`.

#: Runs a command / spawns a process. ``_MUTATING_NAME_HINTS``' exec family, split out
#: because "can run anything" is its own facet. ``terminal``/``shell``/``zsh`` cover the
#: display names ACP agents send as the title. Deliberately NOT ``run``: the
#: ``project_run_*`` tools drive a workflow run, not a shell.
SHELL_HINTS: tuple[str, ...] = (
    "bash",

    "zsh",
    "exec",

#: Leaves the machine. ``web_fetch``/``web_search`` are the app-provided web tools; the
#: rest cover MCP tools named by convention. This facet has no ``task_modes``
#: counterpart — the gate never needed to ask "does this leave the host?" — so it is
#: OU-7's list, pinned against the TypeScript by test.

    "web_",

    "browse",

    "scrape",
    "url",
)

#: Destructive verbs, ``task_modes``' tuple itself. Checked FIRST and, like
#: ``infer_risk_from_name``, they win outright: a delete is a write to the world.
DESTRUCTIVE_HINTS: tuple[str, ...] = _DESTRUCTIVE_NAME_HINTS

#: Query/inspection verbs, ``task_modes``' tuple itself. Checked BEFORE the broad write
#: hints for the same reason the backend does it: ``schedule_list`` matches the write
#: fragment "schedule" but is plainly a read.
READ_VERB_HINTS: tuple[str, ...] = _READ_VERB_HINTS

#: Hints that belong to another facet (or to none) and so must not also mean "writes".
#: Every destructive verb is excluded by DERIVATION from :data:`DESTRUCTIVE_HINTS` rather
#: than by name: this used to hand-list ``delete``/``remove`` with the reason "already in
#: DESTRUCTIVE_HINTS", which was true of all six and spelled for two. When #2118 widened the
#: gate's tuple, the four it added (``destroy``, ``drop_``, ``purge``, ``forget``) flowed
#: into :data:`WRITE_HINTS` and drifted from the TypeScript mirror — a hand-listed subset of
#: a derived set is the same defect one layer up. ``exec``/``spawn`` moved to
#: :data:`SHELL_HINTS`; ``run`` is dropped outright per :data:`SHELL_HINTS`' note.
_NOT_A_WRITE_HINT = frozenset(DESTRUCTIVE_HINTS) | {"run", "exec", "spawn"}

#: Other writing verbs — ``_MUTATING_NAME_HINTS`` minus the hints re-homed above, plus
#: ``remember``. ``remember`` is the one deliberate divergence from ``task_modes``:
#: ``memory_remember`` durably persists a lesson, so it writes, but the gate's tuple
#: carries no ``remember`` token. Adding it THERE is a change to live risk inference and
#: is not this atom's to make (C2: E4), so the divergence lives here — and the
#: conservative ``read_only`` guard keeps the two consistent where it matters: an
#: established write never claims read-only, whatever the risk says.
WRITE_HINTS: tuple[str, ...] = tuple(
    h for h in _MUTATING_NAME_HINTS if h not in _NOT_A_WRITE_HINT
) + ("remember",)

#: Does a risk level positively establish that the call is a read?
#:
#: Consumed, not invented: :func:`~gideon.task_modes.resolve_effective_risk`
#: reaches ``'safe'`` only through a read-only bash invocation, a declared-SAFE native
#: tool, or a positive read-only ACP ``tool_kind`` — so EFFECTIVE-safe is already derived
#: FROM read-only-ness. ``'caution'``/``'destructive'`` say a call has side effects but
#: not WHICH facet, so they establish nothing here. A level this build has never heard of
