"""Memory ↔ markdown vault (mem-fs-mirror; MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §5).

A projection of the memory store into an Obsidian-compatible markdown vault under
``~/.gideon/memory-vault/`` so a human can browse memory as a linked
knowledge graph (Obsidian graph view + backlinks) instead of squinting at
``memory.db`` — and, in ``two_way`` mode, **edit it back**.

``memory.vault_mode`` (§5.1) picks how far that goes:

``off``
    No vault.
``mirror``
    One direction. The vault is a pure projection of ``MemoryService.get_records()``,
    regenerated from the store and never read back. A hand edit is overwritten — that
    is what "mirror" means, and the config help says so.
``two_way``
    The sync pass reads edited pages back through the normal ``MemoryService`` write
    path before re-projecting (§5.2).

Design — one path, no dual write surface:
  * Reconciliation happens at natural memory-write boundaries (post-consolidation
    seal, the maintenance cadence, and an explicit ``POST /api/memory/vault/sync``),
    NOT by instrumenting every write method or watching the filesystem. The vault
    stays a derived artifact: idempotent, rebuildable from scratch.
  * A content-hash manifest (``.vault-manifest.json``) makes each sync O(changed):
    only pages whose rendered markdown changed are rewritten, and files for records
    that no longer exist are pruned. A full rebuild == delete the manifest.
  * ``[[wikilinks]]`` are derived from **real relations** — ``mem_links`` graph edges,
    supersession chains, shared tags (via tag-hub pages), and session grouping —
    never from scraping the page text. A link the graph does not have cannot appear.

**``source_hash`` is the safety mechanism, and it covers the BODY ONLY.** Every page
carries ``source_hash`` = a hash of everything below the frontmatter fence. The sync
pass rewrites the frontmatter on every pass (counters, ``last_updated``, the hash
itself), so a hash that covered the frontmatter would never match its own page again
and every page would read as hand-edited forever. Body-only also buys the conflict
flag for free: stamping ``sync_conflict`` into the frontmatter of a page we refuse to
touch does not change its body hash, so the page stays flagged until the human
resolves it.

Two-way is *lossy in one direction only*: a page the parser cannot read with
confidence is **left exactly as the human wrote it**, flagged in frontmatter, and
reported by the vault lint. It is never overwritten and never dropped.

Safety: memory text is often *untrusted* (episodic fragments, tool outputs), and a
vault page is worse — a human can paste anything into it. YAML frontmatter values are
JSON-encoded (JSON is a strict subset of YAML), so a value containing ``---`` /
newlines / quotes can never break out of the frontmatter fence or forge extra keys.
Edits read back are written with ``source="vault_edit"``, which is deliberately NOT in
``MemoryService._TRUSTED_WRITE_SOURCES``: the *human's intent* is authoritative, the
*bytes* are not, so they pass the S5 injection scan like any other untrusted write.
