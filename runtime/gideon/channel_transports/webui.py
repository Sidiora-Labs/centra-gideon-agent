"""Web UI channel transport — the dashboard websocket as a peer transport.

The dashboard already routes browser-originated messages through the chat runner
(inbound) and broadcasts assistant output over the websocket fan-out (outbound).
This adapter exposes that outbound path through :class:`ChannelTransportProvider`
so the comms manager can present the Web UI alongside external channel
transports (Slack, …). It is always
"connected" once the dashboard server is up.

The dashboard ``DashboardState`` lives in the gateway aiohttp app
(``app["state"]``); there is no module-global accessor. The comms manager binds
the live state onto this transport (:meth:`bind_state`) before probing health or
sending, so this adapter never reaches for a global that may not exist.
