"""Abstract base for channel transport providers.

A *channel transport* carries messages between Gideon and an external
communication system (the dashboard Web UI, Slack, and future Telegram/Discord).
Each transport owns one external system: it connects, sends outbound messages,
and reports its own health. Inbound delivery is transport-specific — see the
note on the inbound seam below.

**Inbound:** transports do NOT own an inbound dispatch loop here. For a channel
app like Slack, the
Socket-Mode receiver lives in ``gideon.gateway`` and routes inbound
messages straight to chat sessions; for the Web UI, the dashboard chat runner is
the canonical consumer. The ``ChannelManager`` (comms) is a management +
visibility surface over the registered transports, not a second inbound router.
