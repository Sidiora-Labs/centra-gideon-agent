"""Reference channel transport (#41) — a complete, minimal adapter.

This is the worked example referenced by ``docs/ADDING_A_CHANNEL.md``: the smallest
transport that exercises the full normalized contract (#40) — outbound ``send``,
declared ``capabilities``, an inbound ``receive`` loop emitting :class:`ChannelMessage`,
plus ``connect``/``disconnect``/``health``. It "echoes" — outbound sends are recorded
and surfaced back as inbound messages — so it's runnable + testable with no external
system. Copy this file, rename, and swap the echo internals for your real client.

NOT registered by default (it's a teaching reference, not a live channel).
