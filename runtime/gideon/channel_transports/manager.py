"""Comms ChannelManager — management + visibility over registered transports.

This is the comms management surface (distinct from goal-loop orchestration). It does NOT route
inbound messages — a channel app's inbound receiver lives in its own bundle
(e.g. Slack Socket-Mode in ``slack-channel``), Web UI inbound stays in the chat
runner. Its job is the management surface the Channels page
drives: list transports with health, connect/disconnect, and run a "test"
probe. Outbound ``send`` is delegated straight to the named transport.

It reads the live transport registry (``channel_transports`` module dict), which
is populated by the extension system (``ChannelTypeHandler`` registers Slack on
enable) plus the always-present in-app Web UI transport.
