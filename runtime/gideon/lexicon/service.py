"""LexiconService (core LEX) — the vocabulary engine over the LexiconStore.

Owns the four behaviors the design locks:
  * ``rebuild_from_graph`` — sync terms from knowledge-graph entities (name + aliases +
    entity_type), computing Double Metaphone keys. Incremental-friendly (upsert by id).
  * ``select_bias_terms``  — a ranked, budget-capped term list for PRE-decode biasing
    (LEX.3): context entities first (a meeting's own notes prime its audio), then global
    top-weighted top-ups.
  * ``correct``            — POST-decode phonetic correction of a TranscriptResult (LEX.4):
    fires only when it SOUNDS like a Lexicon term, is SPELLED differently, and the source
    word is low-confidence; hybrid policy = auto-apply learned/high-confidence, propose the
    rest.
  * ``learn_correction``   — the feedback loop (LEX.5): upsert heard→meant, raise the
    term's weight, flip auto_apply past threshold.

A module-level ``select_bias_terms`` async wrapper is the seam the TranscriptionNode calls
(so the node needs no service handle); it returns [] when the Lexicon is empty/disabled.
