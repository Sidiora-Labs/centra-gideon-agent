"""Memory formation — the Extract → Gather → Decide pipeline for consolidation.

MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §4.1 (MGAV-5). Consolidation used to extract candidate facts in
one prompt and write them straight in. That is how a memory store accretes both
duplicates ("pref.editor: vim" beside "pref.text_editor: vim") and contradictions (an
old value that was never retired), and neither is visible until the model starts
answering from the wrong one.

The restructure keeps ONE extra model call, no more:

* **Extract** — the existing consolidation prompt, unchanged. Candidates in, nothing
  written yet.
* **Gather** — fully deterministic: for each candidate find the existing rows it might
  collide with (same key, keyword overlap, graph-arm neighbours). Zero model calls.
* **Decide** — ONE structured call for the WHOLE batch: per candidate a verdict of
  ``ADD`` / ``UPDATE`` / ``SUPERSEDE`` / ``NOOP`` plus a one-line reason.

Four safety properties are non-negotiable and each is enforced here rather than trusted
to the model:

1. **No physical deletes, ever.** ``SUPERSEDE`` writes the new row and then calls
   ``supersede_semantic``, which soft-deletes the old row with ``superseded_by`` +
   ``invalidated_at`` and a WAL entry. The superseded row stays READABLE — that is what
   makes a wrong supersede recoverable instead of a silent data loss.
2. **Unsure means keep BOTH.** A contradiction the model flags as unsure — or one where
   holder precedence forbids the overwrite — becomes two live rows joined by a
   ``references`` edge carrying the conflict provenance, surfaced by the memory lint.
   Averaging two contradictory facts into one is how a store starts lying confidently.
3. **Holder precedence is enforced at the DECISION point.** A lower-precedence claim
   (an ``external`` rumour) cannot supersede a higher-precedence one (something the user
   said) no matter what the model returns. Ranking it lower at read time would not be
   the same guarantee.
4. **Fail-safe degradation.** No Decide prompt, no model, or an unparseable response →
   every candidate falls back to ``ADD``, i.e. exactly today's behavior. A formation
   failure must never mean "this session's memories were dropped".
