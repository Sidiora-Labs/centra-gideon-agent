"""On-demand Schedule job triggering.

A thin helper that fires a scheduled job **immediately** by POSTing to the
running gateway's run route — never by instantiating a fresh ``ScheduleService``
(a fresh service has no live timer/reaper and would orphan the run). Reuses
Gideon's internal-secret IPC (``mcp_core._post`` → ``X-Internal-Secret``),
so both the CLI (``gideon cron trigger``) and the ``schedule_trigger`` MCP
tool go through the same authenticated localhost path.
