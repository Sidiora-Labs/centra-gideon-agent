"""Enforcer-owned registries for the governance ceiling (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5).

Matchers and ordinal scales live HERE, in code, and are never sourced from a governed
file. That is the whole point: if a ceiling (or a profile) could name its own matcher
implementation or reorder a strictness scale, it could redefine what "stricter" means and
widen itself while looking narrower. A ceiling may only *reference* a matcher/scale by
name; an unknown name is a boot abort (:class:`UnknownRegistryEntry`), never a fallback.

**The path-matcher rule — our own recorded landmine, encoded here once.** Normalize only
the QUERIED ITEM (expand ``~``/``$VAR``, then ``abspath``, which anchors a relative path
and collapses ``.``/``..``). NEVER run the *pattern* through ``normpath``: ``normpath``
treats ``*``/``**`` as ordinary path segments and collapses an adjacent ``..`` against
them, so ``/a/**/../b`` becomes ``/a/b`` — silently dropping the ``**`` and widening an
allow (or shrinking a deny). Two properties this buys:

1. ``~/ws/../.bashrc`` collapses to ``~/.bashrc`` and no longer matches an allow of
   ``~/ws/**``;
2. an agent-supplied relative ``../../etc/passwd`` is absolutized, so it cannot dodge a
   deny of ``/etc/**`` by failing to match as a string.

``tests/test_guardrails_path_matcher.py`` is the table-driven encoding of the rule: an
implementation that normpaths the pattern reds it.
