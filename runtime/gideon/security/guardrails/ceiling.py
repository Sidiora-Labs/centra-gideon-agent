"""The governance CEILING — level one of "two levels, one rule: tightest wins"
(PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5, AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS S5.2).

Level 1 is this :class:`Ceiling`, loaded ONCE at boot from an operator-owned path the
running agent does not own. Level 2 is the existing :class:`~gideon.security.guardrails.
policy.SafetyProfile`, which may only **narrow**. Effective posture =
``resolve(ceiling, profile)``, and there is no path through this module by which a
profile can hand a run more reach than the ceiling allows.

**Four archetypes, one compose function each.** :func:`compose_ordinal`,
:func:`compose_ruleset`, :func:`compose_gate`, :func:`compose_map`. The evaluator
dispatches on the scope's ARCHETYPE, never on its name — which is what makes adding a
governed scope *data* (one :class:`ScopeSpec` row in :data:`CEILING_SCOPES`) rather than
engine code. A ScopeSpec naming an archetype with no compose function aborts boot.

**Enforcer-owned registries.** Matchers and ordinal scales come from
:mod:`gideon.security.guardrails.registries` and are never sourced from the governed file;
an unknown matcher/scale/value aborts governance boot with a WHAT/WHY/FIX error rather
than falling back to a default that would match differently (see that module's header for
the path-matcher landmine this closes).

**Where the file lives, and what the layer does and does not buy.** Default
``$GIDEON_HOME/governance/ceiling.json``, overridable to an absolute path with
``GIDEON_CEILING_FILE`` (the option that gives a real trust root: put it on a
root-owned ``0444`` file outside the agent's home). On a single-user machine the agent
runs as the user, so no in-process check can make a file unwritable. What this layer DOES
buy, and each is verified by a test:

* **No API write surface.** The ceiling is not config: it is absent from the dashboard's
  ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` PATCH allowlist and has no PUT/POST of its own, so nothing the
  agent can reach over HTTP edits it.
* **Agent write paths refuse it.** ``governance/`` is in the built-in sensitive-path
  denylist, so ``security.is_sensitive_path`` — which the action denylist, the files area
  and the bash hooks all consult — refuses reads and writes of it.
* **No mid-run widening.** It is read once and cached; a successful tamper cannot widen
  the process that is already running, only a later restart, which is a restart an
  operator can see.
* **Tamper evidence.** Boot SEL-audits the resolved source + digest, so a changed ceiling
  is attributable after the fact.

What it does NOT buy: OS-level immutability against a process running as the operator.
That requires the file to live outside the home, owned by another uid.
