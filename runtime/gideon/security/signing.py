"""Artifact signing — the minisign-format verifier the Store runs BEFORE an install.

**Scheme (SH-3 decision):** detached **Ed25519 signatures in minisign's on-wire
format** over a **whole-tree digest manifest**. Rationale, rejected alternatives and
the maintainer workflow live in ``docs/security/SIGNING.md``; this module is the
verifying half and the format's single source of truth. ``scripts/sign_app.py`` is
the signing half.

Two facts make this safe rather than decorative:

1. **The signature covers every byte that gets installed, not just the manifest.**
   A signed bundle carries ``.gideon-signature.sha256`` — a canonical, sorted
   ``sha256  relpath`` line per file in the tree — and ``.gideon-signature.sha256.minisig``,
   the detached signature over that file's exact bytes. Verification re-derives the
   digest manifest from the tree on disk and requires **byte equality** with the signed
   one, so a changed file, an ADDED file, a removed file and a rename are all one
   comparison. Signing only ``app.json`` would leave ``scripts/`` unsigned and swappable;
   that is the hole this shape closes (see ``tests/security/test_app_signature.py``).
2. **Every failure is fail-closed.** Missing half, malformed base64, wrong lengths,
   unknown key, bad signature, digest mismatch, a symlink the manifest cannot honestly
   cover, or a missing Ed25519 backend all return :attr:`SignatureState.INVALID` with a
   reason. A parse error can never read as "valid" — the only path to
   :attr:`SignatureState.SIGNED` is every check passing. Absence of BOTH signature files
   is :attr:`SignatureState.UNSIGNED`, which is a *state*, not a verdict: unsigned
   bundles stay installable at community tier (graduated trust, SECURITY-HARDENING C2).

**Trust store.** ``gideon/trusted_keys/<Signer>.pub`` — minisign-format public
keys, shipped in-tree so a verifying user needs no network and no key-distribution
protocol. The **filename stem is the signer identity** ("Gideon.pub" →
``signed by Gideon``): it comes from the packaged tree, so an attacker cannot
choose the name their bundle is attributed to by editing a comment in their own file.
A key id present in a signature but absent from the store is an unknown key → refused.

**Scope: this verifies a STAGED bundle, not a live one.** The install gate calls
:func:`verify_bundle` on the quarantined copy, and those exact bytes are what moves into
place. A *live* app dir accumulates gateway-written state the signer never saw
(``installed.json``, the app's ``data/``), so re-verifying one legitimately reports drift
— that is not tampering, it is the wrong question. The manifest deliberately excludes no
path other than the two signature files: an exclusion list would be an unsigned region
inside a signed bundle, which is precisely the hole this design closes.
