"""The owner login credential (REMOTE-USER-AUTH C2 / T2.1).

One owner, one credential set. This is **authentication, not multi-tenancy** — the plan's soul
guardrail — so there is deliberately no user table, no roles, and no signup. A username exists
only so the login form has a subject and so it can later graduate into an SSO-provisioned one
(TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES' identity string).

**argon2id, not a hand-rolled PBKDF2.** Memory-hard and tunable, which is the current
recommendation for password storage; rolling our own over `hashlib` to avoid one small wheel
would be the wrong trade on a credential path.

**What is stored, and what is deliberately not.** `auth/credentials.json` (0600) holds the
username, the argon2 hash, the algorithm tag and a timestamp. It does **not** hold:

* the plaintext — obviously, and it is never logged, never put in argv, never returned by an
  API, and never included in a status payload;
* the TOTP secret — that is a *secret*, so it goes to the credential store (`.env`, 0600) via
  `save_credential`, not into a JSON file that the snapshot/export set might later sweep up.

**Failure posture is FAIL-CLOSED.** An unreadable or malformed credential file means "no
credential configured", which means login cannot succeed — never "let them in". The local
`?token=` path is the escape hatch precisely so that failing closed here cannot brick the box.

    * **It fails loudly but non-fatally.** A too-short password logs an error and leaves login
      unconfigured rather than aborting startup: a gateway that will not boot is worse than
      one you have to set a password on, and the local token path still works.
