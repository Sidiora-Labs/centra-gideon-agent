"""Single-use device PAIRING codes (COMPANION-APPS C2 / T1.1).

A sibling of :mod:`gideon.security.auth.enrollment`, deliberately not a merge with it. Both mint
a short code redeemable for one session, but they answer to different surfaces and different
lifetimes: an enrollment code is a recovery affordance minted by `gideon auth enroll` at
the box, while a pairing code is minted by the running dashboard, displayed as a QR, and
redeemed by a companion app that then wants to be *named and revocable* — which is the whole
reason its redemption writes device provenance into the session row.

Folding them into one module would mean one function whose behavior forks on a `kind` flag
through five branches, which is how the two surfaces would drift apart while looking unified.
They share their security properties instead of their code path, and those properties are
asserted separately.

**Every property here exists to bound the blast radius of an 8-character string:**

* **single-use** — the record is removed and persisted BEFORE the caller mints a session, so
  two simultaneous redemptions cannot both succeed;
* **short-lived** — :data:`PAIR_CODE_TTL_SECS`. A code that lingers is a password with a
  shorter alphabet;
* **rate-limited by scarcity** — at most :data:`_MAX_ACTIVE` outstanding, so nobody can ask
  for thousands and widen the guess space (the route adds per-IP lockout on top);
* **hashed at rest** — the file stores SHA-256, so reading `pair_codes.json` yields nothing
  redeemable;
* **constant-time compared**, and **fail-closed** on an unreadable store;
* **never logged, never returned twice** — the plaintext exists in one response body and in
  the operator's eyes.

**On telling "expired" apart from "invalid".** The pairing contract requires two distinct
rejections, because they need two different sentences in the UI ("that code has run out, get
a fresh one" is a different instruction from "check what you typed"). The oracle this creates
is that a caller learns a guessed code once existed — negligible against 32^8 over a 300s
window with at most five live, and only ever true for a record still sitting in the file,
since every write prunes expired ones. A shared "invalid" for both would trade a real
usability defect for an imaginary security gain.
