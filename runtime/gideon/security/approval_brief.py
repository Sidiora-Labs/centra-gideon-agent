"""The approval brief carried over the core↔channel seam (Contract C2,
`the plan (internal, not in this repo)`).

A channel (Slack, …) prompts the owner to approve a tool call through
:meth:`~gideon.channel_delivery.ChannelDelivery.request_approval`. Until this
module, the payload it received said WHAT tool wants to run but nothing about what
running it could TOUCH — the blast radius existed only in the dashboard, derived
frontend-side. This module composes the same brief backend-side and stamps it onto
the approval event as **additive meta**, so a phone notification can say the one
line that matters.

── What will run, as the dashboard's card shows it ──────────────────────────────
The brief also carries the call itself: the tool, its arguments and the purpose the
runner gave, each MASKED with :func:`~gideon.security.redact_field` — the mask the
dashboard's pending-approval entry applies to the same three strings — plus the one
``summary`` line (what the call can touch, and its risk). A channel renders its prompt
from these alone (:func:`approval_brief_for`), so every channel shows what the
dashboard's card shows and none has a masking pass of its own to get wrong. Three channels
used to show the tool's name and nothing else, and people approved a call they could not
see.

── This module DECIDES nothing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
It is descriptive. The approval gate, trust-reads and the task-mode gate live in
:mod:`gideon.task_modes` + :mod:`gideon.gateway` and are unchanged. The
classification here is CONSUMED from ``task_modes``, never re-derived: one reading of the
call (:func:`~gideon.task_modes.read_call`) gives both its effective risk and, for a
shell call, what its command establishes it does (``command_effects``). The risk and the
facets beside it therefore come from ONE analysis and cannot disagree. This module never
inspects a command string itself: reading a command is security logic and it already has an
owner.

── One derivation, every surface ────────────────────────────────────────────────
The dashboard's card, the out-of-context toast, the phone queue and every channel show the
blast radius composed HERE: :func:`call_blast_radius` runs where an approval is registered,
on the call's raw arguments, and the result travels with the approval (``blast_radius``) to
every surface. ``web/src/pages/chat/approvalMeta.ts`` holds the same facet WORDS and render
order for the dashboard to print, and ``tests/test_approval_brief.py`` parses that file and
asserts they still agree. A drift becomes a red test, not a second vocabulary.

For a shell call the facets are the command's: "writes files" for a redirect into a file or a
program run in a form that writes or deletes, "uses the network", "reads only" when every
program reads, and "runs a command" for any part the screen could not vouch for. For any
other call the hint lists DESCRIBE a change; they never establish a read. ``writes``,
``shell`` and ``network`` name what kind of thing a call that is not a read can touch, from
words in the tool's name, and a name is only ever evidence of what a tool might do.
``readOnly`` comes from the declaration alone, and a call it holds for claims no ``writes``.

── Honesty contract (identical to the frontend's) ───────────────────────────────
Every boolean is a POSITIVE claim: ``False`` means "not established", never
"verified absent". So :func:`derive_blast_radius` returns ``None`` when NOTHING was
established, rather than an all-false object — rendered as a line, all-false reads
"no writes, no network, no shell, not read-only", a confident all-clear derived from
zero evidence, and it is worst on the surface least able to check (the phone).
``read_only`` is claimed only on positive evidence — a declaration or a screened
command — so this module can only ever UNDER-claim safety.
