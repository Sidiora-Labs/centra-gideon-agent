"""The tmux substrate — the one place that knows how Gideon talks to tmux.

Why this is a module and not five private helpers in ``dashboard/handlers/terminal.py``:
tmux is now consulted by two unrelated callers with opposite jobs. P25 terminals *create*
sessions on our socket and reap their attach-clients; the boot recovery sweeps *interrogate*
that same socket to decide whether a run's work outlived the gateway. Two copies of "which
socket", "is tmux installed" and "what is a legal session name" is how the reaper and the
sweep end up disagreeing about whether a session exists — and the cost of that disagreement
is asymmetric: a sweep that guesses "dead" tombstones live work.

Three things live here and nowhere else:

* **The socket.** ``-L gideon`` is a dedicated tmux server, so nothing we do can see,
  adopt, or kill a session in the user's own tmux. Every command in this module passes it.
* **The names.** A durable session's name is derived from IDENTITY, never randomness, so a
  restarted gateway *recomputes* it and reattaches instead of reaping (EXECUTION-ISOLATION
  §5.1). ``terminal_session_name`` keeps P25's original mapping verbatim — it is a wire
  format, not an implementation detail: renaming it would orphan every session a running
  tmux daemon is already holding.
* **The probes.** Every call is best-effort and never raises. tmux absent, tmux hung, tmux
  answering garbage — all read as "no session", because the callers are a reaper and a boot
  sweep and neither may crash on a missing binary. Note the direction of that default:
  "no session" makes the sweep *more* conservative about claiming work survived, never less.
* **The spawn** (:func:`new_session`, EI-6's §5.1 SPAWN half). The one writer of durable
  sessions, so the reader above and the writer share a socket and a name discipline by
  construction. Same never-raises stance, opposite default: a spawn that cannot happen
  returns False and the caller runs the work as a bare subprocess — durability is an
  enhancement to a run, never a precondition for one.

Liveness semantics: ``has_session`` is the exit code of ``tmux has-session``, which is 0 only
while the daemon still holds the session. That is the real question — a session whose shell
exited is gone from the server, so this cannot report a dead worker as alive.
