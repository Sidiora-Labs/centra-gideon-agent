"""Abstract base for sandbox providers (EXECUTION-ISOLATION EI-1).

A **sandbox provider** owns the seam between "here is a command to launch" and "here is a
running child process", composing two host primitives that until now were called inline at
every spawn site (``acp/transport.py``):

* the OS-level filesystem sandbox (:func:`gideon.sandbox.wrap_argv` — macOS seatbelt /
  Linux user-namespace / none), which HIDES sensitive paths from an agent-influenced child; and
* the post-exec resource ceilings (:class:`gideon.sandbox.ResourceCeilings` delivered by
  the stdlib shim), which BOUND a child's open files / process count / address space.

The contract is deliberately two-phase — :meth:`SandboxProvider.wrap` produces a
:class:`SandboxHandle`, then :meth:`SandboxHandle.exec` launches it — so a caller can inspect
the wrapped argv before spawning, and a provider can own any temp state (a seatbelt profile, a
launcher script) that must be cleaned up AFTER the child exits (:meth:`SandboxHandle.cleanup`).

The in-core ``none`` provider (:mod:`gideon.sandbox_providers.none`) composes the two
existing primitives with no new isolation — it is the default and is behaviour-identical to the
inline logic it replaces. A stronger provider (a container/VM tier) is an installable ``sandbox``
app registering through :class:`gideon.providers.registry.SandboxTypeHandler`.

    ``"strict"`` (hide everything), or ``"off"`` (no OS sandbox).

    ``profile`` names the resource-ceiling profile applied by the post-exec shim
    (``tool``/``session_host``/``build``/``none`` — see :class:`ResourceCeilings`). It defaults
    to ``session_host`` because the first consumer is the ACP backend, which multiplexes many
    MCP stdio pipes and must not be OOM-biased.

    ``ceilings`` is an explicit :class:`ResourceCeilings`; ``None`` means "load from the live
    ``sandbox.*`` config at exec time" — the same fail-open-to-defaults behaviour a raw
    ``create_subprocess_limited`` has, so a broken config never blocks a spawn.
