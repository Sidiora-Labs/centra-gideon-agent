"""Abstract base for sandbox providers (EXECUTION-ISOLATION EI-1).

A **sandbox provider** owns the seam between "here is a command to launch" and "here is a
running child process", composing two host primitives that until now were called inline at
every spawn site (``acp/transport.py``):

* the OS-level filesystem sandbox (:func:`gideon.sandbox.wrap_argv` — macOS seatbelt /
  Linux user-namespace / none), which HIDES sensitive paths from an agent-influenced child; and
* the post-exec resource ceilings (:class:`gideon.sandbox.ResourceCeilings` delivered by
  the stdlib shim), which BOUND a child's open files / process count / address space.

The contract is deliberately two-phase — :meth:`SandboxProvider.wrap` produces a
:class:`SandboxHandle`, then :meth:`SandboxHandle.exec` launches it — so a caller can inspect
the wrapped argv before spawning, and a provider can own any temp state (a seatbelt profile, a
launcher script) that must be cleaned up AFTER the child exits (:meth:`SandboxHandle.cleanup`).

The in-core ``none`` provider (:mod:`gideon.sandbox_providers.none`) composes the two
existing primitives with no new isolation — it is the default and is behaviour-identical to the
inline logic it replaces. A stronger provider (a container/VM tier) is an installable ``sandbox``
app registering through :class:`gideon.providers.registry.SandboxTypeHandler`.

class SandboxSpec:
    """The isolation policy for one launch — pure data, no behaviour.

    ``mode`` is the :func:`gideon.sandbox.wrap_argv` level: ``"auto"``/``"standard"``
    (expose .aws/.ssh/.kube), ``"cc"`` (hide .aws, expose .aws/config for credential_process),
    ``"strict"`` (hide everything), or ``"off"`` (no OS sandbox).

    ``profile`` names the resource-ceiling profile applied by the post-exec shim
    (``tool``/``session_host``/``build``/``none`` — see :class:`ResourceCeilings`). It defaults
    to ``session_host`` because the first consumer is the ACP backend, which multiplexes many
    MCP stdio pipes and must not be OOM-biased.

    ``ceilings`` is an explicit :class:`ResourceCeilings`; ``None`` means "load from the live
    ``sandbox.*`` config at exec time" — the same fail-open-to-defaults behaviour a raw
    ``create_subprocess_limited`` has, so a broken config never blocks a spawn.

    The remaining fields are the **confinement policy** a container/VM tier (EI-2 ``docker``,
    EI-4 ``lima``) translates to its native knobs; the in-core ``none`` provider ignores them,
    so every existing caller that constructs ``SandboxSpec(mode=…, profile=…)`` is unchanged.

    * ``workspace_dir`` — the WORK-R3 worktree/scratch dir the tier bind-mounts. Empty means
      "use the launch ``cwd``" (what the live ACP/subagent consumer already passes to
      :meth:`SandboxHandle.exec`), so ``docker`` works with zero consumer changes.
    * ``allowed_write_paths`` — host paths (besides the workspace) the child may write. A tier
      mounts exactly these read-write; anything else is outside the boundary and a write to it
      fails because the path is not mounted.
    * ``egress_tier`` — ``off``/``listed``/``registry``/``all`` (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §4.2).
      ``off`` maps to ``--network none``; ``all`` leaves the default network. The finer tiers
      are advisory at the docker layer (host egress-rail allowlisting is net/policy scope).
    * ``env`` — the container's environment, already secret-filtered by WORK-R19. This is the
      ONLY environment the container receives; the host's environment is never copied in.
    * ``safety_profile`` — AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §3 profile name (drives the §5.2 tool surface).
    * ``expose_ports`` — container ports mapped to the host for the §6.2 localhost preview.
    * ``grant_paths`` — host paths explicitly granted into the sandbox (e.g. a model dir). NOT
      mounted unless listed, so an ungranted sandbox cannot see — let alone delete — them.
