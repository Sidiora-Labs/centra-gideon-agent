"""The ``docker`` sandbox provider (EXECUTION-ISOLATION EI-2).

The first *confinement* tier: where the ``none`` builtin (EI-1) only hides credential paths and
applies resource ceilings on the host, ``docker`` runs an agent-influenced process tree inside a
bind-mount container over its WORK-R3 worktree, so the isolation is a real filesystem +
process + (optional) network boundary rather than a seatbelt profile.

It is a ``bind_mount``-kind tier (sandcastle's taxonomy): the host owns the workspace and the
provider mounts it in — no copy-in/out sync. UID alignment uses ``--user <uid>:<gid>`` so files
written to the mount are owned by the host user with **no runtime ``chown -R``** (the permission
hazard the plan calls out); on Linux the mount carries an SELinux ``:z`` relabel. Resource
ceilings map to docker's native knobs — ``max_pids`` → ``--pids-limit`` (a fork bomb dies at
the limit, enforced by the container runtime on Linux and inside Docker Desktop's Linux VM on
macOS), ``max_rss_mb`` → ``--memory``. The workspace is the only writable host path unless
``allowed_write_paths``/``grant_paths`` add more, so a write outside the boundary fails because
the path was never mounted — and a model dir that was not granted cannot be deleted.

**Failure honesty (§1.1).** ``available()`` probes the docker CLI + daemon (cached). When Docker
is absent, :meth:`DockerSandboxProvider.wrap` raises :class:`SandboxUnavailableError` instead of
falling back to the host — the registry only fails open for an *unknown* name, and a caller that
asked for ``docker`` on a no-Docker machine must get a typed refusal (which an unattended run
parks needs-input on), never a silent host downgrade.

This tier is core-native (registered at boot beside ``none``), not an installable app; the app
provider type + ``SandboxTypeHandler`` seam stays for a future ``podman``/``byoi`` contribution.
