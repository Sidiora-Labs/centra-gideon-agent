"""Sandbox-internal tool gateway: zero listening ports, zero credentials inside (§5.2).

Memoh's answer to "a sandboxed agent still needs tools" is an in-container HTTP proxy on
127.0.0.1. Ours is stricter, and the difference is the whole point of this module:

* **Zero listening ports inside the sandbox.** The transport is the sandbox handle's own exec
  channel — a pipe pair the HOST created before the child existed. The shim (:mod:`pclaw_tool`)
  writes one JSON request line to its request fd and reads one JSON response line back. Nothing
  inside the sandbox can be connected TO: there is no socket to scan and no port-forward to
  misconfigure. A test asserts the shim's source imports no network module at all, because the
  property has to hold by construction rather than by policy.
* **Zero credentials inside.** The host authorises by construction — it created the channel, so
  possession of the fd *is* the authorisation. There is no shared secret to leak because there is
  no network hop to authenticate. The same trust basis as the internal ``X-Internal-Secret`` HTTP
  path (``messaging.py``), minus the secret. Tool results crossing into the sandbox are data;
  anything a tool touched host-side is redacted on the way out (:func:`gideon.security.redact`
  wraps the channel writer as defence in depth).
* **Policy at the HOST end.** The shim offers whatever the sandbox spec's safety profile allows
  and the host refuses the rest — a decision the sandbox cannot influence, because it is taken
  after the request arrives and before the tool is looked up. A research-class profile
  (``tool_grants="read"``) is refused every write-class tool.

🔴 **This is the first enforcement point for** ``SafetyProfile.tool_grants``. ``cli_run.py`` says
so plainly of the pre-existing tree: "that field has no enforcement point anywhere in the tree
today … so trusting it would have shipped a read-only promise that denies nothing." Enforcing it
HERE is safe precisely because this surface is new — no existing automation can be broken by a
control that had no call sites. And the classification is not a second dialect: the read/write
question is answered by :func:`gideon.task_modes.task_mode_denies`, the deny-by-default
classifier that is already the only read-only posture in this codebase that actually holds.
