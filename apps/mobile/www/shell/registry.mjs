/**
 * The shell's persisted gateway registry — the SAME contract `web/src/lib/endpoints.ts` declares.
 *
 * 🔑 THE FORMAT IS NOT OWNED HERE. `web/src/lib/endpoints.ts` owns it, and says so by name:
 * *"This module is what desktop (T4.1) and mobile import so that neither re-decides the key
 * format — two shells that disagree about the format are two shells that cannot share a
 * registry."* Before this file existed that module had **zero** production importers; the mobile
 * shell is its first consumer, and the shell storing a bespoke `gideon.gatewayUrl` instead
 * would have been the second registry contract it exists to prevent.
 *
 * 🪤 WHY THIS IS A PARITY RAIL AND NOT AN IMPORT. `endpoints.ts` is TypeScript inside the `web`
 * Vite bundle. This bootstrap is a plain ES module served from the shell's own local origin with
 * no bundler and no build step at all — so it cannot import that file, in the same way
 * `desktop/`'s shell-side modules cannot import core's Python. The repo's existing answer to that
 * shape is a vocabulary rail (`tests/test_desktop_seam.py`), so this file keeps its
 * implementation as small as possible and `tests/test_mobile_shell.py` asserts the storage key
 * and both field vocabularies still match `endpoints.ts` character for character. Anything
 * beyond one row — the switcher, per-endpoint storage namespacing, `endpointSocketUrl` — is
 * deliberately NOT reimplemented here; it belongs to whichever atom grows the shell to N
 * gateways, and it will grow it by importing `endpoints.ts` through a real build.
 *
 * 🚫 NO CREDENTIAL IS EVER STORED. `endpoints.ts` records why: *"The URL carries no credential:
 * the device session rides as the session cookie"* — `pair/complete` answers with an httponly
 * `Set-Cookie` (`pc_token_{port}`), so the session lives in the WebView's cookie jar where script
 * cannot read it, and the companion guide forbids a `?token=` query parameter because it IP-binds
 * and a phone changes IP. Everything in this file is a URL and a label.
