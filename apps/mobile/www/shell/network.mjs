/**
 * The one place that knows WHERE the companion lives and WHICH hosts the shell may reach.
 *
 * This module is the shell's whole reason to exist. The companion UI is **served** by the
 * gateway at `#/companion` (`web/src/app/App.tsx`) — the shell does not contain a copy of it,
 * a re-implementation of it, or a build of it. It computes one URL and hands the WebView to
 * it. If a future change makes this file import anything out of `web/`, the shell has stopped
 * being a wrapper and become a fork.
 *
 * **Why the gateway URL is runtime state and not a build constant.** Capacitor's canonical
 * "wrap a remote site" recipe is `server.url` in `capacitor.config.json`, which is baked at
 * build time. Every Gideon gateway lives at a different private address, so a baked URL
 * would mean one store build per user. The shell instead ships a tiny local bootstrap screen
 * whose only job is to learn the gateway origin once, remember it, and navigate away to it.
 *
 * **Why `allowNavigation` is a private-network rail and not `*`.** Capacitor keeps in-WebView
 * navigation to hosts on `server.allowNavigation` and kicks everything else to the system
 * browser. The companion is a LAN/tailnet surface, so the default list is exactly the private
 * ranges plus MagicDNS — a shell that cannot be steered onto a public phishing origin by a
 * link in rendered content. `capacitor.config.json` must carry every pattern below (asserted
 * by `tests/test_mobile_shell.py`); an operator fronting the gateway with a public reverse
 * proxy adds their own host to that list, deliberately, in a diff.

/**
 * Hostnames the shell may navigate to, as Capacitor `allowNavigation` globs (`*` = any run of
 * characters). RFC1918 is spelled out one `172.x` octet at a time because a glob cannot say
 * "16 through 31", and `172.*` would hand the shell most of a public /8.
 *
 * Tailscale is covered by `*.ts.net` (MagicDNS) rather than its 100.64/10 CGNAT range, for
 * the same reason: `100.*` would also match the public 100.0–100.63 space.
 *
 * Written out one literal at a time rather than generated with a loop, so that
 * `tests/test_mobile_shell.py` can compare this list against `capacitor.config.json` with a
 * dumb line scan — the Python suite parses this file, it does not execute node (the convention
 * `tests/test_desktop_seam.py` set). A generated list would need the rail to re-implement the
 * generator, which is how the two sides would come to disagree while both looking right.
