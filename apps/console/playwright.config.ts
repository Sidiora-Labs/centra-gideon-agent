// ── Playwright visual-regression + a11y harness ────────────────────────────
// The S2/S3 SAFETY RAIL for the design-system consistency plan: every
// consistency fix must show ZERO unintended visual diff against a captured
// baseline. Mirrors the gideon.dev pattern — @playwright/test +
// toHaveScreenshot with platform-qualified baselines (the -<platform> suffix
// keeps CI/mac/linux baselines separate so font/AA rendering diffs don't
// cause false failures).
//
// Baselines live in e2e/__screenshots__/ (committed). Regenerate a touched
// surface's baseline INTENTIONALLY with `npm run e2e:update` and record the
// change in the plan's Execution log for owner review — never silently keep
// or revert a real visual change.
//
// The servers: this harness drives the built SPA served by vite preview, which
// proxies /api to a gateway the harness STARTS ITSELF — isolated, onboarded and
// token-authenticated. Without a gateway the SPA cannot resolve identity, so it
// renders the ONBOARDING screen for every route: no NavRail, no shell, no ⌘K
// listener. axe then reports a clean tree for 96 surfaces it never actually
// visited, and the one test that noticed (`command palette [opened]`) failed on
// its mounted-ness floor while naming the palette instead of the missing backend.

// The harness's OWN gateway — never the real one on 10000. Fixed (not auto) so

// something else squats it, the gateway fails to bind and auth.setup's
// shell-mounted assertion fails loudly rather than scanning an empty app.

// ── The scripted provider contract — ONE place to reconcile ─────────────────
// Read off the committed modules, not guessed: `src/gideon/llm/scripted.py`
// owns SCRIPT_ENV_VAR / HOME_ENV_VAR and the version-1 script schema;
// `src/gideon/llm/registry.py` owns SCRIPTED_PROVIDER_TYPE and the env
// opt-in that REGISTERS the type. If a name drifts, fix THIS object — nothing
// else in the harness spells any of them out.
//
// `ScriptedProvider` is deterministic, makes ZERO network calls and needs NO
// credential. TWO locks, and both must hold or it refuses loudly:
//   · its script env var must name a readable script JSON file; and
//   · GIDEON_HOME must be set and must NOT resolve to the real
//     ~/.gideon — the provider refuses in a real home outright, re-checking
//     at both __init__ and start(). The gateway boot below already satisfies this
//     with its $TMPDIR home. Do not drop it.
//
// ONE env var, not two. `registry.py` gates REGISTRATION of the `scripted` type and
// `scripted.py` gates CONSTRUCTION of the provider, and both now read
// GIDEON_SCRIPTED_MODEL_SCRIPT — so the pair can never be half-enabled. The two
// modules briefly disagreed (the registry spelled it GIDEON_SCRIPTED_LLM while
// claiming it was "the SAME variable ScriptedProvider itself requires"), which is why
// `tests/test_scripted_provider_binding.py` now asserts the two constants are equal:
// nothing else could catch it, because `ignore_missing_imports` keeps mypy silent about
// a sibling module that does not exist yet.
//
// Script schema (version 1, validated STRICTLY — unknown keys at any level are an
// error, so a typo in the fixture fails the boot instead of scripting nothing):
//   { "version": 1, "on_exhausted": "repeat_last",
//     "turns": [ { "text": "…", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "usage": {…} } ] }
// The Nth prompt maps to the Nth turn. The fixture keeps `repeat_last` — the
// default, written out rather than left implicit — and NOT the stricter `error`,
// because one user turn drives more than one model call. Measured, not assumed: a
// green run logs `WARNING gideon.suggestions: Failed to parse suggestions
// response: SCRIPTED-E2E-OK…`, i.e. the follow-up-chips pass consumed a scripted
// reply of its own. Under `error` that second call would red this spec for a reason
// that is not its clause. `expect_prompt` is omitted for the same reason: those
// extra calls carry their own prompts, and their order against the user's turn is
// not deterministic.

// An ISOLATED, ONBOARDED gateway, with AUTH LEFT ON.
//  - GIDEON_HOME under the OS temp dir, wiped per run. Never ~/.gideon.
//  - GIDEON_WORKSPACE too: GIDEON_HOME does NOT confine workspace_dir,
//    which otherwise falls back to the real ~/workplace/gideon-workspace.
//  - `dashboard.user_name` pre-seeded into config.json, because `onboarded` is
//    DERIVED from a non-empty SERVER-side name (web/src/app/identity.tsx). Seeding
//    the file skips the onboarding hijack without a PUT — so no CSRF/origin dance,
//    and nothing here weakens a security control. "Keyur" matches the committed
//    visual baselines' greeting.
//  - NOT GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none: that swaps csrf_middleware for
//    _dev_user_middleware, so any a11y/CSRF-adjacent conclusion drawn under it
//    would not describe a real user. The token flow below is the real one.
//  - A MODEL, and still no credential and still no network: the two scripted-provider
//    env vars below. config.json stays EXACTLY as it was — a user name and nothing
//    else — on purpose: `registry.py`'s `register_scripted_provider_type()`
//    synthesizes its own entry ("Scripted"/scripted-1, credential=None) and registers
//    it BEFORE the config-derived ones so it wins the implicit
//    first-entry-declaring-the-capability fallback. So there is no `providers[]` entry
//    and no `active_models.json` pin to write here, and adding either would put a
//    second, competing entry of the same type in the registry. Nothing is weakened:
//    the home is still under $TMPDIR, still wiped per run, auth is still on, and
//    readiness is still the READY line.
