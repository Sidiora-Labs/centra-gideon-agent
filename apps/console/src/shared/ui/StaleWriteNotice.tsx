/** ── A save refused because the document changed elsewhere ────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  The one recovery every whole-document save offers (`lib/useStaleWriteGuard`). The gateway
 *  answered `409 stale_write`: another tab, another device, or Gideon itself saved since this
 *  page read the document, and saving this page's copy would have undone that. So nothing was
 *  written, and this says so — with the user's change KEPT until they choose:
 *
 *    · **Reload and reapply** — put their change back on top of what is stored now, and save that;
 *    · **Review the difference** — see what changed elsewhere and what their save would change;
 *    · **Discard my change** — keep what is stored.
 *
 *  When the change cannot be put back on its own — the other save changed the same part — there
 *  is no Reapply. Review says why, and offers to save theirs over it only from inside the review,
 *  where the user can see what that replaces.
 *
 *  🔑 AN ALERT. The user pressed Save and it did not save: that changes what the screen means, the
 *  same reason a failed save line is `role="alert"`. Painted as the failure band (`InlineError`).
 *
 *  🔴 AND BROUGHT TO THE USER WHEN IT APPEARS. On a long form it rendered below the fold — measured
 *  at y=2114 in a 1000px window on the prompt editor, 1200px under the sticky Save bar — and the only
 *  sign on screen that the save had not happened was Save turning grey, with focus dropped to
 *  `<body>`. It scrolls just far enough to be seen (with room for a sticky bar above or below) and
 *  takes focus, as `FormFooter` does for its own refusal, so a keyboard user lands on the choice.
