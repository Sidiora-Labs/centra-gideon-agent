/** ── A save from a stale page is refused, never an overwrite ──────────────────────────────
 *
 *  A surface that saves a WHOLE list or document builds it from the copy it read. When another
 *  tab — or the gateway itself — saved since, that copy is stale, and replacing the stored value
 *  with it erased the other change without a word. Each write was fine on its own; the loss lived
 *  in the gap between this page's read and its save.
 *
 *  The gateway's half is `gideon/stale_write.py`: every read of such a document carries its
 *  `revision`, every whole-document write names the revision it was built from in `If-Match`, and a
 *  stale one is refused with `409 stale_write` before anything is written. This module is the
 *  client's half, used the same way on every surface:
 *
 *    · a read keeps the document AND its revision together — `Revisioned<T>` — because a revision
 *      taken from a different read than the value it guards would guard the wrong copy;
 *    · a write sends `basedOn(revision)`;
 *    · a refusal is `isStaleWrite(e)`, and `useStaleWriteGuard` turns it into the one recovery the
 *      whole app offers: keep what the user was saving, say the document changed elsewhere, and
 *      offer to reload and re-apply the change, or to review the difference first.
 *
 *  Re-applying needs the change as something that can be put back on top of what is stored NOW.
 *  A list edit is an operation (`add this rule`), so it is its own `Rebase`. A text or a record edit
 *  is a three-way merge against the copy it started from (`mergeText`, `mergeRecord`); when both
 *  sides changed the same part it returns `null`, and the page says so instead of choosing.
 *
 *  This module deliberately does not import `api.ts` (which imports it): a refusal is recognised by
 *  shape, as `securityConsent.ts` recognises its own. */
