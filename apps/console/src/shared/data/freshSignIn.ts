/** A write that needs a recent sign-in: the owner is asked to sign in again, once, here, for every
 *  surface — and then the write is sent again, so what they asked for carries on.
 *
 *  🔑 THE GATEWAY DECIDES WHICH WRITES NEED ONE, NOT THIS FILE (`dashboard/owner_presence.py`):
 *  minting a credential (a device pairing code, a device sign-in code, an integration token, a
 *  channel owner's code), setting the first password, and making sign-in less strict. Sent from a
 *  device that signed in more than ten minutes ago, such a write is answered
 *  `401 fresh_sign_in_required`, with the gateway's sentence and what to ask for in `error.detail`:
 *  `password` (this gateway offers password sign-in) and `second_factor` (an authenticator code is
 *  set up). Every write in `api.ts` goes through `withFreshSignIn`, so a surface never predicts it.
 *  The desktop app's own window is never asked: it signs itself in.
 *
 *  Signing in again is either the password (`POST /api/auth/confirm`, which replaces this device's
 *  sign-in with a new one) or, where password sign-in is off, a new link from `gideon token`
 *  pasted here, which this page opens in place (a `?token=` request, the exchange a link opened in
 *  the address bar makes), so the page and what was typed into it stay put.
 *
 *  The answer is not a sign-out (it carries no `X-Auth-Required`), and neither is a refused
 *  password or link here: those are read with plain `fetch`, never `api.ts`'s error builder, which
 *  would take a refused link for this tab being signed out. This module does not import `api.ts`,
 *  which imports it: the answer is recognised by shape. */
