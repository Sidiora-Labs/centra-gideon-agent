// ── #624: a REFUSED inbox setting rolls back, in BOTH copies ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Retention accepted -5/0/1.5/99999, showed each as saved, and never reported the server's 400 —
// and after the notify was added, the optimistic merge STILL stood: the field kept showing the
// refused value until a reload silently restored the stored one. `settingsWriteReported`'s
// doctrine names this the one unsanctioned shape ("keeping a refused value is not"), with the
// pre-patch rollback as the sanctioned form for a panel that owns its own state — the exact shape
// `setEngagement` uses in the same file.
//
// One test per copy (the drawer panel and the settings-page panel), because the two are separate
// files kept in field-parity by `inboxSettingsParity.test.ts` — a fix landing in only one is the
// drift that suite exists to catch, so this rail exercises each independently.

const notified: string[] = []
// Event-driven settlement: `notifyArrived` resolves the moment the panel calls
// notify(), so the assertion needs no poll loop. Two rounds of budget-raising on
// the polled form (1s default, then 4s) both starved under CI suite contention —
// waitFor samples on an interval, and a starved worker can miss every sample
// window inside any fixed budget. An awaited event has no sample window to miss;
// the generous test-level timeout below only bounds the true-regression case
// (notify never called at all).
