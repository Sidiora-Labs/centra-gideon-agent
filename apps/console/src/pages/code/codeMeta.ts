/** The delete-confirmation body for a Code project.
 *
 *  🔴 IT LIVED IN TWO PLACES AND BOTH WERE WRONG THE SAME WAY. `CodeSection` and `CodeCockpitPage` each
 *  built this string from a byte-identical template, and both said — for a project with a bound
 *  workspace — *"Your workspace folder and its files are left untouched."*
 *
 *  🪤 THE SAME PREDICATE THAT SELECTED THAT REASSURANCE ARMED THE DESTRUCTION. The copy branched on
 *  `p.workspace_dir`; `loop/manager.py` runs the teardown under
 *  `if loop is not None and (loop.workspace_dir or "").strip():` → `worktree.cleanup_all(…)` →
 *  `worktree.py`'s `git worktree remove --force` **and `git branch -D`**, executed with the user's
 *  workspace as cwd. So exactly when the dialog promised safety, Gideon force-deleted branches
 *  from the user's repository.
 *
 *  🔑 THE PRECISE TRUTH, because this correction is worth getting exactly right rather than merely
 *  scarier: `_worktrees_root` puts the task worktrees under `config_dir()`, **not** inside the user's
 *  folder — so the working tree and its files genuinely ARE untouched, and that clause survives. What is
 *  false is the *repository*: every `gideon/task-*` branch is force-deleted, taking any commit made on one
 *  and never merged. Merged work is on the user's own branch and is safe. Recovery is `git reflog` /
 *  `git fsck --lost-found` before gc — forensics, not a product path.
 *
 *  🪤 AND "removes its plan" UNDERSTATED THE REST. `manager.py` also calls `tasks_link.teardown_tasks`,
 *  which deletes every task across the loop's per-phase lists. Tasks are a first-class surface here —
 *  the cockpit renders a whole right-rail Tasks panel over `task_list_ids` — and they survive stop,
 *  complete and fail, dying only on delete (`manager.py`'s own docstring draws that line). So the dialog
 *  named the smallest of the three losses.
 *
 *  🪤 ROOT CAUSE, WORTH REMEMBERING: both call sites' comments reasoned carefully about `store.delete`'s
 *  `rmtree` of the loop's own managed folder — the INNER function, whose contract they described
 *  correctly. The OUTER handler runs `teardown_for_delete` first, and that is what reaches into the
 *  user's repo. **Copy written against a callee goes stale the first time a caller does more.** Hoisting
 *  it here is the structural half of the fix: one sentence, one place, verified against the handler.
 */
/** Structural on purpose: the two call sites hold different records (`Loop` in the list,
 *  `CodeProject` in the cockpit) and this needs three fields from either. `workspace_dir` is optional
 *  in BOTH — which is the whole branch condition, so typing it as required would have been a lie that
 *  `tsc` caught immediately. */
