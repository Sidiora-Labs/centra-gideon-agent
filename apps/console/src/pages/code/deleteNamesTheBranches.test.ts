/** Deleting a Code project force-deletes branches in the user's repo, and the dialog promised safety.
 *
 * Both `CodeSection` and `CodeCockpitPage` built a byte-identical confirmation body which said, for a
 * project with a bound workspace:
 *
 *     "Your workspace folder and its files are left untouched."
 *
 * 🪤 THE SAME PREDICATE SELECTED THAT REASSURANCE AND ARMED THE DESTRUCTION. The copy branched on
 * `p.workspace_dir`. `loop/manager.py` runs the teardown under
 * `if loop is not None and (loop.workspace_dir or "").strip():` → `worktree.cleanup_all(…)` →
 * `worktree.py`'s `git worktree remove --force` **and `git branch -D`**, executed with the user's
 * workspace as cwd. Exactly when the dialog promised safety, Gideon deleted branches from the
 * user's repository.
 *
 * 🔑 THE PRECISE TRUTH, because a correction is only worth making if it is exact rather than merely
 * scarier. `_worktrees_root` puts the task worktrees under `config_dir()`, **not** inside the user's
 * folder — so the working tree and its files genuinely ARE untouched, and that clause survives. What was
 * false is the *repository*: every `gideon/task-*` branch is force-deleted, taking any commit made on one
 * and never merged. Merged work sits on the user's own branch and is safe. Recovery is
 * `git reflog` / `git fsck --lost-found` before gc — forensics, not a product path.
 *
 * 🪤 AND "removes its plan" UNDERSTATED THE REST: `manager.py` also calls `tasks_link.teardown_tasks`,
 * deleting every task across the loop's per-phase lists. `manager.py`'s own docstring draws the line —
 * tasks survive stop, complete and fail, and die only on delete — and the cockpit renders a whole
 * right-rail Tasks panel over them. The dialog named the smallest of the three losses.
 *
 * 🪤 ROOT CAUSE: both call sites' comments reasoned about `store.delete`'s `rmtree` of the loop's own
 * managed folder — the INNER function, described correctly. The OUTER handler runs `teardown_for_delete`
 * first. **Copy written against a callee goes stale the first time a caller does more** — the third
 * instance of that exact shape found in this campaign, after the project-delete dialog and the rail that
 * certified it. The duplication is why it survived: two copies, neither anchored to the handler.
 *
 * 🔑 The same page ALREADY told the truth on Stop — "a task still running loses its own worktree and
 * branch" — while Delete, which does strictly more, denied it. A rail below pins that, because the
 * honest sentence existing 100 lines away is the strongest evidence the dialog could have been right.
