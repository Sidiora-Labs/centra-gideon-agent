// ── The empty-state hints that promise an automatic future, pinned to the mechanism ─────────────
//
// #1631 found one of these lying: the routing panel promised three axes would "fill in" when only one
// can. That prompted checking the rest of the family, and **the other three are TRUE** — which is worth
// a test rather than a shrug, because each is a claim about a mechanism that could be descoped,
// disabled-by-default, or quietly unwired later. A hint saying "it fills in as…" is the same shape as an
// inert control: it costs the user a wait instead of a click.
//
// Verified here, each by the thing that would falsify it:
//
//   DurabilityPanel  "One appears after the first nightly run"  → `durability.auto_backup` defaults to
//                    True AND the loop's `enabled()` fails SAFE to True, so the nightly job runs on a
//                    default install. (Drills and sync each have their own gate; the snapshot does not.)
//   FeedbackPanel    "👍/👎 appear on inbox classifications, drafted replies, digests, and loop
//                    findings" → all four target kinds really are rendered.
//   MemoryPanel      digests "build on the maintenance cadence, or press Build / refresh above" → the
//                    builder is called from the consolidation cadence AND from the endpoint the button
//                    hits with `?rebuild=1`.
