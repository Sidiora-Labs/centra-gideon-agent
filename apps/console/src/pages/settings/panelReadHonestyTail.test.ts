// ── The last three settings panels whose failed read said nothing ─────────────────────────────
//
// Cycle 124 fixed the `gideonConfig` family and left ~51 substituting readers with the rule: only
// worth a cycle where a substituted value decides what a CONTROL claims. Re-censused the 53 with that
// exact test — does the panel WRITE (patch/save/PUT), does it render editable controls, and does it read
// `error`? — and three came back positive. Driven at 500 with an intercept COUNTER, because a
// non-matching route pattern looks exactly like a clean result (it cost two wrong readings first: the
// real path is `/api/models/use-cases/<x>/settings`, not `/api/use-case-settings`):
//
//   panel                    intercepted   before                              after
//   #/settings/notifications      4        0 controls · 1 `aria-busy` skeleton  the alert + Retry
//                                          · **shimmering forever**, silent
//   #/settings/updates            2        same                                the alert + Retry
//   #/settings/voice              6        **2 switches + 1 input** from a      the alert + Retry
//                                          fabricated `{}`, silent
//
// 🔑 TWO SHAPES, ONE FAMILY. A substituted `null` is indistinguishable from "still loading" to a
// `if (!data) return <FormSkeleton/>` gate, so the panel shimmers forever (cycle 117's inbox shape); a
// substituted `{}` passes the gate and renders the form from fallbacks (cycle 124's shape). Same cause —
// the rejection never reached the hook — and the same fix: let it reach, branch on it first.
//
// 🔑 EVERY VOICE CONTROL PUTs ON CHANGE, so its version is the integrity one: a user "correcting" a switch
// that was never loaded writes the opposite of what they believe is stored.
//
// 🔑 WHAT KEEPS ITS FALLBACK, AND WHY — the decorating reads. `notificationRules` (a per-kind policy table
// BELOW the settings), `changelog` (a section further down), `modelsActive` (a readiness chip). Losing one
// degrades a section; losing the gating read fabricates the panel.
