// ── A settings write that fails must say so ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every settings toggle in this app saves OPTIMISTICALLY: the local state flips first, then the PUT
// goes out. That is the right feel — and it makes a swallowed rejection a lie, because the control is
// left showing a value the server refused.
//
// Measured on `#/settings/chat` with the PUT returning 500 (route-intercepted, so nothing was written):
//
//   toggle `aria-pressed`  false → true, and it STAYED true
//   "Saved" confirmation   never appeared (correct — it is `.then`-only)
//   live-region content    []            ← nothing was announced
//   page text              no error anywhere
//
// A reload silently reverts it. The app already answers this everywhere else: eight sibling handlers in
// `AccountPanel`, `AmbientPanel` and `AgentDefaultsPanel` do
// `notify(\`Couldn't save …: ${message}\`, 'error')`. Five handlers did not, all with the same
// optimistic-then-silent shape, and this rail keeps them converged:
//
//   settings/ChatPanel.tsx           saveDashboardConfig   (Sessions + Messages sections)
//   settings/InboxSettingsPanel.tsx  saveInboxSettings
//   settings/MemoryPanel.tsx         saveMemorySettings
//   settings/NotificationsPanel.tsx  saveNotificationSettings
//   inbox/InboxSettingsPanel.tsx     saveInboxSettings     (the drawer copy — kept in parity)
//
// After: the same probe reports `Couldn't save this chat setting: {"detail":"save failed"}` and
// `Couldn't save your notification settings: …` in a live region.
//
// ⚠️ The probe's own `saysError` heuristic (regex over `document.body.innerText`) FALSE-POSITIVED on
// `#/settings/notifications`, whose static copy contains the word "failed". Only the live-region content
// is trustworthy for "was the user told?".

  // 🪤 THIS RAIL USED TO FILTER BY VERB NAME — `api.save*` and `api.patchConfig` — and therefore could not
  // see the two writes it was written for. `UpdatesPanel`'s `setAutoUpdate` / `setUpdateDevMode` flipped
  // local state, showed "Saved" on `.then` only, and discarded the rejection: the exact defect described in
  // this file's header, invisible for four cycles because it is spelled `set*`.
  //
  // **A rail that filters by verb misses every future verb.** So the sweep now matches the SHAPE — any
  // `api.<anything>(` whose chain discards the rejection — and every legitimate swallow is named below with
  // its reason. That inverts the default: a new swallowed write fails this test unless someone deliberately
  // adds it to the allowlist, which is the only version of this rail that can stay true.
