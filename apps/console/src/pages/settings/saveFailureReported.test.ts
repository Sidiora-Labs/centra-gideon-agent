// ── A settings write that fails must say so ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every settings toggle in this app saves OPTIMISTICALLY: the local state flips first, then the PUT
// goes out. That is the right feel — and it makes a swallowed rejection a lie, because the control is
// left showing a value the server refused.
//
// Measured on `#/settings/chat` with the PUT returning 500 (route-intercepted, so nothing was written):
//
//   toggle `aria-pressed`  false → true, and it STAYED true
//   "Saved" confirmation   never appeared (correct — it is `.then`-only)
//   live-region content    []            ← nothing was announced
//   page text              no error anywhere
//
// A reload silently reverts it. The app already answers this everywhere else: eight sibling handlers in
// `AccountPanel`, `AmbientPanel` and `AgentDefaultsPanel` do
// `notify(\`Couldn't save …: ${message}\`, 'error')`. Five handlers did not, all with the same
// optimistic-then-silent shape, and this rail keeps them converged:
//
//   settings/ChatPanel.tsx           saveDashboardConfig   (Sessions + Messages sections)
//   settings/InboxSettingsPanel.tsx  saveInboxSettings
//   settings/MemoryPanel.tsx         saveMemorySettings
//   settings/NotificationsPanel.tsx  saveNotificationSettings
//   inbox/InboxSettingsPanel.tsx     saveInboxSettings     (the drawer copy — kept in parity)
//
// After: the same probe reports `Couldn't save this chat setting: {"detail":"save failed"}` and
// `Couldn't save your notification settings: …` in a live region.
//
// ⚠️ The probe's own `saysError` heuristic (regex over `document.body.innerText`) FALSE-POSITIVED on
// `#/settings/notifications`, whose static copy contains the word "failed". Only the live-region content
// is trustworthy for "was the user told?".

//
// The sweep above asks one question: *is the rejection discarded?* `#/settings/portability` answered
// **no** — it captured every rejection and rendered the message. Measured with `/api/durability/export`
// route-intercepted to a 500:
//
//   the message            "Packaging failed: no space left on device"   ← a good message
//   the button that failed y = 249   ("Export knowledge")
//   where it rendered      y = 493   — **244px below**, and below the "Import" heading at y = 379
//   its DOM ancestry       span.text-on-surface-low → div.mt-3.flex → div.rounded-lg.border-warn/30
//                          → i.e. INSIDE THE IMPORT CARD, in the Import button's own row
//   its voice              rgb(154,155,156), 12px, role=null, no aria-live ancestor
//   the same action's SUCCESS   a toast (`notify(…, 'success')`)
//
// So one button reported success as a toast and failure as 12px grey text in a different section, under a
// notice that begins "Importing merges the archive's data…". A user who clicks Export and gets nothing
// looks at the button; if they ever find the sentence, it appears to be about importing.
//
// 🔑 THE CAUSE WAS THE VARIABLE, NOT THE SPAN. A single `msg` state was written by all three handlers
// (export, validate, import) and rendered at one site inside the Import card. Moving the span would have
// fixed one of the three. Failures now go to the error channel — `notify(…, 'error')`, which is where the
// other **61** failure reports across these panels go, and exactly what the sibling `DurabilityPanel`
// does for the same `/api/durability/*` endpoints — and the state was renamed `importResult`, so a catch
// has nothing left to write to. That is the guard: not a convention, an absence.
//
// 🔑 THE FAMILY IS 6 MORE, MEASURED, AND MOST OF IT MAY BE FINE. An inline `setErr` beside the control
// that failed is a GOOD report — often better than a toast. What made this one a defect was the distance
// plus the shared channel. The census below is therefore a ceiling on "a message-shaped failure state
// whose render sites carry no error tone", not a to-do list: 7 before this change, **6 after**, and the
// panel this cycle fixed must no longer appear in it. That drop is also the vacuity proof — a census that
// does not shrink when you fix a member was never measuring the member.
