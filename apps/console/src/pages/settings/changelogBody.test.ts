// ── The panel told the reader how the panel works ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `/api/changelog` serves CHANGELOG.md verbatim — **255,413 characters** — and `#/settings/updates`
// rendered all of it inside a card already headed "Changelog · What's changed recently". Measured from
// the live DOM, the first four blocks in that card were:
//
//   H1  "Changelog"                                     ← a SECOND <h1>, nested inside an <h2> section
//   P   "All notable changes to Gideon are recorded here. The format follows Keep a Changelog…"
//   P   "The in-app Updates panel reads this file (`GET /api/changelog`) to show \"what's new.\""
//   H2  "Unreleased"                                    ← a SIBLING of the panel's own sections
//
// So: the title duplicated 30px below itself, a note about the file format, and a sentence explaining
// to the user how the surface they are looking at is implemented. The document's front matter is
// written for CONTRIBUTORS; the endpoint is right to serve the file whole, and deciding what "what's
// changed recently" means is the panel's job.
//
// Page heading census, before → after: **h1 × 2 ("Updates", "Changelog") → h1 × 1**, and the outline
// becomes h1 Updates › h2 Changelog › h3 Unreleased › h4 Added instead of putting a release on the same
// rung as the page's own furniture.
//
// 🔑 WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, on purpose: it does not cap the history. 1,992 DOM nodes and 43,947px of
// scroll in a 384px box is 80% of the page's total nodes — real, and a cap is a product decision (how
// many releases, and where "the rest" lives), so it is logged rather than guessed at here.
