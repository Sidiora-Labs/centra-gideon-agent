// ── A settings panel may not present fabricated values as saved state ────────────
//
// Four panels read their section of the config with
// `api.gideonConfig().then(c => (c.<section> ?? {})).catch(() => ({}))`. The catch made a FAILED
// read resolve with an empty section, so every control rendered at its fallback — indistinguishable from
// "this is what you saved" — and the panel offered to edit values it had never loaded.
//
// Measured with `GET /api/config` at 500 and a cold sessionStorage, counting editable controls on the page:
//
//   route                    before                          after
//   #/settings/agent         9 editable controls, no error    0 controls · "Couldn't load your settings" + Retry
//   #/settings/ambient       6                                0 · same
//   #/settings/guardrails    6                                0 · same
//   #/settings/legibility    2                                0 · same
//
// 🔑 The load-bearing half is not the copy — it is that the FORM IS GONE. Cycle 91's lesson on the
// incident kill switch applies to every settings form: ask what a swallowed read lets the user DO. Here it
// let them "change" a setting whose current value was unknown.
//
// Out of scope on purpose (different shapes, each needing its own measurement): panels whose reads
// substitute `null` and already branch on it (`ChatPanel`, `DurabilityPanel`, `FeedbackPanel`,
// `InboxSettingsPanel`, `MemoryPanel`), and `AppsPanel`, whose `'apps'` key was fixed by the cache-key
// sweep instead.
