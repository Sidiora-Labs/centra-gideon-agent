// ── SH-10 · the Security panel says WHICH denylist is in force, and whether it drifted ──────
//
// `/api/security/denied-commands` used to return two bare arrays, so the panel could show 112
// patterns without being able to say where they came from, whether they still matched what
// shipped, or how many of the user's own entries actually changed anything. It now carries a
// `baseline` block (version, sha256, enforced count, `verified`) and `user_additions`.
//
// 🔑 THREE CLAUSES HERE ARE TRIVIAL TO FAKE, so each is pinned against the fake:
//
//   • "a tamper fixture flips the indicator" — a hardcoded green chip reads identically on the
//     happy path. The diverged fixture asserts the ROLE and the copy both change.
//   • "'N user additions' shown" — `user.length` is the obvious implementation and it is wrong:
//     the server dedupes an entry equal to a built-in, so a 3-entry config can add ONE pattern.
//   • "read-only" — asserted as the ABSENCE of any control inside the baseline region, measured
//     by role, not by reading the JSX.
//
// 🪤 COLD sessionStorage per test. `useQuery(..., { persist: true })` seeds from
// sessionStorage, and the settings hub writes a substituted `null` under the SAME
// `settings:security` key — a warm cache masks both the failure branch and the fresh payload.
//
// 🔑 THE WORDING IS PART OF THE FEATURE. The chip says the baseline "matches what shipped", never
// "tamper-proof" or "secure": the digest is anti-drift and anti-LLM-tamper, not anti-owner
// (docs/security/threat-model.md). The last test pins that, because an enthusiastic copy edit to
// "verified secure" would be a claim the mechanism cannot support.
