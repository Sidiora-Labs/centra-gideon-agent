/** Documents — how generated Word/Excel/PowerPoint files behave in the app.

 *  One control today: whether an office document can be edited IN PLACE, or stays
 *  download-only. It is off by default and deliberately blunt about why, because saying
 *  yes accepts a real trade: Gideon re-creates the file from the structure it could
 *  parse, so anything its document model cannot hold is not in the saved copy. The editor
 *  names those constructs before the first edit and again in the save confirmation, and
 *  the pre-edit version stays restorable — but the honest place to describe the trade is
 *  here, where the consent is given. */
