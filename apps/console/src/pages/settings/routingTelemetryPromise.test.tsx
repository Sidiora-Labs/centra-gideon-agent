// ── An empty state must not promise data that cannot arrive ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// `RoutingPanel` offers three axes — Chat (the DEFAULT), Code & tools, Reasoning — and told all three
// "it fills in as models handle this kind of request". Traced through the backend, only one of them can
// ever fill:
//
//   routing stats are folded in `ModelCallGuard._audit` → the guard is applied by `provider_bridge`
//   only when `_guard_use_case` is set → which happens for exactly
//   ("reasoning", "background", "loops", "orchestration").
//
// The bridge says why in its own comment: "The interactive chat/code_tools stream stays OUT OF SCOPE …
// both human-watched". So a fresh install lands on Chat and waits forever. This is the inert-promise
// shape — the mechanism is fine and deliberate; the COPY was the defect.
//
// The tabs are deliberately left alone (mirroring the Models panel's axes is a stated choice, and
// removing two of them is a product decision) — filed as an owner taste call instead.
