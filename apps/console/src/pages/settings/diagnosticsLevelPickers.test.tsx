// ── Two identical-looking pickers, one of which writes a persistent setting ───────────────────────
//
// `#/settings/diagnostics` renders two one-of-N pill groups whose visible text was byte-identical:
//
//   Backend log level   DEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR   Current: WARNING     ← WRITES a backend setting,
//                                                                          persisted across restarts
//   Live logs toolbar   DEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR                        ← filters what is on SCREEN
//
// Their accessible names already distinguished them — `Backend log level: DEBUG` versus
// `Show DEBUG and above`, added by an earlier cycle whose own comment says "the two dimensions are
// genuinely different … which is exactly why each needs to say which one it is". It said it in the
// accessibility tree only. **So the one reader who could tell a persistent backend write from a local
// view filter was the one using a screen reader**, and a sighted user had to infer it from position.
// This file pins both halves: the names stay distinct, and the visible surface says it too.
//
// 🪤 THE CLAIM I COULD NOT SUBSTANTIATE, recorded so the next cycle does not re-derive it. The view
// filter can be set to DEBUG while the backend logger is at WARNING, and reading the code that looks
// like a dead end (a logging handler only receives what the logger's level admits, and the SSE stream
// attaches its handler to the `gideon` logger). Driving it did NOT confirm a user-visible
// consequence: at backend=WARNING the panel still showed an INFO line, because `/api/logs` replays a
// ring buffer captured before the level changed — and an idle gateway emits no DEBUG records at either
// level, so 2 lines became 3. A note reading "the backend is not emitting these" would therefore be
// asserting a mechanism the surface does not demonstrate. Left unfixed on purpose.
