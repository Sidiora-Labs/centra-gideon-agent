/** The five runtime-editable `evals.*` fields — the FIFTH point of the config
 *  round-trip contract, which was the only one missing.
 *
 *  Measured before this: `evals.*` had a dataclass + `_meta`, a `load()`, a `to_dict()` and five
 *  entries in `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` (`dashboard/handlers/core.py`), and **zero** frontend controls —
 *  `git grep -in evals -- web/src/pages/settings` returned nothing across 33 subpages. Meanwhile
 *  `#/learning` told four panels' worth of users to turn the substrate on, and the only path that
 *  existed was `gideon config set`. A backend allowlist with no control is a feature only its
 *  author can reach.
 *
 *  🔑 EVERY LABEL AND HINT BELOW IS THE FIELD'S OWN `_meta`, VERBATIM. `EvalsConfig` in
 *  `config/loader.py` already carries the sentence the owner wrote for each knob, so inventing a
 *  second wording here would mean two answers to "what does this do" — and the one the CLI prints
 *  (`gideon config get --describe`) would not be the one the UI shows. `evalsCopy.test.ts`
 *  reads `loader.py` and fails if any string here drifts from it. The one addition is the cost
 *  sentence on the switch, marked below, because `_meta` describes the FIELD and this row has to
 *  describe the *decision* — see `COST_OF_TURNING_IT_ON`.
 *
 *  🪤 `evals.bakeoff_capture_enabled` IS NOT HERE, and its absence is the point. It is a
 *  privacy-sensitive input-capture flag deliberately kept OUT of `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` (the
 *  `inbound.mcp.allow_remote` precedent), so a control for it would PATCH a path the backend
 *  refuses — a switch that flips, 400s, and rolls back. Surfacing exactly what the allowlist
 *  permits is what makes this panel honest; `evalsRoundTrip.test.ts` pins both directions.
 *
 *  Ranges are the allowlist's own `min`/`max`. A stepper that let you pick a value the PATCH
 *  refuses is the same defect as a control for a non-allowlisted key, one layer down. */
type EvalsCfg = Record<string, unknown>

/** The sentence `_meta` cannot carry, because `_meta` describes a field and this describes a
 *  decision: the switch itself spends nothing, and everything it unlocks spends model calls.
 *
 *  It says "judge" specifically because that is the cost a reader will not predict. A study's own
 *  runs are obviously runs; the position-swapped LLM judge behind every pair is the half people
 *  discover from a bill. `judge_agreement_floor` below is the knob that exists BECAUSE the judge is
 *  a model and can be wrong — so the two rows explain each other, and this is the row that has to
 *  say it first.
 *
 *  Kept to ONE sentence on purpose: with the `_meta` help above it this row is already the tallest
 *  in settings, and at 390px `Row` centres the switch against the hint — so every clause costs
 *  vertical distance between the control and its own label. Measured: the first draft ran to 456
 *  characters and put the switch 200px below "Evals enabled" on a 390px viewport. */
