// ── Thirteen switches and ten inputs showing settings nobody saved ──────────────────────────
//
// `AgentDefaultsPanel` already carries the ruling, comment and all: **a settings panel must not present
// FABRICATED values as saved state.** Its siblings that read the SAME endpoint had not been converged.
// Censused `pages/settings` for readers that substitute a value on rejection — **55** of them — and
// narrowed to the family where the substitution decides what a CONTROL claims: panels whose
// `api.gideonConfig()` read is the panel.
//
// Driven at 1440×900 with `/api/config/gideon` at 500 and a cold sessionStorage, measured against
// the PARENT worktree (`grep -c 'gideonConfig().catch'` = 1 there, 0 here — the only way to know
// which tree a dev server is serving):
//
//                            before                              after
//   #/settings/chat          **10 switches + 6 inputs**, silent   0 · 0 · "Couldn't load your settings" + Retry
//   #/settings/durability    **2 switches + 3 inputs**, silent    0 · 0 · same
//   #/settings/packs         **1 switch + 1 input**, silent       0 · 0 · same
//   #/settings/agent         already correct                      unchanged  ← control
//
// 🔑 EVERY ONE OF THOSE CONTROLS PATCHes ON CHANGE, so the failure mode is not merely a wrong readout: a
// user "correcting" a switch that was never loaded writes the opposite of what they believe is stored.
//
// 🔴 AND ONE PANEL'S EXISTING FIX WAS INERT ON THE REAL JOURNEY. `#/settings/legibility` refuses
// fabricated values — but the hub tile shares its cache key, so opening `#/settings` first primed it:
//
//   direct to the panel   cache=null   → the alert          ✅ its own fix works
//   hub → the panel       cache="{}"   → **2 switches, no alert**   🔴 defeated
//   after                 cache=null   → the alert, both ways
//
// Same key-poisoning shape cycle 117 found for `apps` / `settings:archives` /
// `settings:projection-rules`. **A per-surface honesty fix is not done until every consumer of its cache
// key stops substituting** — and the hub is a consumer of eleven of them.
//
// 🔑 WHAT KEEPS ITS FALLBACK, AND WHY: reads that DECORATE rather than define. `dashboardConfig` (the
// starter list), `durabilityStatus` + `durabilitySnapshots` (a status strip and a list), `api.agents()`
// in AgentDefaults. Losing one of those degrades a section; losing the config fabricates the panel.
