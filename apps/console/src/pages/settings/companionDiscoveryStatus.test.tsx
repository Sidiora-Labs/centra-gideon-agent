// ── A toggle whose effect is invisible from the machine you set it on ──────────────────────────────
//
// `companion.discovery_enabled` (CA-4) asks the gateway to advertise itself on the LAN. The backend
// (CA-5) deliberately REFUSES on a loopback-only bind: announcing 127.0.0.1 publishes an address that
// resolves, on every other device, to that device. So "enabled" and "advertising" are two states, and
// the designed case — on, and correctly doing nothing — is the one a flag-only panel gets wrong.
//
// 🪤 THE FAILURE THIS RAIL EXISTS FOR: a switch reading "on" beside no explanation, while the log file
// (which nobody opens) carries the reason. The panel therefore reads the LIVE advertiser and prints
// the backend's own sentence for the reason code.
//
// 🪤 AND THE STATUS IS A WORD, not a colour (1.4.1) — 'Advertising' / 'Not advertising'.
