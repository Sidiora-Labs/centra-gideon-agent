/** Two of Memory's three deletes said "This cannot be undone" over a one-click Undo.
 *
 * `confirmDelete`'s default body is `'This cannot be undone.'`, and all three deletes in
 * `MemoryPanel.remove()` took it. For two of them it is false:
 *
 *   · **a semantic fact** — `vector_memory.delete_semantic` is a TOMBSTONE
 *     (`UPDATE semantic_memory SET is_deleted = 1`), the row keeps its `value_json`, AND
 *     `_log_event("delete", "semantic", key, existing["value_json"], …)` records the prior value. The
 *     data survives in two places.
 *   · **a lesson** — `delete_lesson` calls `delete_semantic` per match, so its event is
 *     `memory_type='semantic'` and undoes by the same route.
 *
 * And this very panel ships the undo: the History tab's `canUndo` is
 * `ev.memory_type === 'semantic' && UNDOABLE.has(ev.event_type)`, with `'delete'` in `UNDOABLE`.
 *
 * 🪤 OVERSTATING A LOSS IS ITS OWN DEFECT, not the safe direction to err in. Warnings work by being
 * scarce; one that cries irreversible over a reversible action is what teaches people to click through
 * the ones that mean it. This codebase already argues that from the other side — `settingsWriteReported`
 * is titled *"Reconciling is not the same as reporting"* for the mirror case.
 *
 * 🔑 THE DISCRIMINATOR IS IN THE SAME FUNCTION, and it is what makes this a precise correction rather
 * than a blanket softening: **episodic delete genuinely cannot be undone.** It is also a tombstone, but
 * `undo_event` refuses a non-semantic event and `canUndo` gates on `memory_type === 'semantic'`. Its copy
 * is correct and is deliberately untouched — asserted below, so a later sweep cannot "finish the job".
 *
 * 🪤 AND THE LESSON UNDO IS NOT THE SAME UNDO — saying only "reversible" would have been a second
 * overclaim in the other direction. `delete_lesson` also calls `_reverse_lesson`, which voids the
 * accumulated observations on purpose (its comment: the key is deterministic, so re-writing the rule
 * un-tombstones this row and "without the reversal it would return at the confidence it had when the
 * user threw it away"). `undo_event` only clears `is_deleted`. So the rule returns at RESET confidence,
 * and the copy says so.
