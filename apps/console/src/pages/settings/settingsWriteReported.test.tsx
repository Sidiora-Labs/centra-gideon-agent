// ── Reconciling is not the same as reporting ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is the third axis of the same programme: reads claimed things by going silent (669–676),
// writes claimed things by flipping state they never earned (677), and here a write's failure is
// *invisible* — the control ends up honest, or not, but the user is never told which.
//
// The settings hub's shared `mutate()` already did the hard half: it invalidates the widget's cache
// key so a rejected write RECONCILES — the toggle snaps back to the server's answer. Its own doc said
// "Errors are swallowed (the control resets visually)", and that was the whole story. A toggle that
// flips itself back with nothing said reads as a glitchy UI, not as a refusal. Reconciling makes the
// state honest; it does not make the outcome legible.
//
// Three sites, three different states of that idea — and two canonical forms already in the tree:
//
//   settingsWidgets.mutate()   reconciled, said nothing   → now notifies too (7 hub tiles inherit it)
//   VoicePanel.saveSettings    kept the REFUSED value     → rolls back (owns no read) + notifies
//   ModelsPanel.repair         no catch at all            → notifies, like its two siblings in-file
//
// 🪤 `VoicePanel`'s section takes `settings`/`setSettings` as PROPS and owns no read, so it cannot
// reconcile by re-reading — it rolls back to the pre-patch value instead. `WidgetFrame.pin` rolls
// back, `PinnedArtifacts.unpin` reconciles; both are sanctioned. Keeping a refused value is not.
