// ── An explanation written to be READ has to reach a reader ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `serviceWorkerBlockedReason` (MOBILE-COMPANION T3.1) exists to tell a user why install and offline
// are unavailable. Its own docstring makes the argument: *"Saying so out loud beats an install button
// that silently never appears."* It was tested, it was correct, and its ONLY consumer was
// `console.info` — so the sentence reached nobody. Censused before this change: zero production
// importers outside `registerServiceWorker.ts` itself.
//
// 🔑 WHY IT MATTERS IN PRACTICE, not in theory. A service worker requires a secure context, and the
// documented way to reach this gateway from another device is a plain-http LAN address
// (`http://192.168.1.5:10000`) — which is not one. So the common real-world case is exactly the one
// that silently offered nothing: no install affordance, no offline shell, no reason given.
//
// 🪤 A STATUS THAT IS ONLY A COLOUR FAILS 1.4.1. The row says "Available" / "Unavailable" in words and
// carries a shield icon; the tone is confirmation, never the message.
//
// 🪤 AND IT IS NOT A NEW SURFACE. `CompanionPanel` is the MOBILE-COMPANION settings panel — LAN
// discovery and instance name live there — and installing the PWA is how the dashboard gets onto a
// phone. Inventing an "Offline" panel for one row would have been the speculative move.

// The panel reads its config through `api.gideonConfig()`; stub it so the row renders.
// `companionDiscovery` (CA-5) is the live advertiser read the same panel makes — stubbed to the
// default "off" answer, which is the state this file's install/offline rows are asserted against.
