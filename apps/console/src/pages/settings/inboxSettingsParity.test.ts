// ── Two panels for one settings surface, and one of them was missing controls ─
//
// `InboxSettingsPanel` is defined TWICE — `pages/settings/` (reached via Settings → Inbox, the
// canonical home for every other inbox setting) and `pages/inbox/` (the in-context side panel).
// Both are live and imported by different pages, so neither is dead code; the drift was that
// they did not offer the same controls.
//
// Two config flags existed ONLY in the side panel:
//
//     inbox.enabled                        "Poll message sources"
//     inbox.engagement_ranking_enabled     "Engagement ranking"
//
// Both are real, consumed flags — `handlers_inbox.py` gates the ranking blend on the second
// ("GATED behind inbox.engagement_ranking_enabled"), and 7 + 3 backend references respectively.
// So a user who went to Settings → Inbox looking for them could not turn poll collection on and
// could not find the ranking switch at all. Verified live after the fix: both toggles render on
// #/settings/inbox, and a real click on "Engagement ranking" issues
// `PATCH /api/config/gideon {"path":"inbox.engagement_ranking_enabled","value":true}` and
// the value PERSISTS (false → true, then restored).
//
// This is a source scan because the invariant is "these two files offer the same controls", which
// is a relationship between files — a render test of either one in isolation cannot see it, and
// mounting both needs a live config fetch that jsdom has no answer for.
//
// NOT asserted: identical label text or identical layout. The side panel is a compact drawer and
// the settings page is a full form; `Retention (days)` vs a `Retention` row with a `days` suffix
// is the same control presented for its context, and forcing those to match would be flattening
// a real distinction. What must match is WHICH SETTINGS a user can reach.
