/** The settings hub fabricated the two most dangerous values in the product.
 *
 * `AgentDefaultsPanel` and the hub's `Agent defaults` tile share the cache key
 * `settings:agent-defaults`. The panel carries a 🔴 comment recording that it REMOVED
 * `.catch(() => ({}))` from its config read, because *"a settings panel must not present FABRICATED
 * values as saved state"*. **The hub kept it.** So the panel's fix was inert on the journey people
 * actually take:
 *
 *   direct to the panel   cache=null   → "Couldn't load your settings" + Retry   ✅ its fix works
 *   hub → the panel       cache="{…}"  → the full form, no error anywhere        🔴 its fix was inert
 *
 * `persist: true` mirrors the value into `sessionStorage`, so the substituted `{}` survived a full
 * reload, and because the fetcher RESOLVED, the panel's `if (!data && loadErr)` guard never fired —
 * `data` was defined, just empty.
 *
 * 🔴 WHAT THE EMPTY OBJECT CLAIMED, and why this key is worse than the legibility one that was fixed
 * first:
 *   · **Approval mode read "Ask each time"** from `?? 'interactive'`, while the stored default is
 *     `auto` (`AgentConfig.approval_mode`). The UI showed the SAFE mode and the runtime ran the
 *     permissive one — so someone could check their setting, see exactly what they wanted, change
 *     nothing, and have every tool call still execute unprompted.
 *   · **YOLO read OFF** from `!!c.yolo` — a switch whose entire purpose is auto-approve-everything.
 *
 * Both of those controls PATCH on change, so this is not only a wrong readout: a user "correcting" a
 * switch that was never loaded writes the opposite of what they believe is stored.
 *
 * 🪤 WHY THE SOURCE RAILS CARRY MOST OF THIS. `settingsWidgets.tsx` exports `SETTINGS_WIDGETS`, an
 * array of tiles holding hooks and importing the real panels — `appsTileCountsWhatItSays.test.ts`
 * records that importing it "drags the panel tree into a unit test", which is why every hub-tile rail
 * here is source-level. So the hub half is asserted in `configReadNotFabricated.test.ts` (the
 * fabricated value) and `tileLoadFailure.test.ts` (the shimmer/failure line). What THIS file adds is
 * the half that is genuinely behavioural and was never pinned anywhere: that a resolved-but-empty
 * cache entry really does defeat the panel's guard. That is the mechanism the whole fix turns on, and
 * prose is not evidence for it.
