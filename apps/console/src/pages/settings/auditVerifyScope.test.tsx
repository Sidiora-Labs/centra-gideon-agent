// ── A tamper-evidence verdict that overstated what it had checked ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `sel.verify_integrity` defaults to a 5000-entry cap — the live tamper-detection window, added
// because a full walk "had reached >1M entries, taking 20s+ and hanging the audit UI" (its own
// docstring) — and `GET /api/security/audit/verify` reported that honestly as `windowed: true`.
// **Nothing in the SPA read the flag**: `git grep -n windowed web/src` returned only the unrelated
// `WindowedList` primitive. So both consumers rendered the count alone:
//
//   AuditPanel      "Chain intact — 5000 events verified."
//   settings bento  "5000 events verified"
//
// On a tamper-evidence surface that reads as *the chain is intact*, full stop. Measured live:
// `{"checked": 5000, "ok": true, "valid": 5000, "tampered": 0, "windowed": true}`.
//
// 🔑 AND THE FIX HAD TO BE HONEST IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. On a fresh instance the same endpoint returned
// `{"checked": 43, ..., "windowed": true}` — the cap was SET but never bit, so "the last 43 events"
// would understate a complete answer exactly as badly as the original overstated a partial one.
// `windowed` cannot tell those apart, so the handler now also sends `window` (the cap it applied) and
// `capped()` compares. A total would be exact but costs the O(n) walk the window exists to avoid.
// The boundary case (log length == window) resolves as "capped": the safe direction to be wrong in.
//
// 🔑 WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: offer a "verify everything" button. `gideon security
// verify` already runs the exhaustive check — its own comment calls it "an explicit offline audit" —
// and a button here would re-create the hang the window was added to fix. So the panel NAMES the
// command, which is the same choice `DurabilityPanel` makes for `gideon restore --replace`.
