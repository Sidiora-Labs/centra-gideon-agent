 *  from its own manifest, the last drill's verdict, a plan-first preview and a
 *  merge-restore. `replace` restore is still command-line only — the server refuses one
 *  while the gateway runs and this panel IS the gateway, so a replace button here would

 *  on its own.
 *
 *  Rollback and revert are offered as distinct verbs with distinct copy because they

 *  to see it or to answer it, so the hold was permanent and silent. This is that answer.
 *
 *  Three states that must not look alike, and don't:
 *   · the queue could not be READ → an error, naming it, with a retry;
 *   · sync has never been configured → nothing has ever compared two machines, so an empty
 *     queue is not evidence of anything;
 *   · sync runs and nothing diverged → the good empty state.
 *
 *  Nothing here auto-applies: each decision names the version it writes and takes a
 *  confirmation, because two of the three overwrite a row the other machine also edited. */
