// ── ONE empty-state primitive, rolled out to the seven surfaces (OU-6) ──────────────────
//
// 🔑 THE DECISION THIS FILE PINS. OU-6 is written as "web/src/ui/EmptyState.tsx exists", which
// reads as a greenfield primitive. It is not one: `EmptyState` has existed since long before
// this atom, exported from the LIST KIT (`ui/ListScaffold.tsx`) beside its two siblings
// `LoadError` and `ListSkeleton`, and it is already the answer at ~30 call sites. Creating a
// second component at `ui/EmptyState.tsx` would be a dual path — two components answering one
// condition — which this repo forbids, and it would contradict an existing rail that pins the
// co-location ON PURPOSE:
//
//   loadErrorState.test.tsx › "the primitive is exported from the list kit, beside EmptyState"
//     "Co-located on purpose: the two are alternative answers to the same condition, and a
//      surface reaching for one should see the other."
//
// So the atom's FILENAME clause is satisfied by not honouring it, and its PRODUCT clause —
// every one of the seven surfaces explains itself and offers one working action — is what this
// file holds. Recorded as a DEVIATION in the plan's execution log.
//
// The two other empty-shaped components are NOT dual paths; each answers a different condition
// and says so in its own doc:
//   · `PresetEmptyState` (ui/PresetEmptyState.tsx) — the preset-first ON-RAMP for a surface
//     whose create flow front-loads its whole ontology. Offers finished examples that SEED the
//     existing form. Its doc names the distinction: "Distinct from EmptyState (ListScaffold),
//     which states a fact and offers one CTA." Triggers uses it, which is why Triggers is
//     allowed to satisfy the rollout through that primitive instead.
//   · `SlotEmptyState` (pages/dashboard/widgets/kit.tsx) — an inline one-line dashed strip
//     sized for a DASHBOARD WIDGET SLOT, not a page or panel body.
//
// ── AND: the honesty precondition ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An empty state that renders when the data merely FAILED TO LOAD is not an empty state, it is
// a confident wrong answer. Auditing the seven for this atom found `#/loops` doing exactly
// that (`.catch(() => [] as GoalLoop[])` in its fetcher → "No loops yet — Start a loop" on a
// 500). That fix joined the existing family rail rather than growing a second one; see
// `ui/loadErrorState.test.tsx`'s ADOPTERS entry for `pages/loops/LoopsListPage.tsx`.

// ── PEP-2: the CROSS-SURFACE sweep ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// OU-6 (above) rolled ONE primitive out to seven surfaces. PEP-2 asks a different question of
// every list surface in the app: does a user who lands on it EMPTY find a way in?
//
// The census below is the atom's deliverable, and it is a census rather than a spot-check on
// purpose: "I swept everything" with no per-surface verdict is not evidence, and the failure mode
// of a sweep is a surface nobody classified. It was built by extracting every `<EmptyState>` and
// `<PresetEmptyState>` element from `src/pages/**` — 57 sites across 30 files — and reducing each
// file to the branch a user meets when the collection is GENUINELY empty (not filtered).
//
// Four verdicts, and only the first is a defect:
//
//   'on-ramp'    the genuinely-empty branch carries an action that reaches an existing create
//                flow. Most surfaces already did; three did not and were fixed by this atom.
//   'produced'   nothing for the user to create — the collection fills itself (agent proposals,
//                digests, extracted entities) or filling it IS the good news (no contradictions,
//                nothing to review). Manufacturing a CTA here would invent work.
//   'derived'    the rows are a projection of another collection the user does own, so the
//                on-ramp belongs to that collection's surface, not this one.
//   'degenerate' only reachable on an install missing its own bundled data. Kept honest (the
//                fact plus whatever path exists) but not worth a preset grid.
//
// 🚧 THE TRIGGERS FENCE, NARROWED 2026-08-28 — its original reason has EXPIRED. It read:
// "`pages/triggers/*` and the Automations surface were being changed concurrently by TSE-4, so this
// atom did not touch them." TSE-4 is ✅ done (`docs/roadmap/atomic/TSE.md`) and no open PR touches
// `pages/triggers/*`, so concurrency is no longer a reason to leave two files unclassified — and an
// `offLimits` entry whose stated cause is gone is indistinguishable from an unexamined surface.
//
// Of the two findings it recorded, ONE is now classified and one still cannot be:
//
//   (b) `WeekGridView`'s "No fires this week" has no on-ramp → **classified 'derived' below, which
//       means it is NOT a defect.** Only the 'on-ramp' verdict is. The grid plots projected fires of
//       triggers the user owns on the sibling List view, one `Segmented` away — the same shape as
//       `Tasks › Graph`. The finding was recorded before the taxonomy could be applied to it,
//       precisely because the file was fenced.
//   (a) A fresh home is NOT trigger-empty — `reconcile_digest_cron` registers
//       `system:notification-digest` at every boot, so a newcomer's first visit is machine-named
//       system rows and NO empty state, since the preset grid is gated on `counts.all === 0`.
//       `TriggersListPage.tsx` therefore stays fenced, but for a DIFFERENT reason than before: its
//       code does carry an on-ramp (`PresetEmptyState` + `TRIGGER_PRESETS`), so 'on-ramp' would pass
//       this file's own assertion while being unreachable in practice. Classifying it either way
//       would assert something false, and whether those rows are hidden, counted separately, or
//       renamed is an owner scope call (tracked as TC-8). **Do not classify it to close the hole.**
