/** OU-7 — blast-radius DERIVATION for an approval prompt (Contract C2,
 *  `docs/roadmap/plans/ONBOARDING-UX.md`).
 *
 *  This module DESCRIBES what a pending tool call can touch so the human weighing
 *  an approval can see it at a glance. It DECIDES nothing. Nothing gates on its
 *  result, and nothing may: the approval gate, trust-reads and the task-mode gate
 *  all live in `src/gideon/task_modes.py` + `src/gideon/gateway.py` and
 *  are unchanged by this file. Read-only consumption of classifications the backend
 *  already computed — per C2, "no security-logic change".
 *
 *  CONSUMERS: `pages/chat/ApprovalCard` renders these facets as chips and
 *  `app/approvalToast` renders the same vocabulary as one line (both landed with
 *  OU-8); `OU-9` carries the same fields over `ChannelDelivery.request_approval`.
 *  The facet WORDS live here too, beside the derivation, so the surfaces cannot
 *  drift into three vocabularies for one claim.
 *
 *  ── Honesty contract ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Every returned boolean is a POSITIVE claim; `false` means "not established",
 *  never "verified absent". Two consequences the callers depend on:
 *
 *  1. `undefined` is returned whenever NO facet could be established. An all-false
 *     object would render as four negatives ("no writes, no network, no shell, not
 *     read-only") — a confident claim from zero evidence. Absence is C2's own
 *     unknown channel (`blastRadius?`), so the renderer simply shows no chips.
 *  2. `readOnly` is only ever claimed on positive evidence, and never alongside an
 *     established write. Under-claiming safety is the correct direction to err.
 *
 *  ── Why `risk` is optional ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  The two surfaces that ask for permission carry DIFFERENT data:
 *    - chat: the `approval` WS event carries `risk` (`chat_runner.py`, broadcast as
 *      the resolved EFFECTIVE risk) → read into `ApprovalSegment['risk']` at
 *      `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx:911`.
 *    - the approvals queue behind `#/companion`: `GET /api/approvals` returns
 *      `PendingApproval` (`web/src/lib/api.ts:1661`) = {id, source, tool,
 *      tool_input?, tool_purpose?, session, ts} — there is NO `risk` field.
 *  So `risk` must be absent-able, and its absence must not silently imply a read.
 *  With no risk we fall back to tool-name evidence alone, which can still establish
 *  writes/network/shell positively and can still leave everything unknown
 *  (→ `undefined`).
 *
 *  ── Why `readOnlyCommand` has no caller yet ──────────────────────────────────
 *  C2 names "command-screening classification" as a third input. That classification
 *  exists — `is_read_only_bash()` (`src/gideon/task_modes.py:88`) is run per
 *  approval at `src/gideon/dashboard/chat_runner.py:2593` and stored as
 *  `perm_meta["is_read_only"]` — but it is NOT on the `approval` WS payload and is
 *  read by nothing, backend or frontend. So the parameter is declared here with the
 *  exact shape that classification produces and NO caller supplies it today; wiring
 *  the pass-through is OU-8/OU-9's scope. It is not re-implemented client-side: this
 *  module never inspects a command string, because deciding whether a command is
 *  read-only IS security logic and it already has an owner.
