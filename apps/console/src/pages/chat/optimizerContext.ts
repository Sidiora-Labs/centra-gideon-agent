// Optimizer context assembly (CHAT-CRAFT CC-5).
//
// The prompt optimizer sees only what the composer hands it, so the quality of
// `/api/optimizer/optimize`'s rewrite IS the quality of this one string. Three
// properties carry that weight, and each fails silently if it slips:
//
//  1. **Role labels.** "that file from earlier" is resolvable only if the model can
//     tell who mentioned the file. An unlabeled blob reads as a single voice, so the
//     optimizer guesses at the referent instead of reading it.
//  2. **Newest-last.** The handler keeps the TAIL of an over-long context, so the
//     newest exchange is the half that survives a cut. Backwards and the truncation
//     throws away exactly the turns the draft is most likely to be about.
//  3. **Whole turns only.** Budgeting the turn count here — instead of handing over a
//     long string and letting the handler cut it — is what keeps a surviving turn's
//     role label attached to its body. A character-slice decapitates the oldest
//     survivor and attributes its words to nobody.
//
// `CTX_BUDGET_CHARS` is the worst case this module can emit. The handler's
// `MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` (src/gideon/dashboard/handlers/optimizer.py) is derived
// from the same three numbers, so a well-formed composer context is never cut at all.
// If the two drift apart, the handler quietly starts cutting again.
