// ── Three bare integers, and an 11px glyph deciding which is which ───────────────────────────────
//
// A native agent row ends with up to three counts: skills, tools, triggers. Each was
// `<Sparkles size={11} /> {n}` — a glyph and a number, with **no `title`, no `aria-label`, and no
// `<title>` in the svg**. Measured on the live DOM against `demo-home`: `gideon-loop` exposed
// `"1"` and `gideon-template-refiner` exposed `"2"`, and nothing said what was being counted.
// One skill and one tool are indistinguishable.
//
// 🔑 WHY `role="img"` AND NOT A VISIBLE NOUN. Both forms exist in this tree, and the census says which
// belongs here. Seven sites put the noun in visible text — `{items.length} queued`,
// `{bottlenecks.length} bottleneck{s}`, `{plan.length} stage{s} planned`, `{activity.length} steps`,
// `{proposals.length} name{s} to decide on`, … — all of them in a row with room to spare. The one site
// shaped like THIS one is `settings/FeedbackPanel`: two bare counts side by side in a dense row, a 10px
// ThumbsUp/ThumbsDown as the only carrier, fixed with `role="img"` + a label and its rail stating "the
// visible text is untouched: this is an accessibility-tree fix and the captures are identical". The
// agents cluster is `hidden sm:flex shrink-0` with up to three counts abreast, so it is that shape.
//
// 🪤 AND THE ROLE IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT BOILERPLATE. `settings/ModelsPanel` records it on its breaker
// dot: **on a role-less `<span>`, `aria-label` is a PROHIBITED attribute and the name is DISCARDED.**
// So labelling these without `role="img"` reads as a complete fix in the diff and changes nothing in
// the accessibility tree — which is why this rail asserts the pair, never the label alone.
//
// 🪤 SOURCE-LEVEL BECAUSE THE ROW IS NOT EXPORTED. `NativeRow` is a local function, so there is no
// component to render — the same reason `ui/danglingSeparator.test.ts` reads this file as text. The
// live DOM reading above is the evidence and lives in the PR.
