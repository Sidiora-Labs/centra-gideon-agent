// ── The Native section caption must not promise what its rows refuse ─────────────────────────────

// The Native group renders BOTH populations in one section: reserved built-ins (definition
// fixed — the backend answers DELETE with 403 and `handlers/agents.py` sets
// `editable: not is_reserved_agent`) and user-created agents (fully editable). On a fresh
// instance the built-ins are the MAJORITY of rows. The section subtitle read "Your
// Gideon agent definitions — fully editable." — a blanket promise the very rows under
// it contradict with their own Lock + built-in chips, and that `AgentDetail` corrects two
// clicks later ("Its definition is fixed…"). Row-level presentation was already honest;
// only the section promise lied.
