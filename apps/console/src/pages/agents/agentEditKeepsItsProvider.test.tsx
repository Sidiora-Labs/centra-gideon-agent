/** Editing an agent must not rewrite its provider or its origin.
 *
 * `AgentForm.draftToPayload` is shared by the create PAGE and by `AgentDetail`'s in-panel EDIT, and it
 * stated two fields the form has no control for:
 *
 *   provider: 'native',  source: 'gideon',
 *
 * `PUT /api/agents/{name}` applies each field whenever its key is present — `if "provider" in body:
 * agent.provider = body.get("provider", "")`, and the same for `source`. So changing one word of an
 * agent's description rewrote both. Two distinct losses:
 *
 *  1. **`acp:<cli>` → native.** The profile's runtime binding is destroyed, and `provider_agent` /
 *     `acp_mode` — meaningful only under an ACP provider — are left behind as fields nothing reads.
 *  2. **`'' → native`.** `AgentProfile.provider` is declared `default=""` with *"Empty inherits the
 *     global agent.provider default"*, resolved at `loader.py:4325` as `provider or
 *     config.agent.provider`. An agent that was FOLLOWING the global got silently pinned. This half
 *     needs no ACP setup at all to hit — it is every profile whose provider was never set explicitly.
 *
 * …plus `source`, documented as *"Agent origin: gideon, marketplace, or builtin"*: a
 * marketplace-installed agent recorded itself as hand-authored. Nothing gates behaviour on it today,
 * so that half falsifies provenance rather than breaking function.
 *
 * 🪤 AND NOTHING WARNED, because the one surface that could have shown the mismatch was hiding it:
 * `AgentDetail`'s chip was the literal string 'Native' for every non-reserved agent while
 * `providerMeta` sat imported and unused in the same file. An ACP profile read "Native" BEFORE the edit
 * made it true.
 *
 * 🔑 THE FIX SHAPE IS NOT MINE — it is issue 689's, which this file is named after
 * (`schedule/renameKeepsItsAction.test.ts`). There, renaming a notification trigger replaced its
 * action, because `ScheduleForm.draftToPayload` described an action the form could not edit. That
 * file's recorded verdict: *"The server was never at fault: `_update_schedule` only touches the action
 * when one is present in the body… So the fix is to stop describing an action the form cannot edit."*
 * Identical server contract, identical cure. The assertions below sit on the same boundary it chose —
 * the payload — because that is where the data was destroyed.
