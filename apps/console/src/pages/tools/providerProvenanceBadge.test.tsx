// ── The Tools page must not call an installed community bundle `built-in` (#2627) ─────────────────
//
// The install dialog carefully discloses "Unsigned — community tier" and the user consents to THAT.
// The Tools page then badged the same bundle `built-in` — the identical word core's own first-party
// providers get. The badge was a binary, `providerLocked ? 'platform' : 'built-in'`, and an installed
// community app is exactly the shape that falls through it: `native` kind, not locked.
//
// 🔑 WHY THIS IS NOT COSMETIC. The tiers exist to inform consent. The Tools page is where a user
// later goes to audit what is running and where it came from — and at that moment the tier was gone
// and the answer was wrong in the REASSURING direction. Compare the adjacent handling in the same
// component: MCP groups get a live health dot with a tone and a detail tooltip, so provenance
// plainly mattered elsewhere on this page.
//
// 🪤 THREE STATES ARE ASSERTED, NOT ONE. A fix that renders every native group as its tier trades one
// wrong label for another: a genuine core provider must still read `built-in` and a locked one must
// still read `platform`. Both are pinned below, from the same mount as the new state.
//
// 🪤 AND THE TWO SURFACES ARE ASSERTED AGAINST THE SHARED MAP, NOT AGAINST TWO LITERALS. Two
// independent literals *is* the defect — it is how the badge and the dialog came to describe the same
// bytes differently — so a test that hardcoded "community tier" on both sides would pass on the day
// they drift again. Everything here reads `TRUST_TIER_LABEL`, and the source guard at the bottom
// pins that neither surface has re-grown a literal of its own.
