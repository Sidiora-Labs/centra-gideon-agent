/** Deleting a project destroyed every task in it, and the dialog promised the opposite.
 *
 * `ProjectsSection.del()` asked for confirmation with:
 *
 *     "Its context directory and task lists are removed — the tasks themselves stay."
 *
 * `tasks/hierarchy_handlers.py` resolves every task scoped to the project and deletes each one —
 * `list_all_tasks(project=…, limit=10_000)` → `delete_task(t.id)` → `native.py`'s `path.unlink()`.
 * No trash, no soft-delete, no version history; the tombstone stores only an id, so it is a sync
 * breadcrumb and not a recovery path. Titles, descriptions, action plans, exit criteria, research
 * notes, execution notes and comments all go.
 *
 * 🔴 THE FAILURE MODE IS THE ASSERTION, NOT THE OMISSION. A dialog that said nothing about tasks
 * would have left the user uninformed. This one told them the tasks were safe, so the click that
 * destroyed a project's entire task history was the one that read as cautious.
 *
 * 🪤 AND THE COMMENT ABOVE IT WAS THE CAUSE. It reasoned carefully — and from the wrong function.
 * `hierarchy.delete_project` genuinely does unlink the list files and leave the task rows alone; its
 * docstring says so, and reading it produces exactly the sentence that shipped. But #457 added the
 * cascade in the CALLING handler, above that function, because orphaned rows pointing at dead list
 * ids were "unreachable from every scoped view". The docstring is still accurate about the function
 * it documents. The dialog was describing an inner contract instead of the operation the button runs.
 * **Copy written against a callee goes stale the first time a caller does more** — which is the
 * transferable lesson, and why the rails below assert against the HANDLER, not against `delete_project`.
 *
 * 🔑 THE CASCADE IS NOT THE BUG. #457's reasoning holds: unreachable orphans are worse than deleted
 * rows. This change is entirely about informed consent, and deliberately leaves the behaviour alone.
