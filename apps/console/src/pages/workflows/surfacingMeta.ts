 *  def detail view must render the SAME tone and label for a given state. Three components each
 *  choosing their own colour is how an "overdue" template looks urgent in one place and calm in
 *  another.
 *
 *  All pure. The backend already decided the state (`GET /api/workflows/surfacing` computes
 *  freshness, overdue and the doctor findings from `sort_key`/`freshness`/`doctor`) — recomputing
 *  any of it here would be a second implementation of a rule that already has an owner, and the
