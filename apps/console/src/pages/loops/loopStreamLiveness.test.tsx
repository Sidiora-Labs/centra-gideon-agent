// ── The loop cockpit's feed, same defect as the workflow run view ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `useRunStream` swallowed `onerror` with "transient — EventSource retries automatically". The browser
// does retry forever, which is why there is no give-up branch to notice: the cockpit just stops
// updating, and its status line keeps saying **Working** whether the loop is thinking or the feed is
// gone. Ported from `workflows/useWorkflowStream` (the reference implementation) rather than re-derived.
//
// 🪤 THIS HOOK HAS FOUR CONSUMERS AND ONLY ONE SHOWS THE SIGNAL. That is stated as an INCOMPLETENESS,
// not dressed up as a decision: `loops/LoopCockpitPage` is the primary loop run view and gets it now.
// `loops/DesignCockpitPage` and `code/CodeCockpitPage` are also full-page watch surfaces and **should
// follow** — they were left only because each has its own bespoke header and no shared component to edit
// once. `loops/LoopPlanReview` is a review panel rather than a live watch view, so it is the one genuine
// opt-out. Returning the flag is backwards-compatible: all four compile unchanged.
