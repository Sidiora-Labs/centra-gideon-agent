// ── The dashboard's slot-empty states must not be bare facts ─────────────────
//
// MEASURED on a fresh install (empty `GIDEON_HOME`, past onboarding, `#/dashboard` at
// 1440×1000): **seven** slot-empty strips render at once, and six of them either name the
// mechanism that will fill them —
//
//   "No active work. Loops you launch appear here as they run."
//   "No pinned artifacts. Pin one from its page to keep it here."
//   "No models are loaded. One loads on its first use."
//   "No suggestions yet — they build from your activity."
//
// — or are a finished verdict ("All clear — nothing waiting on you."), or carry an on-ramp
// ("No tasks ready to work." + "+ New task"). ONE was a bare fact with neither: Schedule's
// "No recent scheduled runs." This is the app's first screen, so the slot that teaches nothing
// is the most expensive one to leave alone.
//
// This rail is a RATCHET, not a grader. It does not judge prose quality — it asserts a
// mechanical floor that a bare one-clause fact with no action cannot pass, so the NEXT slot
// added to the dashboard cannot quietly reintroduce the shape.
//
// 🔑 Read-error states are held to a DIFFERENT bar and excluded here on purpose. "Couldn't read
// what's loaded on this machine." is not failing to teach a mechanism — there is no mechanism to
// teach, the read failed. Conflating the two would have forced error copy to grow a fake
// on-ramp. They are counted and reported separately so the exclusion cannot silently swallow a
// real empty state.
