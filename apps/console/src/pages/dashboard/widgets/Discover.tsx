 *  same shared-layout spring the rest of the shell uses, so the promotion reads as
 *  the card actually moving forward rather than a list re-flowing.
 *
 *  Why a deck and not a list: the tips are a queue the user works through one at a
 *  time, and a deck says "one thing to look at now, more behind it" in a fraction of
 *  the vertical space three stacked cards took. The full grouped list stays on the
 *  Discover hub for anyone who wants to browse rather than be led.
 *
 *  Propose-don't-write: a tip only points (deep-links into an existing page) and
 *  hides (dismiss persists; an area auto-hides once used). It never enables or
 *  configures anything — the user acts. */

  // FAILED read and a not-yet-arrived read both announced a setting the user never touched — and
  // the genuinely-off case, the only one that sentence is true for, offered no way to change it.
  // Measured on an empty home with `/api/legibility/discover` aborted: this slot said "Discover
  // tips are off." while `#/discover`, on the identical rejection, said "Couldn't load your tips"
  // with a Retry; and 1.6s into a delayed load it said the same thing again.
  //
  // Three conditions, three answers, all three borrowed from something already shipped:
  //  · failed  → the honest read-error slot `OnThisMachine`/`PinnedArtifacts` already use, with
  //              `#/discover`'s own noun for the thing ("your tips").
  //  · unread  → nothing, exactly as `OnThisMachine` and `PinnedArtifacts` do for `!data`. A slot
  //              that says nothing for a moment is not a claim; a wrong sentence is.
  //  · off     → the fact PLUS the on-ramp `#/discover`'s off-branch already carries, to the same
  //              route (`settings/legibility`) under the same label.
