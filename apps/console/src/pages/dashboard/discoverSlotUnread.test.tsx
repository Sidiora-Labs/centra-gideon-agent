// ── One sentence must not answer three different questions ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The dashboard's Discover slot branched `if (!discover || !discover.enabled)` onto a single line:
// **"Discover tips are off."** `discover` is `null` for THREE unrelated reasons — the read failed,
// the read has not landed yet, or the user really did turn tips off — so two thirds of the time that
// line was a confident claim about a SETTING THE USER NEVER TOUCHED, on the app's first screen.
//
// Measured on a genuinely empty home (`GIDEON_HOME=/tmp/wave2-firstrun-empty`, no `--seed`),
// dashboard at 1440×1000, with `/api/legibility/discover` intercepted:
//
//   aborted read  → dashboard slot: "Discover tips are off."
//                   `#/discover`  : "Couldn't load your tips" · "Failed to fetch" · Retry  ← correct
//   read delayed  → dashboard slot at 1.6 s: "Discover tips are off."
//   genuinely off → dashboard slot: "Discover tips are off." and NO way to turn them on;
//                   `#/discover`  : "Discover is off" + what tips are + "Open Settings"    ← correct
//
// Same endpoint, same condition, two surfaces, and the page had already been fixed for exactly this
// reason — its loader carries the comment *"Swallowing the rejection made `data` falsy, which this
// render reads as 'Discover is off' — so a failed request did not merely say nothing, it made a
// FALSE CLAIM ABOUT A SETTING."* This file holds the widget to the same standard, and the fix
// borrows three shipped forms rather than inventing any: `doctorErr`'s split in `DashboardLive`,
// `OnThisMachine`/`PinnedArtifacts`'s honest read-error slot, and `#/discover`'s own on-ramp.
//
// 🪤 The off-branch keeps the LABEL the page uses ("Open Settings"), not "Turn them on": the control
// navigates, it does not toggle. Naming it for the toggle would be the copy defect one layer down.
