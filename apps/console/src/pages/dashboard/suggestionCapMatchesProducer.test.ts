// ── The two consumers of /api/suggestions must not show different amounts of one list ────────────
//
// `#/dashboard`'s `Suggestions` widget rendered `items.slice(0, 5)` while `#/chat`'s
// `SuggestionChips` rendered `slice(0, 6)` — the same endpoint, two surfaces, different answers to
// "how many suggestions do I have". The backend settles it: `suggestions.py`'s parser caps the
// model's reply at `[:6]` and `_FALLBACK_SUGGESTIONS` is exactly six, so on a brand-new install
// (where the fallback is what you always get) the dashboard dropped the sixth on every render, with
// no affordance to reach it. Each one is generated per user from their own memory.
//
// 🪤 THIS ASSERTS THE AGREEMENT, NOT THE NUMBER. Pinning `6` in a test is how you end up with a
// third place to update when the producer changes — the same failure that left two stale hint counts
// in `ui/forms.tsx`. What is asserted is that the two consumer caps are EQUAL and that neither
// exceeds the Python parser's cap. Move the producer to eight and this rail asks for eight.
//
// 🪤 AND IT IS NOT ABOUT DISCLOSURE. `ui/cappedListDisclosed.test.tsx` already censused 29 rendered
// caps and deliberately left the dashboard widget previews alone, because they state no total and
// adding one is a per-surface copy decision. That ruling stands and this rail does not touch it: a
// silent cap is fine, a silent cap BELOW the producer's is discarded work.

// This file sits at `web/src/pages/dashboard/`, so the repo root is four levels up. Anchored on
// `import.meta.dirname` rather than `process.cwd()`, which differs between a root-level
// `npm run test:web` and a `cd web && vitest`.
