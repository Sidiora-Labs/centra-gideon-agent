// ── The typed error code the funnel was throwing away, and the six branches that waited ──────
//
// `lib/errText.ts` parsed `{"error": {"code", "message"}}` and kept only the sentence. `ApiError`
// carried only `.status`. So four learning panels matched their code against the human copy
// (`error.message.includes('evals_disabled')`) — and no message ever contains its own code.
//
// DRIVEN on a real gateway (`--seed demo-home`, port 10784, viewport 1440×1000 and 390×844),
// `#/learning`, with the four `/api/evals/*` responses read off the wire:
//
//   evals.enabled = false  → all four answer 404 `evals_disabled`
//     BEFORE  4 × red role="alert" "Couldn't load your judge benchmark / studies / retrieval
//             benchmark / ablation report", each with a Retry that cannot ever succeed
//     AFTER   4 × "The eval substrate is off, so no <x> can run — turn on Evals enabled in
//             Settings → Evaluations." — one link to `#/settings/evals`, no Retry
//
//   evals.enabled = true, nothing run yet → 404 `judge_bench_absent` / `retrieval_absent` /
//   `ablation_absent` (studies answers 200 `{"studies": []}`)
//     BEFORE  3 × the same red "Couldn't load your …" + dead Retry
//     AFTER   3 × the panel's own run command as guidance
//
// 🪤 THE FIXTURE IS THE DEFECT. Every existing test for these branches passed by rejecting with
// `new Error('ablation_absent')` — a "message" that IS the code, which nothing on the wire ever
// sends. `includes()` matched the test's own invention. So every body below is verbatim from
// `curl`, and each case asserts the vacuity floor: the message does NOT contain the code, so the
// old prose predicate is proven to have been false for exactly these responses.
//
// 🔑 AND THE ONE COPY THAT EXISTED FOR THIS STATE WAS WRONG. `AblationPanel`'s `evals_disabled`
// branch said "Turn on `evals.enabled` in Settings" and linked `#/settings`. `evals.enabled` was
// in `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` but on no settings surface — the link led to a page with no such control.
// Being unreachable is what kept that invisible.
//
// 🔁 AND THAT IS WHY ONE ASSERTION HERE INVERTED. This file shipped with a rail forbidding a
// Settings link, whose stated reason was that `#/settings` had no evals control — measured, and
// true at the time. `#/settings/evals` now exists (`pages/settings/EvalsPanel.tsx`, the five
// allowlisted `evals.*` keys), so the rail's premise is gone and it now enforces the OPPOSITE
// property in the same spirit: the link must be DEEP (`#/settings/evals`, never the bare
// 34-card hub), and there must still be exactly ONE instruction — so the CLI command it used to
// print is now asserted ABSENT. The invariant that never moved: this state hands the user exactly
// one place to go, and that place has the control.
