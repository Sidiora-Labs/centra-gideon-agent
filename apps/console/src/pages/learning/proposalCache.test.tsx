// ── #676: a decided proposal must leave the screen ───────────────────────────
//
// Measured before the fix: DELETE /api/learning/proposals/{id} returned 200, the server's own list
// went to `rows: 0`, and the row was still on screen at 7.5s with no second request. `decide()`
// dropped the cache entry and stopped there — that arms the next MOUNT, it does not re-render the
// live one. The row was not merely cosmetic either: a second Reject on the ghost escalates the
// rejection cooldown (learning/proposals.py:298-302), so the user's own retry compounds the damage.
//
// The button read "Dismiss" when #676 was written and reads "Reject" now: the app reserves Dismiss
// for triaging an item off a list (InboxDetail writes `status: 'dismissed'`), and this declines a
// PROPOSAL. Same handler, same endpoint — only the label moved, so these assertions are unchanged
// in substance.
//
// The first describe drives the REAL page, because that is the only thing that proves the row is
// gone from the DOM — a helper test can only prove the helper. The second pins the cache reasoning
// the helper carries (facet sweep, week left alone), which the page cannot show.
