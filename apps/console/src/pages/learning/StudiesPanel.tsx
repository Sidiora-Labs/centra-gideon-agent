/** Pre-registered template A/B studies (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §2 / ES-5).
 *
 *  The formal answer to "is template v(N+1) actually better than v(N)?" — k paired runs over
 *  the study's registered input cases, judged blind at both positions, against a rubric hashed
 *  before arm 1 ran.
 *
 *  Three rendering rules, each of which exists because breaking it would report the
 *  opposite of what happened:
 *
 *  1. **`null` is "not measured", never 0.** An unmeasurable agreement rate is exactly WHY a
 *     study is `judge_unreliable`; drawing it as 0% would claim we measured a catastrophically
 *     position-biased judge, when the truth is that no pair was judgeable at all.
 *  2. **`invalidated` and `judge_unreliable` are shown as loudly as a win.** They are the
 *     append-only honesty §2.4 asks for. A UI that hid them would leave a user believing the
 *     study had not run, and the next thing they would do is re-register it — which is
 *     precisely the re-interpretation the pre-registration exists to prevent.
 *  3. **Nothing is re-decided here.** The verdict, the floor it was judged against and the
 *     locked-check regressions all arrive computed. A panel that re-derived "did it win"
 *     from `win_rate > 0.5` would eventually disagree with the substrate, and the copy
 *     shipping the permissive answer would be this one.
 *
 *  🔴 The rubric TEXT and the `locked/` checks are absent by design, not by omission — the
 *  server does not serve them (§2.2), so there is nothing here to render. The rubric's hash
 *  is shown instead: enough to prove the pin, not enough to satisfy it. */
