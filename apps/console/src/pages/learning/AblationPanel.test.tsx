/** ES-7's keep/remove/lighten report — and, first, the fact that anything reads it at all.
 *
 *  `GET /api/evals/ablation` shipped REGISTERED, TESTED and documented in `routes.md` with **no
 *  frontend consumer**. Its ES-7 execution log flagged that deliberately rather than
 *  half-shipping a panel. So the load-bearing test in this file is not any of the rendering
 *  cases below — it is `is rendered BY LearningPage`, because a suite that only mounts
 *  `AblationPanel` in isolation stays green with the render deleted from the page, which
 *  reproduces the exact defect one level up.
 *
 *  The rendering cases then cover the two things a report that has usually NEVER RUN gets
 *  wrong:
 *
 *  1. An unmeasured arm must not render as a zero. For an ablation this is sharper than for the
 *     judge bench: `mean_score: null` means no cell was ever scored, and drawing 0.000 for it
 *     turns "we never measured this" into "it scored nothing" — the strongest possible case for
 *     deleting the component, asserted from a measurement that did not happen.
 *  2. EMPTY must not look like BROKEN. The backend mints three distinct codes on purpose; a
 *     failed fetch that renders as "no ablation has run yet" is the recurring defect this
 *     section exists to refuse.
