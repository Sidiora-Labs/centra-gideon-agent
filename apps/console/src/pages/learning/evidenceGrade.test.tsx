// ── ES-7 §3.1: the evidence TIER is read, not merely stamped ──────────────────
//
// `file_retirement_proposal` files a LEARN-R9 retirement whose evidence is a paired on/off ablation
// and stamps `evidence_strength: "ablation"` to say which KIND of claim it is. Measured before this
// suite: the tier had nine `enqueue` call sites across eight modules and ZERO readers anywhere — no
// gate, no inbox projection, no API payload, no frontend. So the row a human decides a RETIREMENT
// on read `1 evidence ref` whether the null result was measured or merely co-occurred, and the
// deleted stamp would have reddened nothing but an assertion on the returned object.
//
// Two rails, because either alone is satisfiable by dead code: the LABEL distinguishes the tiers,
// and `LearningPage` is what CALLS it. A suite that only tested `evidenceLabel` would stay green
// with the call deleted from the page — which is exactly the state the field was already in.
