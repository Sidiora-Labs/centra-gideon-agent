// ── The install-consent modal's BLOCKED states have to read correctly ──────────────────────────────
//
// SH-3 landed this surface with no rail of its own, and it is the surface a user consents over a
// supply-chain decision on. It is also invisible to every route census the loop runs: the modal only
// exists after an install attempt comes back blocked, so `#/apps` in its default state never renders
// it. Driven for the first time via stubbed `POST /api/apps` responses
// (`.validation/ux/probes/install-consent-modal.mjs`), all four branches at both themes.
//
// 🔑 WHAT THE SWEEP FOUND CLEAN, so a later pass does not re-audit it: axe (wcag2a/aa, 21a/aa, 22aa)
// reported **0 serious or critical** on the dialog in all four branches × both themes; every control
// is ≥24px (2.5.8); `aria-modal="true"` is present; and nothing inside the dialog actually scrolls, so
// there is no unnamed/unreachable scroll region — the `curl … | sh` one-liner the guide documents
// fits without overflow. The tab strip that reveals the Store was checked too and is correct
// (`role="tablist"` + `aria-label` + `aria-selected` + roving `tabindex`).
//
// 🪤 AND ONE "FINDING" WAS MY OWN INSTRUMENT. The probe first reported the 20px dialog title at
// **1.27:1** in light. The title is `rgb(31,31,31)` on a header painted
// `oklab(0.999994 … / 0.95)` — essentially white, so the real ratio is ~18:1. The probe's colour
// parser took the first three numbers out of `oklab(…)` and read them as RGB. **A contrast number is
// only as good as the colour-space parsing behind it.**
//
// ── What this rail pins ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. THE DISMISS VERB. On a terminal refusal the footer has exactly one button and nothing to cancel —
//    the install was already refused server-side. "Cancel" claims a pending action is being abandoned
//    and invites the reading that the app might otherwise still install. Censused the app's modal
//    footers: `Done` ×3 (this file's client-install branch, `chat/SessionSkillsReview`, `ChatPage`),
//    `Close` ×1 (`code/CodeCockpitPage`, beside a "Try again"), and `Cancel` ×11 — every one of which
//    sits next to a committing button. So `Done` is the shipped verb for a dismiss-only footer and
//    this is convergence, not invention.
//
//    🪤 `AppsSection`'s install and update modals look like the same shape (`Cancel` + a conditional
//    `Install anyway`) but are NOT: their else-branch always renders a commit button — disabled, with
//    the refusal as its `disabledReason` — so those footers are never dismiss-only and "Cancel" is
//    correct there. Read both branches before calling two footers the same footer.
//
// 2. THE SENTENCE BOUNDARY. `app_manager` composes the client-install reason without terminal
//    punctuation ("'<name>' installs on your local machine, not this server") and this surface appends
//    "Run this in your terminal:" to it, which rendered as one run-on line. Only the hard-coded
//    fallback ends in a period, which is why the seam is invisible in review and appears only on the
//    real path.
//
// 🪤 DELIBERATELY NOT CHANGED, with the reason, so the next pass does not "finish" it:
//   • The refusal reason appears TWICE on an invalid-signature refusal — once in the lead sentence
//     from `terminalRefusalReason`, once in `SignatureRow`'s red detail line. Removing either is not a
//     local edit: `AppsSection`'s modals surface that same reason only as a button `disabledReason`
//     tooltip, so `SignatureRow`'s line is the ONLY place a user reads it there. Deciding where the
//     reason canonically lives spans three surfaces and a shared security-copy function — recorded,
//     not guessed.
//   • "Security scan: clean" renders in green ABOVE "Invalid signature — install refused" in red.
//     That ordering is deliberate per the component's own docstring: provenance and content are two
//     different questions, and showing only one invites "it scanned clean" to be read as "it is from
//     who it says". The blocking sentence already leads the modal, so the green line cannot be read as
//     the verdict on the install.
