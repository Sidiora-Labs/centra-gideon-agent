// ── The Store showed four of sixteen rail categories as apparent typos, and one raw slug ───────────
//
// Two label defects in one file, both the SAME defect: a machine identifier reaching the eye.
//
// 1. `categoryLabel` sentence-cased every tag, so an ACRONYM tag came out mangled. Measured across all
//    54 shipped manifests: `llm` (16 apps) → **"Llm"**, `acp` (4) → **"Acp"**, `tts` (3) → "Tts",
//    `stt` (2) → "Stt", `onnx` → "Onnx". The Categories rail shows the **16 most common tags**, so
//    four of its sixteen entries read as misspellings. `macos` → "Macos", `gemini-cli` → "Gemini cli"
//    and `kiro-cli` → "Kiro cli" are the same thing on rarer tags.
//
//    🔑 That function's own docstring already says a raw slug in a rail heading "looks like a leaked
//    identifier" — so the acronym case is the defect it was written to prevent, in a form it missed.
//
// 2. `PROVIDER_ENTITY_LABEL` had no `trigger` key, so `shared-automations` (`provider.type: "trigger"`)
//    rendered "**trigger** provider" on its Store card and a bare lowercase "trigger" in the rail
//    facet. 🔑 The comment sitting right above that map records `trigger_source` and `duty_gate` being
//    added for *precisely* this fall-through — so this was the third occurrence of a documented class.
//
// 🪤 THE PER-WORD DESIGN IS LOAD-BEARING. A whole-tag allowlist — the obvious fix — repairs `llm` and
// leaves `gemini-cli` reading "Gemini cli", because there the acronym is the SECOND word.
//
// 🪤 AND THE OUTPUT MUST STAY SENTENCE CASE. Title-casing every word would render `image_gen` as
// "Image Gen", against a house convention measured at 1,122 of 1,130 multi-word labels. Both halves
// are asserted below, because a fix for one that breaks the other is not a fix.
