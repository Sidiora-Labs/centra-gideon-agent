// ── The Sources row's two promises (WATCHED-SOURCES §6.3, §2.3/§12, WS-9) ─────────────
//
// 1. The 'no AI' CHIP IS A READOUT, not decoration. §6.3's guarantee is structural — a raw
//    source's items run through a graph whose LLM nodes are ABSENT — so a chip driven by
//    anything other than the source's real `enrichment` would be a claim the UI invented.
//    The negative case is the one that matters: a chip rendered unconditionally satisfies
//    every "it appears" assertion.
//
// 2. The TWO REMEDIATIONS STAY OPPOSITE. WS-3 measures the discrimination between "you
//    pointed at the wrong URL" (the page rendered plenty of text) and "this page is a
//    JavaScript shell" precisely because the fixes are opposite — a different URL vs. one
//    budget knob. Collapsing them into a single "nothing found" strip would send half the
//    users the wrong way, and every per-case assertion would still pass. So the row is
//    rendered in BOTH states and the two are asserted to differ in message AND in control.
//
// The backend supplies the verdict (`remediation`) and the guidance text; these tests hold
// the row to RENDERING what it is given rather than deciding it locally.
