/** What the skill DECLARES about itself, on the same surface as the Install button and
 *  ABOVE it — so it is read before the click, not after.
 *
 *  🔑 A DECLARATION DISCLOSED AFTER CONSENT IS NOT A DISCLOSURE. `always: true` is
 *  enforced: `SkillsLoader.get_always_skills()` puts the skill's FULL text into every
 *  session, and the INSTALLED surfaces already say so (`SkillInspector`'s "always loaded"
 *  pill, the chip on the installed list). This panel said nothing, so the one declaration
 *  that changes every future conversation reached the user only once they had already
 *  agreed to it. The wire was never the problem — `handlers/skills.py` puts the parsed
 *  frontmatter on the detail payload under the comment "a marketplace preview must show
 *  the same metadata the loader will read once installed, or the consent surface lies".
 *  Nothing read it.
 *
 *  🪤 A SKILL IS NOT AN APP, so this must not read like `PermissionList`. An app's bullets
 *  are grants the gateway ENFORCES; a skill is instructions the agent reads, and
 *  `allowed-tools` has NO enforcement call site in the backend — the only mention is a
 *  docstring in `skills/marketplace.py`. Rendering it as a bounded grant would invert the
 *  `network` defect (#2513 item 1): copy claiming a confinement the platform does not
 *  impose. So the tool line is attributed to the author, and the advisory floor is stated
 *  either way — absence of `allowed-tools` is not a restriction and must never read as one.
 *
 *  🪤 `always` IS PARSED THE WAY THE LOADER PARSES IT, not the way its neighbour does.
 *  Two backend readers disagree: `handlers/skills.py::_parse_always` accepts
 *  true/yes/1, while `loader.get_always_skills()` — the one that actually performs the
 *  injection — accepts only `"true"`. Mirroring the looser reader would promise
 *  always-on for a `always: yes` skill the loader will not load always. */
