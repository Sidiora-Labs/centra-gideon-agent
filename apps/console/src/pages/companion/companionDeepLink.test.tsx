// ── `#/companion?approval=<id>` — where a push tap lands (MOBILE-COMPANION MC-5 / T3.4) ──
//
// The milestone is "a locked phone rings, you tap, and THE CARD YOU WERE PINGED ABOUT is in
// front of you". A tap that lands on an unsorted queue is a different, worse product: the
// user scans while the run stays blocked, which is the latency this whole atom exists to
// remove.
//
// Two halves, and the second is the one that gets forgotten:
//   1. the addressed card is found, scrolled to, focused and visibly marked;
//   2. an id that is NO LONGER pending SAYS SO. An approval can time out while the phone is
//      in a pocket, or be answered at the desk. Rendering the ordinary queue with no
//      explanation reads as "the notification opened the wrong thing", and the user goes
//      hunting for a card that does not exist.
//
// Focus lands on the CARD, not on Allow. A phone that just woke up in a pocket with focus
// on an irreversible grant is one stray Enter from an unintended approval.
