/** `#/companion` — the phone control surface, approvals first.
 *
 *  A run that is blocked on a permission decision is the one thing that genuinely cannot wait
 *  until the owner is back at a desk, so the phone route ships that decision FIRST and by
 *  itself and stays at the TOP of the column. `MC-6` adds the rest of the attention path
 *  underneath it — running loops, tasks, inbox, recent notifications — in
 *  `CompanionSections.tsx`; the ordering is the priority order and is not negotiable, because
 *  a blocked run is the only row on this page that another person is waiting on.
 *
 *  No NavRail, no shell chrome: App.tsx returns this route full-screen (like `#/onboarding`)
 *  so the whole viewport belongs to the decision. It is a normal hash route, so the URL
 *  doctrine holds — `#/companion` is addressable, bookmarkable, and installable as a phone
 *  start_url, and per-approval focus will ride `?approval=<id>` when push lands.
 *
 *  Reachable at any width on purpose. `useIsMobile` is a `max-width` media query, not a touch
 *  test, so gating the route on it would make the surface undebuggable from a desktop browser
 *  and would still be wrong for a tablet or a keyboard-only phone user. The layout is a
 *  single centered column that simply reads well narrow.
