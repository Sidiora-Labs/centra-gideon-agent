// ── A destructive dialog's body is a CLAIM about the backend ────────────────────────────────────
//
// #1603 made every danger dialog carry a body; #1608 made every `confirmDelete` name its subject.
// Neither asked the next question: **is the body TRUE?** Two were checked against the handlers that
// implement them, and both were materially incomplete — not wrong, just quiet about the part a user
// cannot see:
//
//   tasks/TaskDetail        "Delete this task?" / "This cannot be undone." — the ONLY destructive
//                           dialog in the app whose subject appears in NEITHER its title nor its body
//                           (the seven other hand-rolled ones all interpolate theirs), and it omitted
//                           that deleting a prerequisite UNBLOCKS whatever was waiting on it.
//   knowledge/KnowledgeDetail  "This removes it from the knowledge base." — which is the one thing a
//                           user already knows from pressing Delete. It also takes their HIGHLIGHTS
//                           (the only content on that surface they wrote) and the FILE stored in the
//                           library.
//
// 🔑 SO THIS RAIL READS THE PYTHON. A body that describes behaviour has to fail when the behaviour
// changes, or it decays into confident fiction. (Three other web tests already read the backend
// source, so the idiom is the repo's own, not an invention here.)
