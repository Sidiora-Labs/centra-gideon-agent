/**
 * "Sharing your screen" — the in-app half of the honest-signalling pair (§5.2).
 *
 * Two indicators are lit while a screen is shared and BOTH matter:
 *
 * 1. The **browser's own** capture indicator (tab badge, OS overlay, the floating
 *    "Stop sharing" bar). That one the app cannot draw, suppress, or fake, which is
 *    exactly why it is the trustworthy one.
 * 2. **This chip.** It says which Gideon chat is receiving the frames, which
 *    the browser indicator cannot — the browser knows a page is capturing, not that
 *    a particular conversation will be shown a frame on your next message.
 *
 * So this is an addition to the browser's signal, never a substitute for it. It is
 * mounted from the live stream's state (not from a "user pressed share" flag), so it
 * disappears the moment the track ends however it ended — including via the browser's
 * own stop button. A chip that outlived its stream would be worse than no chip.
 *
 * Clicking it stops sharing: the visible indicator is also the off switch, so a user
 * who notices the chip never has to hunt for the control that clears it.
