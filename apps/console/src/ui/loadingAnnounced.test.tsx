// ── A live region with no text announces nothing, however well it is marked up ────────────────────
//
// Cycle 142 could not drive this lens and recorded it as UNMEASURED rather than passing. Driven here
// properly — a fresh context per route (cold `sessionStorage`), every `/api/**` response held back,
// and a 150ms poll for the FIRST frame at which a skeleton exists:
//
//   surface        before                                          after
//   #/tasks        region present, aria-label="Loading", SPOKEN=[]  SPOKEN=["Loading…"]
//   #/knowledge    region present, aria-label="Loading", SPOKEN=[]  SPOKEN=["Loading…"]
//   #/artifacts    no skeleton rendered in this dev home            —
//   settings/apps  no skeleton rendered in this dev home            —
//
// 🔑 THE MARKUP WAS ALREADY RIGHT, WHICH IS WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT. `role="status" aria-busy="true"
// aria-label="Loading"` passes every rule axe has. But a live region is announced by its CONTENT
// changing, and the content was styled `<div>`s with no text — an `aria-label` is a NAME, not an
// announcement. Perfectly marked up, entirely silent, from the first frame to the moment data arrived.
//
// 🔑 AND THE RESULT-COUNT STATUS DOES NOT COVER IT. `ui/ListControls`' ResultAnnouncement speaks only
// while a query or filter narrows — deliberately, because cycle 121 fixed the opposite defect (an idle
// surface announcing "39 items" unprompted). So a cold first load announced nothing before OR after.
//
// 🪤 ONE CLAIM DIED ON RE-MEASUREMENT. A 4s-per-request hold left an `aria-busy` region up AFTER the
// list had arrived, which looked like a stale-busy lie. With a 1.2s hold it was gone, and with no
// interception at all there were ZERO busy regions 4s after load: the "stale" region was a
// second-wave request still in flight, i.e. an artifact of the probe's own throttle.
//
// 🪤 `#/settings/apps` CARRIED `aria-busy` ON THREE SECTIONS WITH NO ROLE AND NO NAME — not a live
// region at all, and unfindable. It is one region now.
//
// 🪤 CYCLE 144 FOUND THE HOLE IN THIS VERY CENSUS. It keyed on `aria-busy="true"`, and `ui/Loading` —
// the app's OTHER loading state, 6 call sites — is a bare text `<div>` with no `aria-busy` and no role,
// so the ratchet never looked at it. Measured mid-load on `#/workflows`: "Loading…" visible for 2.8
// seconds, `SPOKEN=[]`. **A census that keys on one mechanism cannot see a second one.** Both are
// checked below, and `Loading` needs no sr-only twin — its text is already visible, so `role="status"`
// makes the words a sighted user reads the words everyone hears.
