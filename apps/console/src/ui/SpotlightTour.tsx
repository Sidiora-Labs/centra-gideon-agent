 *  It is a modal dialog and behaves like one, because the page underneath is dimmed:
 *  focus is trapped in the card and re-taken on every step (a navigating tour lands on
 *  surfaces that autofocus their own fields — Settings' search does — and without this
 *  the trap would be left holding nothing). Escape exits from any step — but only while the
 *  tour holds focus, so a layer opened ABOVE it (the Cmd+K palette rides `--z-toast`, above
 *  this overlay's `--z-modal`) closes on the first press instead of the tour underneath. A click anywhere
 *  outside the card exits too: the whole overlay sits on ONE transparent shield, so
 *  that click ends the tour instead of silently actioning a control the dim layer was
 *  covering. Nothing in the tour navigates or writes on its own — the host owns both.
 *
 *  Reduced motion is honoured as an ABSENCE, not a slower animation: no pulsing halo
 *  around the ring, no card transition between stops, and the anchor is jumped into
 *  view rather than smooth-scrolled.
 *
 *  A stop whose anchor is missing (or scrolled entirely out of the viewport — the
 *  mobile nav drawer parks off-screen) keeps its card, centred, with no ring: the copy
 *  still teaches, and the overlay reports `data-tour-anchored="false"` so a test can
 *  tell a resolved stop from a degraded one. */

  // reasoning here was "the tour is the topmost layer", which is false: this overlay rides
  // `--z-modal` and `app/CommandPalette` rides `--z-toast` (higher), so Cmd+K opens a palette ABOVE the tour
  // and takes focus — by design, because guidance never gates. The tour binds on `document`
  // and the palette on `window`, and `document` fires FIRST in the bubble path, so consuming
  // unconditionally swallowed the key before the focused layer ever saw it. Measured: with the
  // palette open and focused, one Escape closed the TOUR and left the palette up and focused;
  // a second closed the palette. Without the tour, that same press closes the palette.
  //
  // Deferring when focus sits in another layer restores the ordering with no layer registry:
