/** Eyebrow — the one canonical caption-tier micro-label.

 *  variable-weight STEP, never uppercase-with-tracking. Section eyebrows, chip
 *  labels and meta tags across the app had drifted to
 *  `text-[0.75rem] uppercase tracking-wide` — the exact Don't the rule names.
 *  This renders the intended treatment instead: the `caption` type role
 *  (0.75rem / `wght` 470, `tokens.css`) in sentence case, tinted
 *  `--color-on-surface-low` by default. Migrate
 *  `<div className="… text-[0.75rem] uppercase tracking-wide">Label</div>` to
 *  `<Eyebrow>Label</Eyebrow>` (drop the size — the role sets it — and keep only
 *  layout/margin utilities). The `eyebrowWeightRole` ratchet
 *  (`design/eyebrowWeightRole.test.ts`) holds the remaining uppercase-tracked
 *  count down so it can only shrink. */
