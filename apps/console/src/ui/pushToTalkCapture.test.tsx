/**
 * DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES S3 — push-to-talk capture, driven end to end through the real
 * `Composer` with the microphone and the desktop bridge faked at the boundary.
 *
 * ## What is real here and what is not
 *
 * REAL: the whole renderer path. A chord push travels through `usePushToTalk` into the
 * live `useMicRecorder`, opens a (fake) stream, records (fake) chunks, uploads through
 * the host's `onTranscribe`, and the transcript is inserted into the actual composer
 * input. The assertions below are made against the objects the production code touched,
 * not against a re-implementation of it.
 *
 * NOT REAL, and not claimed to be:
 *  - **The chord itself.** `globalShortcut` lives in the Electron main process. Nothing
 *    here presses a key on macOS; the push is injected at the bridge boundary, exactly
 *    as `preload.js` would deliver it. That the OS hands us the chord is V3's job and has
 *    not been performed.
 *  - **TCC.** The grant is a stub. A real permission dialog has never been raised by this
 *    code.
 *  - **A microphone.** jsdom implements neither `getUserMedia` nor `MediaRecorder`, so
 *    both are fakes. What IS therefore worth asserting is the thing a fake can prove
 *    honestly: that `stop()` is called on every track the code was handed.
 *
 * The privacy clause ("captures only while held/toggled") is checked as a claim about
 * TRACKS, never about a flag: a boolean flipping to false while a track stays live is the
 * precise defect the clause exists to prevent, and only the track spies can tell the
 * difference.
