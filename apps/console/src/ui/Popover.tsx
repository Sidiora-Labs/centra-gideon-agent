  // ── Portaled mode only: move focus INTO the flyout on open ───────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // 🔑 THE PORTAL SILENTLY CHANGED THE KEYBOARD CONTRACT. `portal` was added to fix CLIPPING — a
  // visual problem — but `createPortal(flyout, document.body)` appends the menu after the entire
  // `#root` subtree, so it stops being the trigger's DOM neighbour. Sequential focus order follows
  // DOM order, so Tab from the trigger went to the next control ON THE PAGE and straight past the
  // open menu: the flyout floated over the transcript while focus walked along behind it, and
  // nothing dismissed on Tab either. Ten portaled call sites were not keyboard-operable, including
  // the composer's PERMISSION MODE pill, which governs what the agent may do without asking.
  //
  // 🪤 THE PROJECT ALREADY DIAGNOSED THIS EXACT MECHANISM AND THE RAIL STILL COULD NOT SEE IT.
  // `lib/menuCursorAdoption.test.tsx` records the portaled HeaderModePill's "four mode options were
  // unreachable in practice", and the fix landed as `useMenuCursor`. But that rail's scan key is
  // `role="menu"|"listbox"`, and these flyouts are deliberately ROLE-LESS (`ui/popupItemRoles.test.tsx`:
  // a bare button is correct in a role-less popover). The scan key is narrower than the defect shape —
  // THE DEFECT IS CAUSED BY PORTALING, NOT BY DECLARING A ROLE. `ui/Segmented` is portaled too and is
  // correctly exempt precisely because it declares a role and adopts the hook.
  //
  // Borrowed rather than re-spelled: this is `lib/useMenuCursor.ts`'s autoFocus effect, down to
  // `{ preventScroll: true }` — which is load-bearing here, not decorative. The flyout is
  // `position: fixed`, and focusing into it without that flag can scroll an ancestor, which trips the
  // capture-phase scroll handler below and closes the menu in the same frame it opened.
  //
  // Keyed on `anchor`, not just `open`: an `openSignal`-forced open sets the anchor in a LATER commit
  // (see the effect above), so the flyout does not exist yet on the `open` render. `[open, portal,
  // anchor]` is the dep set the measure-nudge effect already proved means "the flyout is mounted".
  //
  // Inline mode is UNTOUCHED — its flyout already is the trigger's next sibling, so Tab reaches it.
  //
  // 🪤 AND IT MUST STAND DOWN FOR A POPUP THAT OWNS ITS OWN KEYBOARD, or it breaks the one portaled
  // call site that was already correct. `ui/Segmented` renders a `role="listbox"` child that adopts
  // `useMenuCursor` with `initialIndex` = the SELECTED option. Child effects run BEFORE parent
  // effects, so an unconditional focus-in here would land after the cursor's and move focus from the
  // selected option to the FIRST one — reintroducing verbatim the defect `useMenuCursor` records
  // measuring ("one ArrowDown from a trigger showing 'Agent' focused 'Ask'"). Guarding on `portal`
  // alone is therefore NOT sufficient.
  //
  // The discriminator is the container role, which is deliberately the SAME key
  // `lib/menuCursorAdoption.test.tsx` scans on. So the two mechanisms partition the popups on one
  // axis rather than two overlapping ones, and any future popover that adopts a role + the hook opts
  // out of this automatically instead of having to be remembered here.
  /** True when the flyout declares a popup container role, i.e. it adopts `useMenuCursor` and owns
   *  its own focus entry and Tab handling. Both behaviours below stand down for it, so exactly one
   *  mechanism governs each popup rather than two racing to set focus.
   *
   *  🪤 READS THE ATTRIBUTE INSTEAD OF MATCHING A `[role="menu"]` SELECTOR STRING, DELIBERATELY.
   *  `lib/menuCursorAdoption.test.tsx` builds its population by scanning source for
   *  `role="(menu|listbox)"`, and a CSS selector containing that text is indistinguishable from a
   *  JSX attribute declaring it — so the literal form enrolled this file in the adopters census and
   *  reded two of its assertions, demanding `Popover` route arrows through `menuCursorKeydown`. That
   *  was the scanner reading a QUERY as a DECLARATION. Re-quoting to `[role='menu']` would have
   *  dodged the regex while leaving the same ambiguity for the next reader; naming the values in an
   *  array says what this actually is. */
