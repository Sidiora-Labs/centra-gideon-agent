// ── Filtering a list changed the page and said nothing ───────────────────────────────
//
// Typing in a list filter rewrites the page under the user. The sighted cue is the list
// redrawing; for a screen-reader user there was no cue at all. Measured on six surfaces
// (knowledge, prompts, triggers, apps, skills, projects) — filtering 26 rows to 25, and
// filtering to a "No matching items" empty state — **zero live regions, every time**:
//
//   knowledge   noMatchShown=true   liveRegions=[]   NOT ANNOUNCED
//   prompts     noMatchShown=true   liveRegions=[]   NOT ANNOUNCED
//   …6 of 6
//
// axe reports nothing here, as in cycle 52: a missing announcement is not a rule violation.
//
// 🔑 THE CANONICAL FORM ALREADY EXISTED — `pages/chat/FindBar.tsx` announces its match count
// with `aria-live="polite"` on the `n/total` counter. This brings the 13 `ListControls`
// consumers onto that pattern instead of inventing one.
//
// ── The three that could not adopt it, and now can ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The coherence `layout` lens flagged `tasks`, `artifacts` and `files` as `ListControls`
// non-adopters. They are: each lays out its own controls bar and uses `SearchField` directly, so
// the announcement lived somewhere they could not reach. Re-measured with a probe that types into
// each list's own filter and diffs every live region, against `#/knowledge` as a KNOWN-adopter
// control (which proves the probe can see an announcement at all):
//
//   #/knowledge   "" → "No matching items"    ✅ announced   ← control
//   #/tasks       "" → ""                     🔴 silent
//   #/artifacts   "" → ""                     🔴 silent
//   #/files       "" → ""                     🔴 silent
//
// 🔑 SO THE FIX IS AN EXTRACTION, NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. `ResultAnnouncement` is the region
// `ListControls` always rendered, lifted out and exported beside it; `ListControls` now renders the
// extracted piece, and the three hand-laid bars render the same one. Migrate the IDIOM, not the page
// — copying the markup into three files is what turns one shared behaviour into four that drift.
//
// After, driven the same way: `"No matching tasks"` · `"No matching artifacts"` ·
// `"No matching lines"`.
//
// 🪤 THE NOUN IS PART OF THE COPY, AND `files` GOT IT WRONG FIRST: `noun="matches"` made the zero
// branch read **"No matching matches"**. A `ContentMatch` is one matching LINE (file + line + col +
// preview), so the honest noun is "lines" — which also reads correctly at 1 ("1 line").
//
// Verified live after the change:
//
//   idle                  ""                      (region MOUNTED, empty)
//   no match              "No matching items"
//   25 of 26 rows         "25 items"
//   1 row                 "1 item"                (singularised)
//   query cleared         ""
