// ── Escape must close the layer that HAS focus, not the one underneath ────────────────────────
//
// Measured in Chromium against the real shell, tour launched from `#/discover`:
//
//   palette open + focused, tour behind → ONE Escape closed the TOUR, palette stayed up and
//                                          focused; a SECOND Escape closed the palette
//   palette open, no tour               → ONE Escape closed the palette (the control case)
//
// So the tour was eating a key pressed at a layer above it. The mechanism is ordering, not
// intent: `SpotlightTour` binds `keydown` on `document` and `app/CommandPalette` binds it on
// `window`, and `document` fires FIRST in the bubble path — so an unconditional
// `stopPropagation()` here consumed the press before the palette ever saw it.
//
// 🔑 THE PREMISE IN THE ORIGINAL COMMENT WAS THE BUG: "the tour is the topmost layer". It is
// not. This overlay rides `--z-modal`; the command palette rides `--z-toast` (higher), and it is *supposed* to open
// over the tour — the tour's own doctrine is that guidance never gates. Two true statements
// ("consume Escape so one press closes one layer" and "the tour is topmost") were combined, and
// only the first one holds.
//
// The guard is "does the tour hold focus", which needs no layer registry: whoever owns focus
// owns the key. Focus on `<body>` still counts as the tour's — the trap takes focus on mount and
// re-takes it on every stop, so an unfocused document means nothing else has claimed it and the
// tour must stay dismissable.
