// ── `role="separator"` on a resize handle is the window-splitter promise ───────────────────────
//
// The APG splitter is a role PLUS a keyboard contract: arrow keys move it, and it reports where it
// sits (`aria-valuenow` within min/max). `ui/NavRail` declared the role and implemented none of it —
// measured before the fix: `tabindex` null, no key handler, no `aria-valuenow`, no accessible name.
// So the rail could only be resized by dragging a 1px strip with a mouse (WCAG 2.1.1, and 2.5.7 for
// the drag-only gesture) while announcing itself as a control that does none of that. Same shape as
// `aria-modal` without a trap and `aria-haspopup` with no popup: a declaration nothing stands behind.
//
// 🔑 THE CANONICAL FORM WAS ALREADY IN THE TREE — as a HOOK, `ui/useResizablePanel`. It carries the
// whole splitter: pointer-drag with pointer CAPTURE (so a drag crossing an iframe/editor can't stick),
// arrow/Home/End keyboard resize, and persisted size. `pages/code/CodeCockpitPage.tsx` uses it for its
// panel splitter and terminal drawer; `ui/NavRail` and `ui/SidePanel` converged onto it rather than
// each re-deriving the keyboard math. The hook was moved out of `pages/code/` into `ui/` for exactly
// this reason — a page-private hook cannot be a shared primitive.
//
// ── The rest of the family, recorded rather than silently left ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Six drag-to-resize handles exist. This rail governs the ones that CLAIM to be splitters; the others
// are pointer-only and do not lie about it, which is a smaller defect but still one:
//
//   pages/code/CodeCockpitPage  ×2   full pattern (via the hook)   ← canonical
//   ui/NavRail                       full pattern                  ← cycle 189 (inline, its own state)
//   ui/SidePanel                     full pattern (via the hook)   ← cycle 190
//   pages/chat/ChatFilePanel         full pattern (via the hook)   ← cycle 191
//   pages/terminal/TerminalDrawer    full pattern (via the hook)   ← this change
//   ui/Composer                      pointer-only  ← the last one, deferred on a TASTE CALL
//
// 🪤 ONLY `ui/Composer` REMAINS POINTER-ONLY, and it is deferred for a reason that is not the hook's to
// settle: its handle sits directly above the primary chat input, so making it a focusable splitter puts
// a tab stop in front of the app's most-used control. That is an owner taste call — weakened further
// because the textarea already auto-grows with content, so keyboard resize is a convenience there, not
// an access necessity. (Its key `composer-resth2` also lacks the `-w` suffix, but the hook's
// `storageKey` override — added for the terminal drawer — already solves that half.) Failing it today
// would invite the cheap fix of DELETING a role to go green. What the rail guarantees is that nobody can
// ship the NavRail defect again: claiming the role obliges the contract.
//
// TerminalDrawer was the adopter that justified the hook's two generalisations — a `max` thunk (its
// ceiling is `innerHeight × MAX_FRAC`) and a `storageKey` override (its `terminal-drawer-h` key predates
// the `-w` convention). Both are real, used-now capabilities, not speculative API.
