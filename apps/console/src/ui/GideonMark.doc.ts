  description:
    'The Gideon brand mark — the gideon silhouette painted with the ACTIVE scheme\'s gradient (reads --grad-1..4, re-tinted per scheme by the appearance store), so the logo tracks Coral/Jade/Lavender/etc. and any custom fork automatically. An optional `blob` halo wraps it in a soft scheme-tinted shape that slowly morphs its border-radius through organic keyframes for the "liquid / alive" thinking feel.',
  props: [
    { name: 'animated', description: 'Adds a slow ambient rotate wobble to the mark; suppressed under prefers-reduced-motion.' },
    { name: 'blob', description: 'Wraps the mark in a soft, scheme-tinted radial halo that morphs its border-radius through organic keyframes — for the large thinking indicator, not tiny inline lockups.' },
    { name: 'idGradient', description: "SVG gradient element id (default 'gideon-grad'). Give co-existing instances distinct ids so their linearGradient defs never collide." },
    { name: 'size', description: 'Pixel width/height of the square mark (default 24); the blob padding scales with it.' },
