/** The layered surface overlay (AMBIENT-SURFACES §6) — L0 / L1 / L2 + safe mode.
 *
 *  Once agents can generate UI, the failure to prevent is an agent-rewritten surface
 *  bricking the app. The overlay makes that structurally impossible by naming which
 *  layer a surface came from and giving the recovery route to the layer nothing can
 *  touch:
 *
 *    L0 — CORE: the shipped `web/dist` bundle. Immutable at runtime; the build owns it.
 *    L1 — APP: app-contributed pages + genui components, loaded through the appSdk
 *         host map, removable by disabling the app.
 *    L2 — USER/AGENT: user-customized or agent-rewritten surface overrides.
 *
 *  Resolution is replace-vs-compose per surface kind: component registrations COMPOSE
 *  (a higher layer may ADD, never SHADOW a lower layer's name — refused at register
 *  time), while skins/skeletons REPLACE (highest layer wins).
 *
 *  Safe mode forces `maxLayer = 0` — pure L0, no app modules, no overlays. Two ways
 *  in, deliberately: `#/dashboard?safe=1` (the URL a user can be told over the phone)
 *  and the `--safe-surfaces` gateway flag (the one that survives a client that cannot
 *  render its own address bar). Because L0 is immutable and the safe route is part of
 *  L0, the recovery path never routes through anything an agent can touch. */
