/** The L2 overlay loader — the client half of the user/agent surface producer.
 *
 *  AMBIENT-SURFACES §6 declared three layers and shipped the ceiling, the boundary and
 *  the refusals for all three; until this module NOTHING wrote an L2 overlay, so the layer
 *  was declared and empty. The backend half (`gideon/surface_overlay.py`) carries
 *  the full threat posture in its docstring and owns path containment + the DATA shape.
 *  This module owns the two clauses that can only be checked where the registry lives:
 *
 *  * **Clause 2 — an unknown component name is REFUSED at load.** Note the deliberate
 *    difference from the chat path: `GenUiWidget` DROPS one bad line so the rest of a
 *    model's answer still paints, because a transcript is disposable. An overlay is a
 *    saved artifact someone authored on purpose, so half of it rendering is worse than a
 *    named refusal — one bad node refuses the WHOLE overlay and names the component.
 *  * **Clause 3 — shadowing is refused through the SAME `registerLayerComponent`** an
 *    app's L1 module uses. One rule, both producers, one code path. An overlay's
 *    `define` entries are the only way it can shadow anything, which is what keeps that
 *    rule from being vacuous.
 *
 *  Clause 4 (props are host-schema validated) is `validateInvocation`, the same function
 *  the chat renderer calls. Clause 6: safe mode (`maxSurfaceLayer() === 0`) returns before
 *  the fetch, so an operator in recovery loads no overlay at all — and even if one
 *  somehow arrived, `registerLayerComponent` refuses every L2 name under the ceiling.
 *
 *  A `define`d composite takes NO args (substituting a caller's value into a saved
 *  sub-tree is an expression language, which clause 1 refuses), so it declares `args: []`
 *  and `validateInvocation` reports any arg passed to it as `excess-args`. */
