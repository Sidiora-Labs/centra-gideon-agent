/** AS-8 — which attention lane an item belongs to, as a pure function over the wire types.
 *
 *  Mission Control renders four lanes (Needs-approval / Your-turn / Working / Idle). This module
 *  owns the RULE; the component owns the pixels. Split out deliberately: lane assignment is the part
 *  most likely to be subtly wrong, and a wrong lane is invisible in a screenshot — everything still
 *  renders, just in the wrong column, with counts that read as authoritative.
 *
 *  ── THE THREE MEASURED FACTS THIS RULE RESTS ON ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. **`inbox.py` already partitions the kinds; this file does not invent a third partition.**
 *     `ItemKind` (inbox.py:69) is exactly eight members. Two frozensets sit right below it:
 *     `NON_CHANNEL_KINDS` = {agent_request, proposal, needs_input, digest, system} — core's own
 *     attention vocabulary, raised only through `emit_attention_item` with the `refs` that make a row
 *     actionable — and `SOURCE_DECLARABLE_KINDS` = {message, mention, email}, the channel-shaped
 *     kinds a message source may claim. `BASE_LANE` below is keyed off that same split: the three
 *     channel-shaped kinds map to `null`, the five attention kinds map to a lane.
 *
 *  2. **A pending approval already appears TWICE on the wire, so a naive concat double-counts it.**
 *     `chat_runner._mirror_approval_to_inbox()` raises an `agent_request` item carrying
 *     `refs = {session, approval: <request_id>}` for any approval that outlives its prompt — and
 *     `PendingApproval.id` IS that `request_id`. So one blocked decision is one row in
 *     `GET /api/approvals` and a second row in `GET /api/inbox`. `toLanes` suppresses the mirror
 *     when its `refs.approval` matches an approval in the same snapshot. This is not a hypothetical
 *     precedence puzzle; it is the shipped behaviour of the two endpoints Mission Control reads.
 *
 *  3. **🔴 "Working" is NOT derivable from the attention store. Nothing in the inbox says
 *     "in flight".** `ItemStatus`'s own docstring (inbox.py:49) declares the lifecycle as
 *     `PENDING → SEEN → HANDLED | DISMISSED` — two open states, two closed ones, and no in-flight
 *     one. The nearest candidate, `SENT`, measures as an **enum member nobody writes**: a census of
 *     `src/gideon/` finds `ItemStatus.SENT` assigned at zero sites (the only hits are its own
 *     declaration and the comment conceding it "predates the others"). Keying the Working lane off
 *     `sent` would have produced a permanently empty lane wearing a confident label.
 *     `PendingApproval` carries no status at all — being in the list IS pending.
 *
 *     So Working is fed from a THIRD source that actually observes running work: `ChatSession`
 *     (`GET /api/chat/sessions`), whose `running`/`stopping` booleans are real evidence. It is an
 *     optional argument, so `toLanes(items, approvals)` stays valid; pass nothing and Working is
 *     honestly empty rather than filled by a timestamp heuristic. **`laneFor` never returns
 *     `'working'`** — no single inbox item can prove it, and `laneFor` only sees inbox items.
 *
 *  ── THE TWO `null`s, AND WHY UNKNOWN IS NOT `idle` ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  `laneFor` returns `null` for "not on this surface", which covers three distinct cases: a
 *  channel-shaped kind (a different concern — those belong to the inbox proper, with reply
 *  machinery), a closed item, and an unrecognised kind. **An unrecognised kind must not land in
 *  `idle`.** `idle` is a real lane that reads to a user as "nothing is needed from you"; quietly
 *  routing a kind this build has never heard of into it would state the one thing we cannot know.
 *  Use `isKnownKind()` to tell the unknown `null` from the deliberate ones.
 *
 *  🪤 The two unknowns fail in OPPOSITE directions, on purpose. An unknown **kind** fails closed
 *  (off-surface): we cannot say what it wants, so we refuse to claim. An unknown or missing
 *  **status** fails open (still asking): the question is only "is this resolved?", and an unresolved
 *  item wrongly hidden is a worse failure on an attention surface than a resolved item wrongly
 *  shown. Neither is a fallthrough — both branches are written out.
