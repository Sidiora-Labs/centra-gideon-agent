/** The ONE vocabulary for "this fact was never recorded", on the page side.
 *
 *  The Python half is `src/gideon/evals/provenance.py`; this is its twin, and
 *  `tests/test_evals_unrecorded_vocabulary.py` reds if the two spell the word differently. Not
 *  generated from it: a code generator for one string and one comparison would be more moving
 *  parts than the rail it replaces.
 *
 *  **The word is `unrecorded`.** Not `priced` — that word already exists in `loop_spend`,
 *  `usage_ledger` and `run_totals` and means precisely "a cost is unknown". #2630 ruled it must
 *  not be widened to cover token counts, because a row with a known cost and an unknown token
 *  count would have to pick one value and either choice lies to one of its two readers.
 *
 *  **Three states**, and collapsing any two re-creates the defect this module exists for:
 *
 *  1. RECORDED — the fact is known and has a value;
 *  2. RECORDED-NONE — the fact is known and its value is nothing (`null`, `{}`, a genuine `0`).
 *     This is a MEASUREMENT;
 *  3. UNRECORDED — the fact was never recorded. Not a weaker measurement: not one.
