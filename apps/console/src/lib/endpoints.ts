/** Multi-gateway endpoint registry + per-endpoint storage namespacing (COMPANION-APPS T3.1/T3.3).
 *
 * A companion shell (desktop today, mobile next) holds N *paired gateways* — N independent
 * Gideon brains — and a switcher that re-points `active` and reloads the same served SPA
 * from the new origin. This module owns the registry shape and, more importantly, the one
 * mechanism that keeps two brains from bleeding into each other.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY THIS LIVES IN THE SHELL'S STORAGE SCOPE, NOT THE SPA'S. The served SPA cannot hold this
 * registry, for two independently sufficient reasons, both measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *   1. The SPA is re-downloaded from whichever gateway is active. `desktop/main.js:1246` does
 *      `wc.loadURL(localGatewayUrl)` and `connectMode`'s `navigateToEndpoint` does the same for a
 *      paired gateway's origin — either way the shell loads the dashboard *from that gateway's own
 *      origin*. A registry of N gateways has nowhere to live in a bundle that is itself one of the N.
 *      (Since `CA-8` the shell holds TWO url variables, not one: `localGatewayUrl`
 *      (`desktop/main.js:204`, resolved from the spawned gateway's READY line) and `activeUrl`, what
 *      the WebView is actually pointed at. Every credential-bearing call is bound to the first;
 *      only the second ever becomes a gateway this shell did not spawn.)
 *   2. The SPA's storage is ALREADY partitioned, for free, by browser origin. `grep -n partition`
 *      over `desktop/main.js` finds nothing, so the default session partition applies and
 *      per-origin isolation holds. Nothing in the SPA reaches across gateways either:
 *      `useChatSocket.ts:32` opens `${proto}://${location.host}/api/ws` — origin-relative — and
 *      `lib/api.ts` uses relative URLs only (it has no `base_url`/`API_BASE` at all).
 *
 * So the ONLY storage scope that spans all N gateways is the shell's own. That is precisely where
 * bleed is possible, and therefore the only place namespacing is load-bearing. This module is what
 * desktop (T4.1) and mobile import so that neither re-decides the key format — two shells that
 * disagree about the format are two shells that cannot share a registry.
 *
 * Desktop's consumer is `desktop/endpointRegistry.js`, a PORT rather than an import: `desktop/` is
 * plain CommonJS with no build step, so it cannot load this `.ts`. It is held to this file by a
 * DIFFERENTIAL rail — `desktop/test/endpointRegistry.test.js` imports this module for real (Node
 * strips the types) and requires byte-identical output from both implementations over a shared
 * vector table, so a behavioural divergence reds even when the two sides' spellings agree.
 *
 * 🚫 NO HUB, NO GATEWAY-TO-GATEWAY. N endpoints are N client-side rows. Gateways never learn about
 * each other; the client fans out. (The multi-instance hub is permanently vetoed.)

 * That rule is about a **WebView**: it loads the served SPA, and the SPA's own socket is
 * origin-relative (`useChatSocket.ts` builds `${proto}://${location.host}/api/ws`), so a shell
 * that also prepends would produce a second, wrong URL. A **native** client has no document and
 * therefore no `location` to be relative to — it has only the string in the registry row. So it
 * must build the URL, and building it in one shared place is the difference between one
 * implementation and one per platform.
 *
 * 🔑 THE SCHEME MAP IS THE WHOLE POINT. `https:` → `wss:` and `http:` → `ws:`. Getting this wrong
 * is not a cosmetic bug: opening `ws://` against a TLS-terminating tunnel fails the handshake,
 * and opening `wss://` against a plain-http LAN gateway fails it the other way. Because the map
 * is derived from the endpoint's OWN scheme, a `remote` row reached over the owner's tunnel gets
 * `wss://` automatically — nothing has to remember that remote implies TLS.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` — never a guess — when `base_url` is unparseable or carries a scheme that
 * is not http/https. A `file:`, `data:` or bare-host row is a broken registry entry, and a
 * shell that gets `undefined` can say "this endpoint is misconfigured" on that row. Coercing it
 * would produce a socket that dials somewhere unintended, which is strictly worse than a refusal.
 *
 * The URL carries no credential: the device session rides as the session cookie, which is why
 * the companion guide forbids the `?token=` query parameter (it IP-binds and a phone changes IP).
