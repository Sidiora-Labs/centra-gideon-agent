/** The keyboard contract shared by the app's two context menus: **the cursor IS focus.**
 *
 *  Both menus already tracked a highlighted row in React state and painted it (heavier label
 *  weight + a trailing primary dot). Measured on the shared row menu before this hook existed,
 *  with the menu open on `#/inbox`: ArrowDown moved the paint (`wght 500` from row 0 to row 1,
 *  the dot with it) while `document.activeElement` stayed on the row BEHIND the menu the whole
 *  time — so the cursor existed only for people who could see it. axe reported **0 violations**
 *  on that open menu, because role, name and children were all correct; the missing part was the
 *  cursor's exposure, which no automated rule can ask about.
 *
 *  Moving real focus is what `ui/Popover` — the canonical popup in this kit — already does
 *  ("restores focus to the trigger on Escape/selection, so keyboard focus isn't dropped to
 *  <body>"), so this converges the two context menus onto the kit's own contract rather than
 *  inventing one. Focus, unlike a font weight:
 *    • is announced ("Open, menu item, 1 of 2"),
 *    • draws the focus ring, so sighted keyboard users see the cursor too,
 *    • activates on Enter/Space natively, with no parallel key handler to keep in sync,
 *    • collapses the menu's tab stops to ONE (roving tabindex), instead of leaving every row a
 *      stray tab stop at the end of the document.
 *
 *  Usage: give the container a ref, mark the rows `role="menuitem"`, spread `tabIndexFor(i)`,
 *  route Arrow keys to `move(±1)`, and call `restoreFocus()` on the Escape and selection paths
 *  (NOT on outside-click — the pointer is already elsewhere, mirroring Popover's split).
