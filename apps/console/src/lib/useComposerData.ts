/** Loads the real agent/model option lists the composer pickers need (native
 *  installed agents + ACP-discovered agents + providers + models). The ACP
 *  discovery loop is shared with the agent catalog via `loadAcpDiscovered`.
 *  Degrades gracefully (empty lists) if the backend isn't reachable.
 *
 *  🔑 "Degrades to an empty list" is only safe for a consumer that RENDERS
 *  nothing. It is NOT safe for one that renders a SENTENCE about the empty list.
 *  `Promise.allSettled` sets `ready` even when a leg rejected, so a failed
 *  `api.agents()` used to be indistinguishable from a genuinely empty roster —
 *  and the agent picker read that as "No agents available", asserting the user
 *  has no agents installed when in truth nothing had been read. `agentsErr`
 *  exists so the picker can tell the two apart; see `AgentPill` in
 *  `ui/composer/controls.tsx`. The models legs need no equivalent: neither model
 *  path states an emptiness (see that file's branch table). */
