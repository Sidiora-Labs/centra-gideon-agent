// ── One collection, two namespaces, and a bust that could only ever reach one ─────────────────────
//
// Fourth and last instance of the family opened in ux-682: a key named after its READER is invisible
// to its collection's invalidation. The first three were found by chasing a specific surface. This one
// was found by asking the general question — *which collections are read under keys in more than one
// namespace?* — over all 74 collection reads in the tree. Ten came back; two were real:
//
//   api.tasks()        `tasks` (list)              + `tasks-all` (create form, **persist: true**)
//   api.modelsLoaded() `settings:models-loaded`     + `dashboard:on-this-machine`
//
// 🔴 TASKS. All three busts read `invalidateCache('tasks')` — exact-key mode, so `tasks-all` was never
// dropped by anything, ever. That key feeds `DependencyEditor`, the *only* place a task's dependencies
// are chosen, and it is `persist: true`.
//
// 🪤 AND HERE IS WHERE THIS CYCLE ALMOST SHIPPED A FALSE CLAIM. The obvious write-up is "creating a
// task and then depending on it was impossible". Driven in the browser against the PRE-FIX build, the
// just-created task **was** offered — because `useCachedData` revalidates on EVERY mount, so a missing
// bust cannot produce a durably wrong list. It produces a wrong FIRST PAINT, for the length of one
// refetch, and `persist: true` means a hard reload — the gesture a user makes when a list looks wrong —
// paints that same wrong list again before correcting itself. That is the real, smaller defect. It is
// worth fixing and it is not worth overstating. (The two sibling cycles that opened this family, #1682
// and #1686, describe their staleness as surviving a reload; by this measurement the survival is one
// revalidation window, not indefinite.)
//
// 🔴 MODELS. Two surfaces made the byte-identical `api.modelsLoaded()` read under two surface-named
// keys, and BOTH offer Unload. Each only called `refresh()` — its own key — so each left the other's
// cached copy describing freed memory as still resident, to be painted on its next mount until that
// mount's refetch landed. `OnThisMachine`'s own doc claims the two surfaces "cannot drift into
// disagreeing about which model is reclaimable"; shared derivations keep the rendering honest, but
// nothing kept the cached data honest. Fixed by sharing ONE key rather than making two keys mutually
// reachable: the reads are identical, so two keys bought nothing but the drift and a duplicate fetch.
//
// 🪤 A BUST IS ONLY LOAD-BEARING WHILE A READER IS MOUNTED. Neither pair is ever co-mounted (list vs
// `#/tasks/new`; dashboard vs `#/settings/models`), and the hook has no cross-instance subscribers —
// so no amount of invalidation propagates to a live sibling. Anyone extending this family should check
// co-mounting first: that is where a missing bust becomes durable rather than transient.
//
// 🪤 THE GENERAL CHECK IS NOT "TWO KEYS" — IT IS "TWO KEYS OVER THE SAME CONTENT". `api.uLoops()` is
// also read under two namespaces (`loops` and `code:projects`) and is NOT a defect: the two keys hold
// disjoint filtered subsets (`kind !== 'code'` vs code-only), so a mutation in one cannot staleten the
// other. Converging those would have destroyed a real distinction. Asserted below so no later pass
// "fixes" it.
