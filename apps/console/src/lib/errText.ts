/** Turn a failed `Response` into the sentence a user should read.
 *
 *  Every API failure message in the app funnels through here — `api.ts`'s helpers, its
 *  hand-rolled fetches (streams, file reads) and the chunked uploader — so this is the one
 *  place that decides what a user is told when something fails. Since the failure line now
 *  carries `role="alert"` (`ui/forms.tsx`'s `FieldError`), whatever this returns is also read
 *  ALOUD, which raises the bar on what may pass through.
 *
 *  Measured against the three body shapes a real deployment produces, driving a save failure on
 *  `#/settings/design`:
 *
 *    {"error": "name is required"}   → "name is required"          ✅ the gateway's own shape
 *    an nginx 502 HTML page          → 158 chars of raw markup     ❌ announced verbatim
 *    an empty body                   → "HTTP 502"                  ✅ terse but honest
 *
 *  The middle row is the defect this closes: Gideon is reachable through tunnels and
 *  reverse proxies, and a front door that is up while the gateway is down answers with an HTML
 *  error page. That page is not a message for a user, and it certainly is not one to speak.
 *
 *  So: the backend's own text when there is one, otherwise a short plain-text body verbatim
 *  (some endpoints answer in text and it is useful), and otherwise the status — never markup,
 *  never a wall.
