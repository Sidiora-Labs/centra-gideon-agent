/** Turn a failed `Response` into the sentence a user should read.
 *
 *  Every API failure message in the app funnels through here — `api.ts`'s helpers, its
 *  hand-rolled fetches (streams, file reads) and the chunked uploader — so this is the one
 *  place that decides what a user is told when something fails. Since the failure line now
 *  carries `role="alert"` (`ui/forms.tsx`'s `FieldError`), whatever this returns is also read
 *  ALOUD, which raises the bar on what may pass through.
 *
 *  Measured against the three body shapes a real deployment produces, driving a save failure on
 *  `#/settings/design`:
 *
 *    {"error": "name is required"}   → "name is required"          ✅ the gateway's own shape
 *    an nginx 502 HTML page          → 158 chars of raw markup     ❌ announced verbatim
 *    an empty body                   → "HTTP 502"                  ✅ terse but honest
 *
 *  The middle row is the defect this closes: Gideon is reachable through tunnels and
 *  reverse proxies, and a front door that is up while the gateway is down answers with an HTML
 *  error page. That page is not a message for a user, and it certainly is not one to speak.
 *
 *  So: the backend's own text when there is one, otherwise a short plain-text body verbatim
 *  (some endpoints answer in text and it is useful) — but never on a 5xx, where a plain-text body
 *  is the framework's crash page rather than anyone's message — and otherwise the status. Never
 *  markup, never a wall, never a stack the server printed to itself.
 *
 *  🔑 THE ENVELOPE CARRIES TWO THINGS AND THIS USED TO KEEP ONE. `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`
 *  is parsed here already; only the sentence survived, and the `code` — the half that exists
 *  precisely so a client can BRANCH — was discarded at the funnel. Four learning panels then
 *  matched their code against the human sentence (`message.includes('evals_disabled')`), which
 *  the message never contains, so six deliberate branches shipped unreachable. `errEnvelope`
 *  returns both; `errText` is it minus the code, byte for byte, so nothing a user reads moves.

   *  that is too structured to be a sentence. A workflow start refused by preflight answers
   *  `detail.preflight.findings[]`, and `preflight.Finding` states why the field exists:
   *  "the message says what is wrong, the remediation says what to do, and collapsing them
   *  leaves the user with a diagnosis and no next step". Dropped here, that remediation
   *  reached no surface at all — the user was told no model resolves for three use cases and
   *  never told that Settings → Models is where to fix it, though the server said exactly that.
   *
   *  Deliberately `unknown`: this funnel must not learn any route's detail schema. A caller
   *  that knows its own route narrows it (see `preflightRemediations`); everyone else ignores
   *  it, and nothing a user reads moves. */

 *  when attempting to fetch resource.". None of those passes through `errEnvelope`, so a surface
 *  printing `error.message` prints them verbatim.
 *
 *  The other entry is `HTTP <status>`, which is `errEnvelope`'s own deliberate output for a body it
 *  refused to show. Terse-but-honest is right in a one-line `FieldError` under an input. It is
 *  wrong as the explanation beneath a headline that already read "Couldn't load your projects",
 *  where it displaces a written sentence and offers a number the reader cannot use.
