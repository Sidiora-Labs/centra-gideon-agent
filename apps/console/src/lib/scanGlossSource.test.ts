// ── The gloss map is DATA, shared with the Python CLI ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The sentences used to be a literal in `scanFindings.ts`. Then `gideon skills install`
// needed the same map from Python (#2633) and could not have it: the wheel ships `web/dist`, not
// `web/src`. Duplicating the map in Python is the two-copies-of-one-fact defect #2535 removed, so
// the map moved to `src/gideon/scan_rule_gloss.json` — packaged for the wheel, imported here
// at build time. `tests/test_scan_rule_gloss.py` proves the Python half, including reading the
// file back out of a built wheel.
//
// 🪤 THIS SIDE FAILS DIFFERENTLY, AND WORSE. Python's loader RAISES on an empty map. A Vite build
// with an emptied JSON succeeds: `SCAN_RULE_GLOSS` becomes `{}`, `ruleGloss` answers `''` for
// everything, and every gloss silently vanishes from both consent surfaces — the exact silence the
// map exists to remove, arriving as a green build. So the floor is asserted here, not assumed.
