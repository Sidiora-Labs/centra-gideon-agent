/** The renderer's typed view of the desktop shell bridge (DC-2 C1).

 *  `window.pclawDesktop` exists ONLY inside the Electron shell — `preload.js` exposes
 *  it over `contextBridge` with `contextIsolation: true`. In a browser tab it is
 *  undefined, and every helper here returns a value that says so rather than throwing
 *  or pretending. One module owns the `declare global`, so no surface hand-rolls an
 *  `as any` cast to reach the shell.
 *
 *  There is deliberately no token accessor: the gateway `shell_token` lives in the
 *  Electron MAIN process, so page JS has no path to it even if a page is compromised.
