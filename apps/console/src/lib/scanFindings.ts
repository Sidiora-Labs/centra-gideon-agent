/** The shared rules for listing security-scan findings on a consent surface.
 *
 *  🔑 BOTH CONSENT SURFACES TRUNCATE THE SAME LIST, and each had hardcoded its own `8`. An app
 *  install (`apps/installConsent`) and a skill install (`skills/MarketplaceDetail`) render findings
 *  from the same `scan.findings` shape for the same decision — "do I trust this?" — so the cap and
 *  the sentence that discloses it belong in one place. Two independently-chosen limits are two
 *  numbers that drift, and a user comparing the two surfaces has no way to know either is a limit.
 *
 *  🪤 THE CAP IS NOT THE BUG; THE SILENCE IS. `installConsent`'s own comment says the surface exists
 *  so "the scanner findings and the 'Install anyway' action are reachable without re-typing the
 *  source", and that a warning verdict "must show the same scanner findings" wherever the install
 *  started. A list that stops at 8 with nothing said contradicts that: the user reads eight findings
 *  as ALL the findings and consents to an app with fourteen. */

/** What each scanner rule MEANS, in terms of what the app can then do to this machine.
 *
 *  🔑 A RULE NAME IS NOT A DISCLOSURE. The findings list rendered `python_exec (warning) —
 *  server/provider.py: subprocess.run([...])`, which names the pattern and shows the code but
 *  never says what the pattern lets the app do. A non-expert cannot weigh "python_exec" at all,
 *  and the whole point of the surface is a yes/no a non-expert can give. The gloss COMPLEMENTS
 *  the evidence — the evidence is the concrete argv, this is the consequence — so it stays one
 *  clause and never restates the snippet.
 *
 *  🪤 It is disclosure only. Glossing a rule does not soften it: the severity beside it and the
 *  verdict above it are untouched, and a `dangerous` finding reads as terminal either way. The
 *  vocabulary is closed (`supply_chain.py`'s pattern catalog), and a Python rail asserts this map
 *  covers every rule the scanner can emit — a new rule ships glossed or reds the suite, because
 *  the failure mode here is silence, and silence is what the user reads as "probably fine".
 *
 *  🪤 THE SENTENCES ARE NOT DEFINED HERE ANY MORE (#2633). `gideon skills install` refuses
 *  from Python and rendered the same findings BARE, so the third renderer needed the same map and
 *  could not import TypeScript — the wheel ships `web/dist`, not `web/src`. The map moved to
 *  `src/gideon/scan_rule_gloss.json`, which is packaged (pyproject `package-data`) and
 *  imported here. One literal, two languages: duplicating it in Python would have re-created the
 *  two-copies-of-one-fact defect this file's own header condemns. */
