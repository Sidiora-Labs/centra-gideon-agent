/** THE one place that turns "where did these bytes come from" into words a user reads.
 *
 *  Provenance is one fact with several representations, and the surfaces used to disagree
 *  about it:
 *    • the Store card never showed it as TEXT at all before install (#2528) — only the
 *      source divider heading (a folder basename) and the Sources rail hinted at it, so a
 *      card whose bytes came from a remote could be read as the local copy you just added;
 *    • Settings → Tools badged every non-locked native provider `built-in` (#2514), which
 *      reads as provenance while not being provenance — two bundles added from a
 *      user-created local Store source carried the identical badge as `gideon-artifacts`.
 *
 *  The FACT is owned by the backend (`apps/catalog.py`: `sourceKind`, `SOURCE_PRECEDENCE`,
 *  `source_kind_for_origin`). This module owns its RENDERING, and nothing else derives a
 *  provenance label — `test_one_owner_labels_app_provenance` reds on a second labeller.
