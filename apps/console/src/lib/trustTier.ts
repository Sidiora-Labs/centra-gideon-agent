/** The ONE place a supply-chain trust tier is spelled for a human.
 *
 *  🔑 TWO SURFACES DISAGREEING ABOUT A BUNDLE'S TIER *IS* THE DEFECT (#2627). The install dialog
 *  discloses "Unsigned — community tier" and the user consents to that; the Tools page then badged
 *  the same installed bundle `built-in` — the identical word core's own first-party providers get.
 *  The tier exists to inform consent, and the Tools page is where a user later goes to audit what
 *  is running and where it came from, so an answer that is wrong in the *reassuring* direction
 *  there undoes the disclosure the install flow just made.
 *
 *  🪤 SO THE STRING CANNOT LIVE TWICE. Both surfaces now read this map. Two independent literals
 *  would drift again the moment one surface is reworded — which is exactly how the badge and the
 *  dialog came to say different things about the same bytes. `web/src/lib/scanFindings` is the
 *  precedent: the same reasoning for the findings cap that two consent surfaces had each hardcoded.
 *
 *  The vocabulary is CLOSED and mirrors `supply_chain.TrustTier` — the enum the install gate
 *  computes and `ScanReport.to_dict` puts on the wire. A tier the backend can emit and this map
 *  does not know would render as raw JSON, so a Python-side addition has to land here too. */
