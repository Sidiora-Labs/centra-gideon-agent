// ── Every surface that lists a scan finding says what the rule MEANS (#2535) ─────────────────────
//
// The app-install card and the skills marketplace ask the user the SAME question — "install this
// third-party code, on a scanner verdict, having read a list of findings?" — and #2534 answered it
// on one of them. The other went on rendering `python_exec in scripts/fetch.py`: the scanner's
// vocabulary and a file path, with nothing a non-expert can weigh. `ruleGloss` was already exported
// and already coverage-pinned in Python; the only thing missing was the second import.
//
// 🔑 THIS RAIL IS POPULATION-KEYED, because "a second consumer was missed" is the whole issue. The
// expected set is DERIVED by walking web/src for anything that renders a finding's `rule`, not
// hand-listed — a third consent surface joins the population the moment it lands, and reds until it
// glosses. A hand-list would have passed on the day #2535 was filed.
//
// 🪤 VACUITY, BOTH WAYS. A census that matches zero files is green and worthless, so the population
// carries a floor. But `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2)` on the derived count is not a floor — it is the
// same regex vouching for itself, and if the regex silently stops matching, the count and the
// expectation fail together in the wrong direction. So the lower bound is asserted a SECOND way that
// shares no parse with the derivation: the two known consumer files are named, read, and each
// checked for `.rule` and `ruleGloss` directly. If the walker breaks, that assertion still holds the
// floor; if the walker works but a file drops its gloss, the census catches it.
//
// 🪤 KEYED ON `.rule` OFF A FINDING, not on the word "findings". `chat/SdlcProgressCard`,
// `code/CodeCockpitPage`, `loops/*` and `workflows/ReviewTriagePanel` all render a `findings` array
// — an SDLC/loop REVIEW finding, a different concept wearing the same noun. Glossing those with a
// supply-chain rule map would be a non-defect "fix".
//
// 🪤 NOT PINNED HERE: `cli.py:1681` (`gideon skills install`) prints the same
// `[severity] rule in path: evidence` row on a refusal and carries NO gloss, because this map is
// TypeScript and the CLI is Python. Duplicating the sentences there is precisely the defect this
// change removes (two answers to one question), and single-sourcing them across the language
// boundary is an architecture call, not a wiring one. It is reported in the PR, deliberately not
// papered over with a second map and deliberately not pinned green.
