// ── Gideon service worker (MOBILE-COMPANION T3.1) ─────────────────────
//
// Thin plumbing. Every caching decision is delegated to `app/swPolicy.ts`, which
// is pure and unit-tested; this file only wires it to the worker lifecycle. Built
// to `dist/sw.js` by `scripts/buildServiceWorker.mjs` (esbuild, invoked from a
// Vite `closeBundle` hook) so it lands at the dist ROOT and therefore registers
// at scope `/` — a worker emitted under `/assets/` could only control `/assets/`.
//
// It is typechecked by `tsconfig.sw.json`, not the app's `tsconfig.json`: the
// `webworker` and `dom` libs cannot coexist in one TypeScript program (they
// redeclare `self`, `location`, `fetch`, …), so the worker gets its own program.
// `npm run typecheck` runs both.
//
// UPDATE / ACTIVATION STRATEGY — deliberately the conservative default:
// NO `skipWaiting()`, NO `clients.claim()`. A new worker waits until every tab
// running the old one is gone, and only then purges the old caches. Three
// reasons, in order of weight:
//
//   1. It buys nothing. Navigations are already network-first, so a reachable
//      gateway always serves the freshest `index.html` — a stale shell cannot
//      pin an old bundle even under the old worker. `skipWaiting` would only
//      make the swap happen sooner, not make it correct.
//   2. It would actively break live tabs. `App.tsx` lazy-loads nearly every
//      route, so an open tab requests hashed chunks on demand. Claiming clients
//      and purging the previous cache in the same activation swaps the asset
//      cache out from under that tab; a chunk the new build no longer ships
//      would then 404 and the route would fail to mount.
//   3. The gateway serves this same SPA to the desktop app at `/`. A wrong
//      update strategy here is not a phone bug, it is every user's bug.
//
// `CACHE_NAME` is versioned by a hash of the built `/assets` filenames, so a
// build whose output changed gets a fresh cache and activation evicts the
// orphans — deterministically, with no timestamp to make builds irreproducible.
