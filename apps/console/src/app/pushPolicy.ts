// ── Push policy (MOBILE-COMPANION MC-5) ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Pure, unit-tested decisions for the service worker's `push` and
// `notificationclick` handlers. `sw.ts` stays thin plumbing, exactly as it does
// for `swPolicy.ts` — for the same reason: the rule that matters here is a
// SECURITY rule, and a security rule buried in an event handler that only a
// real browser can run is a rule nobody can test.
//
// THE RULE: a push payload is `{kind, item_id}` and the notification the user
// sees is composed from `kind` ALONE, out of the fixed table below. Nothing the
// backend sends is ever rendered. That is not belt-and-braces — it is the other
// half of the guarantee. The backend refuses to put content IN a payload; this
// file refuses to render anything OUT of one. Either half alone could be
// defeated by a future edit to the other side.
