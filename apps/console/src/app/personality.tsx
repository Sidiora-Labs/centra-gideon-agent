 *  Colors are deliberately NOT handled here — a personality names a `baseScheme`
 *  and the existing appearance store applies it, so palettes keep their single
 *  code path (and their automatic contrast coverage). What this owns is the
 *  identity chrome that had no home before: the wordmark label, the tab title,
 *  the favicon, and the UI density.
 *
 *  The load-bearing property is **full restore**. Activating a personality must
 *  be completely undoable, so every document-level mutation is captured on first
 *  use and written back when the default identity is selected. Without that,
 *  trying a personality would silently leave a wrong favicon or title behind, and
 *  the switch would feel like damage rather than a preference.
 *
 *  Anything that changes SERVER state (the assistant's name) is not applied here
 *  at all — the picker offers it with a checkbox. See DesignPanel. */
