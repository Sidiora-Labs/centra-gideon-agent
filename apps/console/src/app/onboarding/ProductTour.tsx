/** The replayable product tour (ONBOARDING-UX Session 5 / T5.1).
 *
 *  Mounted in the shell, once, and normally renders nothing. It runs when something asks
 *  for it — the onboarding done screen, or the Discover hub's "Replay the tour" card, both
 *  through `tourLaunch.ts` — and it is what does the walking: `SpotlightTour` draws a stop
 *  and reports Back/Next, this owns which stop that is and which surface it lives on.
 *
 *  **Guidance never gates**, which here means three specific things:
 *   • the tour has no step that blocks and no step that must be finished;
 *   • Escape (or the X, or a click outside the card) exits from any stop, leaving the app
 *     exactly as reachable as it was — the only thing that unmounts is the overlay;
 *   • exiting returns the user to whatever surface they were on when the tour started, so
 *     a tour taken from Discover ends back on Discover rather than stranding them in
 *     Settings.
 *
 *  **Nothing is reported and nothing is stored.** There is no progress field, no "seen the
 *  tour" flag and no request on any step — the stop index is React state and the launch
 *  request is module state (see `tourLaunch.ts`). The tour is replayable instead of
 *  resumable, which is why it needs no memory at all. */
