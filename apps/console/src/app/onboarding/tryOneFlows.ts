/** ONBOARDING-UX S1 T1.3 (OU-3) — the three first-success "try one" flows.
 *
 *  **These are not pre-filled forms.** Each flow is a short chain of the REAL
 *  endpoints the product uses, run to a real visible outcome, and every fact the
 *  card shows is read back out of a real response rather than assumed from the
 *  request. A card that navigated to a seeded form would be a tour; the point of
 *  a first success is that the system already did something for you.
 *
 *  **No paid inference on any of the three.** A first run must not spend a
 *  stranger's tokens to prove the install works, so each flow was chosen for a
 *  path whose outcome is real and observable without a completion call:
 *
 *   · knowledge — `POST /api/knowledge/items` writes the note synchronously and
 *     `GET /api/knowledge/search-for-context` answers from SQLite FTS5 plus graph
 *     traversal, with the embedder wired in only when one is configured
 *     (`handlers/knowledge.py` builds `HybridRetriever(store, embedder=None)`
 *     otherwise). So "ingest, then ask your own note a question" is a complete
 *     round trip offline. The ingest node-graph's model-backed nodes (summary,
 *     entities, AI title) degrade to `skipped` — enrichment is a bonus, never
 *     what the card claims.
 *   · reminder — the `notify` action provider calls `state.notify(...)` and
 *     nothing else, so creating the trigger and firing it once produces a real
 *     dashboard notification with no model in the path.
 *   · loop — `manager.start` writes `status: running` BEFORE any agent work and
 *     only arms a timer; the first model turn fires after `idle_secs`. So the
 *     card's own outcome ("it is running") costs nothing, and the loop is capped
 *     at ONE cycle so the work it goes on to do is bounded.
 *
 *  Flows live here, apart from the card chrome, so the executed behaviour is
 *  testable without rendering the step — and so a reader can check what each card
 *  actually calls in one screen. */
