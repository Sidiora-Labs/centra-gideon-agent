/**
 * MC-9: the relay backend's device half — native push through the Capacitor bridge.
 *
 * This page is served by the GATEWAY, but inside the mobile shell it runs in a WebView
 * whose origin is on `allowNavigation`, so Capacitor injects its bridge here. That is the
 * deliberate split: the shell ships the Capacitor push-notifications plugin (the binary
 * capability), and this served page drives it — registration logic stays updatable with
 * the gateway, without a store release.
 *
 * The bridge is reached through `window.Capacitor` rather than an import on purpose: the
 * plugin's JS module lives in the shell's bundle, not this one, and the bridge object is
 * the shell's own contract for exactly this shape (the same reasoning that keeps
 * `mobile/www/shell/registry.mjs` a parity rail instead of an import — see its header).
 *
 * The registration POST is same-origin (`/api/push/relay-register`), so the device
 * session cookie rides automatically and no CORS surface exists.
