 *  instance and lives on the SERVER (DashboardConfig.user_name via
 *  /api/dashboard/config). That way it follows the user across browsers/machines
 *  and they're never re-onboarded on a new device. Per-device prefs (theme,
 *  width, nav state) stay in localStorage; identity does not.
 *
 *  `onboarded` is DERIVED — a non-empty server name means onboarding is done.
 *  `loaded` gates the first render so we don't flash onboarding before the
 *  server answers. */
