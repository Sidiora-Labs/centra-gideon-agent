/** The SDK's module PROMISE and its module MAP cannot drift apart — the parity rail.
 *
 *  `resolvableAppSpecs()` is the promise: the bare specifiers a contributed
 *  bundle's imports are rewritten against. `installAppSdk()` is the delivery:
 *  the `window.__gideon_modules` map those rewrites resolve from. A spec
 *  listed in the promise with no entry in the map is the WORST failure shape —
 *  `appModuleShimUrl` returns null, the bare specifier survives into the blob
 *  module, and the app's `import()` throws: the page does not degrade, it does
 *  not mount at all.
 *
 *  That was not hypothetical. `lucide-react` sat in the ungated head with no map
 *  entry; growth's vite config documents measuring the break and shipping with
 *  lucide "external and unused" — steering apps to emoji glyphs the host's own
 *  design language forbids. This file pins the parity for EVERY spec (present and
 *  future), and the shape of the lucide vend specifically.
