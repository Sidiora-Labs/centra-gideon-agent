// TWO families, and only two — pick by whether the move carries personality:
//   • `spring` — the raw tiers. Unscaled spatial defaults + `effects`, the
//     critically-damped transition for opacity/color/content (no overshoot ever).
//   • `physics` — the four named PRESETS (snappy/smooth/fluid/playful). Every one
//     is built by `bouncy()`, so every one scales with the user's `--bounciness`
//     slider and collapses to `instant` under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
// Reach for `physics` for anything spatial with character; reach for `spring.effects`
// for a fade. There is deliberately no third set of names — see docs/design/motion.md.
