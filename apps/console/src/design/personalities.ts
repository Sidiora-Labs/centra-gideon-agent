/**
 * PERSONALITIES — a theme that carries behavior, not just colors.
 *
 * Today the app has four disconnected identity knobs: the color scheme, the
 * assistant's name (`agent.bot_name`), the wordmark label, and the favicon. A
 * "personality" ties them into ONE switchable identity, so picking retro-terminal
 * doesn't just recolor the UI — it renames the wordmark, swaps the favicon, and
 * offers to rename the assistant.
 *
 * Three constraints keep this from becoming a theming free-for-all:
 *
 * 1. **Colors ride the EXISTING scheme mechanism, unchanged.** A personality
 *    references a `baseScheme` id from `SCHEMES`; it never carries its own color
 *    values. That means every personality's palette is automatically covered by
 *    `schemeContrast.test.ts` (which iterates SCHEMES), so a personality cannot
 *    smuggle in an inaccessible palette.
 * 2. **The behavior block is a CLOSED, typed set.** No arbitrary CSS, no
 *    injected markup, no per-personality code. Adding a capability means adding a
 *    field here deliberately — which is what lets a future provider seam
 *    (APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION) validate app-contributed entries against an
 *    allowlist instead of opening an arbitrary-code path.
 * 3. **Anything that changes SAVED state is proposed, never applied.**
 *    `displayName` is the clear case: renaming the assistant writes
 *    `agent.bot_name`, real config the user may have set deliberately. So it is
 *    offered with a checkbox at activation and restored by offer on deactivation
 *    — propose-don't-write.
 *
 * The two entries below are deliberately PLACEHOLDER identities: the deliverable
 * of this session is the registry shape and the switching behavior, not a final
 * brand set (the plan says so explicitly). Real personalities can be swapped in
 * without touching any of the machinery.
