/**
 * PERSONALITIES — a theme that carries behavior, not just colors.
 *
 * Today the app has four disconnected identity knobs: the color scheme, the
 * assistant's name (`agent.bot_name`), the wordmark label, and the favicon. A
 * "personality" ties them into ONE switchable identity, so picking retro-terminal
 * doesn't just recolor the UI — it renames the wordmark, swaps the favicon, and
 * offers to rename the assistant.
 *
 * Three constraints keep this from becoming a theming free-for-all:
 *
 * 1. **Colors ride the EXISTING scheme mechanism, unchanged.** A personality
 *    references a `baseScheme` id from `SCHEMES`; it never carries its own color
 *    values. That means every personality's palette is automatically covered by
 *    `schemeContrast.test.ts` (which iterates SCHEMES), so a personality cannot
 *    smuggle in an inaccessible palette.
 * 2. **The behavior block is a CLOSED, typed set.** No arbitrary CSS, no
 *    injected markup, no per-personality code. Adding a capability means adding a
 *    field here deliberately — which is what lets a future provider seam
 *    (APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION) validate app-contributed entries against an
 *    allowlist instead of opening an arbitrary-code path.
 * 3. **Anything that changes SAVED state is proposed, never applied.**
 *    `displayName` is the clear case: renaming the assistant writes
 *    `agent.bot_name`, real config the user may have set deliberately. So it is
 *    offered with a checkbox at activation and restored by offer on deactivation
 *    — propose-don't-write.
 *
 * The two entries below are deliberately PLACEHOLDER identities: the deliverable
 * of this session is the registry shape and the switching behavior, not a final
 * brand set (the plan says so explicitly). Real personalities can be swapped in
 * without touching any of the machinery.

 *  supplies itself. Adding a member is the deliberate act: `SHELL_ELEMENTS` below
 *  is a total `Record`, so a new id without an entry is a compile error, and an id
 *  that is not a member cannot be written into `behavior.shellElement` at all. */

/** The closed shell-element registry: id → LAZY component.
 *
 *  Lazy is load-bearing, not a nicety. The shell mounts this from `App.tsx`, which
 *  is in the entry chunk — a static import would put every personality's chrome in
 *  the initial bundle of every user, including the (overwhelming) majority running
 *  a standard scheme with no shell element at all. `lazy()` puts each one in its own
 *  chunk that is fetched only when its personality is active. `shellElements.test.tsx`
 *  asserts both halves: every value is a React lazy type, and nothing outside this
 *  file statically imports `ui/personality/`.
 *
 *  Every registered component must satisfy the decorative contract — `aria-hidden`,
 *  `pointer-events-none`, and a `data-shell-element` marker naming its own id — which
 *  the same test enforces by RENDERING each entry rather than by reading its source. */

 *  is not a member — the runtime half of "closed". Total and non-throwing to match
 *  `getErrorTreatment`: this resolves during a shell render, where a throw would
 *  blank the app over a piece of decoration.
 *
 *  `Object.hasOwn` rather than `map[id] ?? null`, because a plain index reads the
 *  PROTOTYPE CHAIN: `'constructor'` and `'toString'` are not members, but they are
 *  found, so `??` never fires and the caller is handed `Object` to render as a
 *  component. That is not theoretical — the sibling `getErrorTreatment` had the same
 *  shape and `treatmentPaint` threw on the object it returned (fixed alongside this;
 *  see PT-3's execution log). An own-key test is what makes "closed" hold for every
