// ── A scroll box Chrome puts in the tab order is named by its whole content ───────────────────────
//
// Two capped scroll boxes had no tab stop, no role and no name: the agent detail panel's system
// prompt (`max-h-72 overflow-y-auto`, **1127px of content hidden**) and the inbox proposal's
// provenance excerpt (`max-h-40 overflow-auto`, **1728px hidden**). axe flags both as
// `scrollable-region-focusable` (serious).
//
// 🪤 THE OBVIOUS READING OF THAT RULE IS WRONG IN CHROME, AND I NEARLY SHIPPED IT. "No focusable
// content, so a keyboard user cannot scroll it" is what the rule name suggests — but Chromium 151
// puts scrollers with no focusable children into the tab order by itself (verified on a minimal
// page: `button → scrollable div → button`, while a non-scrolling div is skipped). Both regions were
// already reachable and PageDown already scrolled them. Measured, not assumed — the first probe
// used `el.focus()`, which succeeds on a non-tabbable element and therefore reports success on the
// very defect under test. Tab traversal is the measurement.
//
// 🔑 WHAT IS ACTUALLY BROKEN IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT, AND IT IS WORSE THAN UNREACHABILITY. Focus lands
// on the box, and because a bare `div`/`pre` has no explicit name, Chrome computes one from its
// subtree. Read out of the accessibility tree at the moment focus arrives:
//
//   surface     before                                            after
//   #/agents    role="generic", name = 2,700+ chars of the        role="group", name="System prompt"
//               system prompt, announced as ONE name
//   #/inbox     role="generic", name = the entire provenance      role="group",
//               excerpt INCLUDING its `<untrusted_content        name="Why this was proposed"
//               source=…>` fence markers
//
// This is cycle 141's defect in a new shape: there, 5 artifact tiles were named by 438-695 characters
// of their own body. A `group` with an explicit `aria-label` does not take its name from content,
// which is the whole reason the canonical form is a trio and not just a tab stop.
//
// 🔑 THE FENCE TEXT IS THE SHARPER HALF. On `#/inbox` the computed name is attacker-influenced text —
// the excerpt is deliberately rendered as untrusted, fence markers and all, and it was being
// announced as the name of a UI control. Naming the region ends that.
//
// 🔑 CONVERGENCE, NOT INVENTION. The trio `tabIndex={0}` + `role="group"` + `aria-label` is already
// this repo's canonical form for a text scroll region, at four sites: `ui/content/ContentSurface`
// (×2, the preview panes), `settings/DiagnosticsPanel` ("Log output"), `settings/SecurityPanel`
// (the shell denylist) — and `pages/tasks/scrollRegionKeyboard.test.tsx` already rails the kanban
// columns to it. These two were the outliers. Both names are the surface's own words: the agent box
// sits inside `<Section label="System prompt">`, the excerpt inside a
// `<summary>Why this was proposed</summary>`.
//
// ⚠️ NOT VERIFIED: Firefox and WebKit. Only Chromium is installed here, and installing engines is not
// this cycle's business. The tab stop is what makes the region operable in browsers that do NOT
// auto-focus scrollers; that reasoning is stated, not measured.

// ── 2026-08-19: the same defect in the SHARED markdown blocks, and a derived census ───────────────
//
// The census above was hand-listed, so it held the two regions that cycle fixed and nothing else.
// `#/settings/updates` at 390px then failed `scrollable-region-focusable` — on a surface the capture
// inventory had never held (19 of 31 settings sections were missing from `surfaces.json`; adding them
// is what surfaced this). Measured by TAB TRAVERSAL, not `el.focus()`:
//
//   before   focus lands on <pre role=null>, computed name = 122 chars of the code inside it
//   after    focus lands on <pre role="group" aria-label="bash code">, content untouched
//
// The offender was `ui/Markdown`'s CodeBlock — a SHARED primitive, so this was every fenced code block
// in the app (chat replies, release notes, prompt previews, docs), not one panel. Five sites took the
// trio: Markdown's diff and code blocks, the mermaid fallback (the diagram's source when rendering
// fails), `ApprovalPrompt`'s argument payload — whose own comment says "on the phone this text IS the
// decision" — and `UpdatesPanel`'s command block.
//
// 🔑 NAMES ARE THE SURFACE'S OWN WORDS, as this file's earlier half insists: the code block reuses the
// language its header already displays (`bash code`), the diff block says `Diff`.
