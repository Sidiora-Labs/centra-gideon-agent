// ── Auth seeding for the harness ────────────────────────────────────────────
// The built SPA gates its first render on an authenticated identity/config
// fetch — the gateway needs the owner `pc_token_<port>` cookie. A fresh
// Playwright context has no cookie, so every route renders the ONBOARDING
// screen, which is a false baseline AND a false axe pass. This setup performs
// the gateway's real token handshake once and exports a storageState the
// visual/a11y specs reuse.
//
// PW_TOKEN comes from playwright.config.ts's gateway webServer: its
// `wait.stdout` regex captures the token out of the `GIDEON_READY:` line
// into process.env.PW_TOKEN. Nothing to pass by hand for a normal run. To drive
// an already-running gateway instead:
//
//   PW_TOKEN=<owner token> PW_NO_SERVER=1 PW_BASE_URL=http://localhost:10000 \
//     npx playwright test
//
// Auth stays ON throughout — no GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none. That flag swaps
// csrf_middleware for _dev_user_middleware, so an a11y/CSRF-adjacent finding
// made under it would not describe a real user.
