/**
 * The connect dialog and multi-gateway switcher (COMPANION-APPS T4.1 + T4.4, `CA-8`).
 *
 * The window is a modal `BrowserWindow` loading a STATIC local file. Nothing about a gateway is
 * interpolated into that document: `connectDialog.html` ships with no placeholders, asks the main
 * process for the list over IPC, and builds every row with `textContent`. That is deliberate —
 * labels and URLs in the registry are attacker-influenceable in the tampering case this atom has
 * to survive, and the existing `renameCurrentTab` pattern in `main.js` (a `data:` URL with
 * hand-escaped interpolation) is exactly the shape not to copy for untrusted strings.
 *
 * The dialog's preload (`connectPreload.js`) exposes six invokes and nothing else. It carries no
 * capability surface: the switcher has no business reaching a microphone.
