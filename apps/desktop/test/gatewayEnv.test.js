/**
 * The gateway spawn environment (DC-1 T1.3 / DISTRIBUTION C1).
 *
 * The clause these tests exist for is `GIDEON_INSTALL_KIND`. It was missing for the whole
 * life of the shipped Linux desktop artifact (issue #2673): the gateway inside the AppImage/.deb
 * fell through `detect_install_kind()` to `"pip"`, and the Updates panel offered an in-app apply
 * that runs an installer against a frozen PyInstaller binary. Every assertion below is EXECUTED
 * against the real builder — the omission was invisible precisely because the env was an object
 * literal buried in `startGateway`, where only a regex over `main.js` could see it.
