/**
 * The `main.js` wiring claims that would go stale in silence (`CA-8`).
 *
 * Everything below is a property of `desktop/main.js` as a FILE, because none of it can be observed
 * from a unit test that never launches Electron — and each one is a claim the report makes:
 *
 *   - the capability bridge is attached only under a `shouldAttachBridge` decision;
 *   - `.local_secret` and the shell token are only ever sent by `postGateway`, which asserts
 *     loopback first;
 *   - the paired-gateway URL is never handed to a credential-bearing call;
 *   - the spawn-local readiness path is untouched;
 *   - there is no second retry timer racing the SPA's own reconnect.
 *
 * A source scan is a weak instrument and this file says so rather than pretending otherwise: each
 * test is paired with a floor that proves the pattern it greps for is actually present in the file,
 * so a rename cannot turn a scan into a no-op that passes forever.
