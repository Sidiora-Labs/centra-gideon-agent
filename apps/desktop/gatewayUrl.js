/**
 * Where the desktop shell is allowed to point itself (COMPANION-APPS T4.1, `CA-8`).
 *
 * Connect-mode makes the shell's target a **user-supplied network endpoint**, which is the one
 * genuine trust boundary this atom adds. Everything about that boundary is decided here, in one
 * pure module with no Electron import, so it can be exhaustively tested and so no other file
 * gets to re-decide it.
 *
 * 🔑 THREE TRUST CLASSES, NEVER TWO. `loopback`, `private` and `public` are separate answers and
 * are deliberately not collapsed:
 *
 *   - **loopback** is the gateway the shell spawned itself. It is the only class that gets the
 *     capability bridge (`preload.js`), because registration proves "I am a process running as
 *     this user on this machine" with `~/.gideon/.local_secret` — a claim that is false for
 *     every other class by construction.
 *   - **private** is a LAN/tailnet gateway. Reachable, but the network is shared: plaintext is
 *     readable by anyone on it and nothing authenticates the *host*.
 *   - **public** is a gateway through the owner's own tunnel (REMOTE-USER-AUTH S4). TLS is not
 *     optional there — see `transportPolicy`.
 *
 * 🪤 LOOPBACK PRIVILEGE REQUIRES A LOOPBACK **LITERAL**. A DNS name that resolves to 127.0.0.1
 * classifies as `private` at best, never `loopback`. Otherwise `lh.0x41.pw` (a real name that
 * resolves to 127.0.0.1) or any attacker-controlled record would earn the capability bridge by
 * winning a DNS lookup. This is the DNS-rebinding half of the SSRF guidance: validate the host,
 * then do not let a resolver hand back a class the host string did not claim.
 *
 * 🪤 IP-SHAPED-BUT-NOT-CANONICAL HOSTS ARE REFUSED OUTRIGHT. `2130706433`, `0x7f000001`,
 * `0177.0.0.1`, `127.1` and `::ffff:7f00:1` all reach 127.0.0.1 through some client, and each
 * one classifies as "public" under a naive dotted-quad test. There is no legitimate reason for a
 * user to type one, so `classifyHost` answers `refused` rather than trying to normalize them.
