/**
 * "Open Gideon at login" (DC-4 T4.3).
 *
 * A login item is a PERSISTENT change to the user's machine, so this module is
 * deliberately narrow and boring:
 *
 *  - **Opt-in.** Nothing here runs at boot. `makeLoginItem()` only reads; the sole
 *    write is `set()`, and `set()` is reachable only from an explicit user action
 *    (the tray's "Open at Login" checkbox, or Settings over the bridge).
 *    `test/loginItem.test.js` asserts construction performs ZERO writes.
 *  - **Reversible by the same control.** `set(false)` un-registers, and the user can
 *    also remove it in System Settings → General → Login Items without the app
 *    running. There is no other state to clean up.
 *  - **Idempotent.** `set()` reads the current registration first and returns
 *    `changed: false` without writing when it already matches, so enabling twice
 *    cannot produce two entries.
 *  - **Nothing outside the app's own domain.** We call Electron's
 *    `app.setLoginItemSettings()`, which on macOS registers THIS `.app` bundle with
 *    the per-user Login Items service (LaunchServices / `SMAppService`-backed;
 *    surfaced in System Settings → General → Login Items and recorded in the OS's
 *    own per-user background-task database). We do NOT write a
 *    `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist`, we do not touch `/Library/*`, and nothing
 *    here needs elevated privileges.
 *
 * Electron is injected (`app`) rather than required, so the whole contract is
 * testable against a fake and no test can reach the real login-item registry.
