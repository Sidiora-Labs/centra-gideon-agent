/**
 * The environment the shell hands the gateway it spawns (DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES `DC-1` T1.3,
 * DISTRIBUTION contract C1).
 *
 * 🔑 THE SHELL MUST DECLARE THE INSTALL KIND, because nothing else can work it out.
 * `self_update.detect_install_kind()` resolves `GIDEON_INSTALL_KIND` first, then probes
 * `GIDEON_PROJECT_DIR` for a `.git`, then falls back to `"pip"`. In a PACKAGED app that
 * project dir is `…/resources` inside the bundle, which carries no `.git` — so a shell that does
 * not set the env ships a gateway that classifies itself as a **pip install**. The Updates panel
 * then offers an in-app "Update" button whose apply path runs
 * `<installer> install -U gideon==<tag>` against `sys.executable`, and inside the AppImage
 * / .deb / .dmg `sys.executable` is the FROZEN PyInstaller binary. There is no interpreter there
 * to upgrade: the best case is a failed install with a confusing error, and every case is the
 * wrong answer to "how do I update this?". The gateway is also a child of this process — it does
 * not own its own lifecycle and cannot re-exec itself out from under the shell.
 *
 * So this is set unconditionally, in dev as well as packaged. "Was this gateway spawned by the
 * desktop shell?" is the question the kind answers, and the answer is yes both times: a
 * `git pull` + re-exec triggered from the panel is just as wrong when the shell was started with
 * `npm start` from a checkout, because the shell still holds the process handle and the stdout
 * pipe it reads the READY line from.
 *
 * It also wins over anything INHERITED. A stray `GIDEON_INSTALL_KIND=container` in the
 * user's shell profile must not make a desktop install describe itself as a container, so the
 * explicit keys are spread AFTER the inherited environment.
 *
 * A separate pure module rather than an object literal inside `startGateway`: an inline literal
 * is only assertable by reading `main.js` as text, and this env is a CONTRACT with the Python
 * side (`self_update.INSTALL_KINDS`). `desktop/test/gatewayEnv.test.js` executes it, and
 * `tests/test_desktop_install_kind.py` pins the two sides together.
