/**
 * The ONE bridge the renderer gets (DC-2 C1).
 *
 * `window.pclawDesktop` is the whole surface: the loading screen's startup status
 * feed plus the native capability API. The earlier `window.electronAPI` namespace
 * (which carried `onStatus` alone) is GONE rather than kept alongside — two
 * overlapping bridges would be two places to audit, and the next person to add a
 * capability would have to guess which one it belongs in. `loading.html` moved with
 * it in the same change.
 *
 * `contextIsolation: true` + `nodeIntegration: false` (set in main.js for every
 * window) mean the renderer sees ONLY what is exposed here: no `require`, no
 * `ipcRenderer`, no channel not listed in IPC_CHANNELS. The capability methods
 * validate their argument against the closed vocabulary here as well as in the main
 * process — the renderer check is a courtesy, the main-process check is the boundary.
 *
 * Nothing here exposes the gateway `shell_token`. It is minted by the gateway, held
 * by the main process, and used only for main→gateway calls, so page JS has no path
 * to it even if a page is compromised.
