/**
 * The shell's own storage scope — the ONE place two paired gateways can bleed into each other,
 * and therefore the only place the desktop shell has to namespace anything (COMPANION-APPS T3.3).
 *
 * The companion guide is explicit that the served SPA needs no help here: it is origin-bound, so
 * browser origin isolation already partitions every `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` bucket per
 * gateway for free. What is NOT partitioned is the shell's own persisted state, because one
 * `desktop/main.js` process spans all N gateways. This file is that scope, and it implements the
 * five-member `KeyValueStore` interface `web/src/lib/endpoints.ts` declares so `endpointScope()`
 * and `clearEndpointState()` work over it verbatim.
 *
 * 🔑 ABSENT, EMPTY, UNPARSEABLE AND UNREADABLE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT FACTS. `read()` never folds them
 * into "no endpoints", because the right behaviour differs for each:
 *
 *   - **absent** — a first launch. Spawn-local, say nothing.
 *   - **empty** — a store exists but holds nothing. Spawn-local, and the switcher can honestly say
 *     "no gateways paired yet" rather than implying it forgot some.
 *   - **unparseable** — something wrote garbage over it. Spawn-local, tell the user, and
 *     **do not overwrite the file**: it is the only copy of whatever was there, and a shell that
 *     silently resets it destroys the evidence and the endpoints in the same stroke.
 *   - **unreadable** — a permissions or I/O failure. Distinct from unparseable because the
 *     content may be perfectly fine and the fix is not "re-pair everything".
 *
 * 🔒 PERMISSIONS ARE THE TRUST BOUNDARY, AND THIS SAYS SO HONESTLY. The store lives at
 * `$GIDEON_HOME/desktop/shell-store.json`, mode `0600` inside a `0700` directory, written
 * atomically. `inspect()` reports whether that still holds. It deliberately does NOT add an HMAC:
 * any key the shell could use to verify the file would sit in the same directory under the same
 * ownership, so a same-user attacker — who can also rewrite `main.js` itself — would simply
 * re-sign. What a MAC cannot do, and a permission check can, is catch the case that is actually
 * defensible: a file another *local user* or a non-owner process can write. That is why
 * `connectMode.js` treats a store with loose permissions as carrying **no confirmed endpoints**
 * instead of trusting rows it finds there.
