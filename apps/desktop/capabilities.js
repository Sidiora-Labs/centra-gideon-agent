/**
 * Native capability state machine for the Gideon desktop shell (DC-2 T2.1).
 *
 * Split out of main.js so it is testable without launching Electron: every OS call
 * arrives through the injected `deps` object, so `desktop/test/capabilities.test.js`
 * drives the whole state machine against stubs.
 *
 * The shell's main process is the ONLY place that knows the host's real permission
 * state. Two consumers read it, and neither is trusted with more than it needs:
 *
 *   - the renderer, through the `gideonDesktop` preload bridge (probe/request/on);
 *   - the gateway, which the main process pushes a manifest to, so a browser tab
 *     and any app with a `desktop` permission see the same truth.
 *
 * Honesty rules baked into the specs below:
 *
 *   - `requestable: false` means this process CANNOT raise the OS prompt. macOS has
 *     no API to ask for Screen Recording and no API to read notification
 *     authorization, so those capabilities are disclosure-only: we report what we
 *     can observe and tell the user where to grant it, instead of offering a button
 *     that silently does nothing.
 *   - Capability probing is implemented for macOS only (the shipped shell target).
 *     Elsewhere a capability reports `unavailable` with a reason rather than a
 *     guessed `granted` — a wrong optimistic answer is what makes a mic indicator
 *     lie.
 *   - `request()` prompts ONLY from `not-determined`. From `denied`/`restricted` it
 *     returns the reason and does not re-ask (macOS would not re-prompt anyway), so
 *     a user sees exactly one TCC dialog per capability per grant.
