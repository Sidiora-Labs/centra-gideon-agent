/**
 * Push-to-talk: the global chord that arms microphone capture (DC-3 T3.1).
 *
 * Split out of main.js for the same reason `capabilities.js` was: every OS handle
 * arrives through the injected `deps` object, so `desktop/test/pushToTalk.test.js`
 * drives the whole thing without launching Electron.
 *
 * ## The shell never opens the microphone
 *
 * This module registers a chord and forwards the press. It opens no capture device,
 * holds no stream, and buffers no audio — the renderer owns capture, because
 * the renderer is where the composer that receives the transcript lives, and because
 * one owner of a live microphone is auditable where two are not. The main process
 * therefore knows whether the mic is live only because the renderer TELLS it
 * (`setCapturing`), and the tray indicator reflects that report rather than a guess
 * about what the renderer probably did with the press we sent it.
 *
 * That direction of trust matters for the indicator's honesty: if the renderer
 * crashes mid-capture the mic dies with it, and `clearCapturing()` (called when the
 * window goes away) takes the indicator down with it. An indicator driven from "we
 * sent a press" instead would keep glowing over a dead stream, or worse, go dark over
 * a live one.
 *
 * ## Why the global chord TOGGLES rather than reading key-release
 *
 * Electron's `globalShortcut` delivers one callback per press and exposes no
 * key-release event at all — a true "while physically held" global gesture would need
 * a native key-event tap (an accessibility-permission-class API we deliberately do not
 * request). So the global chord is a TOGGLE: press to start, press again to stop. The
 * atom's clause is "captures only while held/toggled", and this is the toggled half,
 * honestly labelled everywhere the user reads about it.
 *
 * A toggle has a failure mode a hold does not: press it, walk away, and the microphone
 * stays live. `MAX_CAPTURE_MS` is the answer — the shell asks the renderer to stop a
 * capture that has run past the ceiling, so the worst case for a forgotten toggle is
 * bounded rather than "until you notice".
