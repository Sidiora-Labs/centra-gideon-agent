/**
 * Connect-to-a-gateway-you-did-not-spawn (COMPANION-APPS S4 / T4.1 + T4.4, `CA-8`).
 *
 * Before this module the shell had exactly one connection model: spawn a private gateway on
 * loopback and load it. That model is **unchanged and still the default** — every decision here is
 * additive, and `describeStartup` falls back to it for any reason it cannot fully justify doing
 * something else.
 *
 * No Electron import: everything is injected. That is not tidiness, it is the only way the trust
 * decisions below can be tested against real sockets and real files rather than asserted in prose.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THE SHELL HANDS A GATEWAY IT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED IS REAL — AND THE ANSWER IS "NOTHING"
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **The reachability probe carries no credential.** `probeEndpoint` GETs `/api/healthz` — the
 *    one route in `token_auth._BYPASS_EXACT` that is auth-exempt *and* returns no secret
 *    (`handlers_system.py:api_healthz` answers `{status, version}`) — with no cookie, no
 *    `Authorization`, no `X-Local-Secret`, and it does not follow redirects. A hostile LAN host
 *    that answers it learns that something asked, and nothing else.
 * 2. **The pairing code is never held by this process.** `pair/complete` replies with an httponly
 *    `Set-Cookie`, so the session has to land in the WebView's own jar; a shell that redeemed the
 *    code natively would hold a session the page could not use. So the shell hands the WebView
 *    `<origin>/pair?code=…` and lets the served page do the exchange — the same ruling
 *    `mobile/www/shell/network.mjs:pairingTargetFromScan` already records.
 * 3. **`.local_secret` and the shell token never leave loopback.** They authenticate the
 *    capability bridge, whose whole claim is "I am a process on THIS machine". `main.js` binds
 *    every call that carries them to the spawned gateway's URL, and `assertLoopbackTarget` below
 *    is the assertion that makes that a rail rather than a convention.
 * 4. **The capability bridge is not attached to a non-loopback origin at all** — see
 *    `shouldAttachBridge`. A tampered registry row therefore cannot get attacker-served JS a
 *    microphone, a notification or a global hotkey; the worst it can reach is an ordinary web page
 *    in a window.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * RECONNECT IS NOT A CREDENTIAL RETRY LOOP, BY CONSTRUCTION
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `isRetryable`/`nextReconnectStep` split failures into RETRYABLE (the host is not answering) and
 * TERMINAL (the host answered and refused). An auth refusal — the shape a revoked device session produces — is
 * terminal with **zero** retries: the row is marked `needs_pairing` and the automated path stops
 * until the user acts. Retryable failures back off on the SPA's own published curve
 * (`250 * 2 ** attempt`, ceiling 6 — `web/src/lib/useChatSocket.ts:45-46`) and are **bounded**;
 * after `MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` the policy says `give_up` and waits for a human. Nothing here
 * ever re-presents a credential, because the probe never presents one in the first place.
