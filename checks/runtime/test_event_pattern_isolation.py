"""Rule (d): payload is DATA, never a pattern — plus the ReDoS surface that audit exposed (S128).

§7/R4 rule (d): *"payload content never participates in event-pattern/template matching — only
trigger spec patterns match; payload is data."*

**The rule HOLDS, and this file is the guard rather than a fix.** Verified rather than assumed: the
regex in `matches` comes from `trigger.content_re`, the glob from `trigger.key_glob`, and the
payload
is only ever matched AGAINST. `render_template` does not re-expand a substituted value either
(checked in S126), so a payload carrying `$OTHER_KEY` cannot reach a second key's contents. Saying
"it already holds" plainly matters — inventing a fix here would be worse than finding none.

🔴 WHAT THE AUDIT DID FIND: a real ReDoS surface on the memory-write path. Measured on `matches`
itself, with an author regex of `(a+)+$` — a shape people write by accident, not an attack:

    value len 22: 0.165s
    value len 24: 0.649s
    value len 26: 2.539s
    value len 28: 10.122s
    value len 30: 40.7s

`matches` runs on every memory write (`vector_memory` → `emit_event` →
`on_event`), and
the value was not length-bounded. **A length cap does NOT fix exponential backtracking** — that is
recorded on `CONTENT_MATCH_SCAN_LIMIT` rather than pretended otherwise — so catastrophic
patterns are
caught where they are AUTHORED.
