"""DAS-9: `SURFACE_BACKGROUND` must have a real PRODUCER, not just a declaration.

`durability/state_history.py` declares three writing surfaces and the time-travel panel's "what
changed while I slept" filter reads them. Measured before this change: the ONLY
`writing_surface(...)` call in the tree was `state_history.py`'s own hourly maintenance job, which
sets `SURFACE_SCHEDULED` — so `SURFACE_BACKGROUND` was a declared constant with ZERO writers, and
every
commit caused by an unattended trigger dispatch landed on the DEFAULT `interactive` surface. The
filter could not tell an automation's edit from something the user typed.

These tests assert the CALL SITE, not the mechanism. That `writing_surface` labels a commit is
already covered by `test_durability_state_history.py`; what was missing is anything CALLING it for
the background surface. So the census below is scoped to actual calls (AST, not text), carries a
vacuity floor so a census that matches nothing fails loudly, and the behavioural tests drive both
directions — the unattended dispatch AND its attended counterpart — because a positive-only test
passes for free in a world where everything is labelled `background`.
