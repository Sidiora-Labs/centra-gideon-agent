"""Config validation runs on a NORMAL install, and the dependency that powers it is declared.

`jsonschema` was not in `[project] dependencies`. It arrived only transitively through the
OPTIONAL `[mcp]` extra, and `_validate_config_data` opened with `if not _HAS_JSONSCHEMA: return
data`. So `pip install gideon` got:

* no enum validation — measured: ``agent.approval_mode = "NOT_A_MODE"`` entered the running config
* no type validation
* no unknown-top-level-key warning
* no pruning of retired fields, so a pre-removal `config.json` never self-healed

and CI could not see any of it, because `[dev]` pulls `[mcp]` and the validation tests carried a
`skipif` — a skip that reads as a pass in every summary.

These tests hold the FIX in place from both ends: the declaration (so a future dependency bump
cannot quietly make it transitive again) and the behaviour (so the pass cannot become a no-op
again by some other route).
