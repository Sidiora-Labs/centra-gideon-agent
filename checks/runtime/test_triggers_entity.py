"""The Trigger entity, its specs, and the fire records (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §1 — S62).

Session 62 is the ENTITY layer only: the record, the per-kind specs, the typed fire outcomes. No
scheduler, no dispatch, no migration — those are 63/64/66. The shape has to be settled first because
the migration is the step that cannot be redone cheaply.

**The measurement that shaped this session.** `ScheduleJob` has 33 fields and `EventTrigger` 11.
Checked against the new dataclass: **31 of the 44 have no same-named home.** A migration written
against `Trigger` alone would silently drop `skip_dates` (the trigger keeps firing on a holiday),
`strict_schedule` (a missed slot catches up when the author said not to) and `content_re` (an event
trigger fires on everything). So `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP` lands in THIS session, and the tests
below assert
coverage against the real dataclasses — a field added to `ScheduleJob` next month fails here rather
than vanishing in session 66.

**Two contracts the plan states, made checkable.** Never-throw structural validation (R15): an
agent-authored near-miss becomes a warning with a suggestion, on a row that still loads. And "silent
drops are banned" (R2): every non-clean outcome must carry a one-line reason, asserted by
`fire_issues` rather than trusted.
