"""PCS-7: the per-turn cache fragment states the split, the hit rate and the saving.

Before this change the "Turn complete" line collapsed both cache numbers into one
pre-summed total (``12,400 + 1,200 → "13,600 cached"``) and showed neither the hit
rate nor the money. That total cannot express the only thing the surface exists to
say: a cache READ is the saving, a cache WRITE is what you paid for it, and one
number is the sum of a credit and a debit.

Every honesty rule below is a defect this repo has shipped on a neighbouring chip
(see ``test_context_pct_honesty.py`` for the ``context_pct`` original), so each gets
its own case, asserted on the RENDERED line rather than on a field:

* no cache activity → the line is byte-identical to the pre-PCS-7 one;
* ``cache_hit_pct=None`` prints no percentage at all, while a measured ``0.0``
  prints ``0% hit`` — an empty cache is a real answer;
* ``cache_saved_usd=None`` prints ``saved unpriced``, never ``$0.0000``;
* a NEGATIVE saving prints WITH its sign — that is the ordinary first turn, which
  only writes the cache, and clamping it would turn a real cost into a fake zero.

The last test is a call-site rail, by AST: it is the one that catches someone
re-summing the two counts back into a single keyword later, which is the exact
defect being fixed here.
