"""Write-back routing: an app-served trigger row autonomously fires (TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES — TSE-5).

TSE-4 shipped the read half of the ``trigger`` provider seam and named the gap it stopped at: a
provider's rows rendered but could not ARM, because the arm path PERSISTS and the store it persisted
into was the native one. Arming anyway had two possible outcomes, and this file is written to fail
if either one comes back:

* **duplicate identity** — the reschedule lands in ``triggers.json``, so one id exists in two stores
  and the local copy (which wins every later read) silently forks the shared row; and
* **fire storm** — the reschedule lands nowhere, so the row is due again on the very next tick, and
  every tick after that. "It fired" is not the property; "it fired, its schedule moved, and the next
  tick left it alone" is.

So every firing test below asserts three things, not one: the fire happened, the SERVING store's
``next_fire_at`` advanced, and ``triggers.json`` never gained the id. Plus a second tick at the same
clock that must produce nothing.

The provider store here is a real file-backed one rather than a mock, for the reason
``test_triggers_ownership`` gives: ``author`` and ``next_fire_at`` are persisted fields, and a mock
hides the serialization seam that the whole verification depends on. Its fault switches
(``noop_upsert``, ``raise_on_upsert``, ``noop_delete``, ``blind_get``) exist because a store that
pretends to write is the one shape that costs the owner a fire.
