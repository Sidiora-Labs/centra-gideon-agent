"""`DCU-3`'s stale-index clause: the half a re-snapshot clears, and the harness that measures it.

`DCU-3`'s ``done_when`` ends *"a stale index (past TTL or changed fingerprint) refuses and
**forces a re-snapshot**"*. ``test_computer_use_dispatch.py`` already proves the **refuses**
half from both sides of both bounds. Nothing proved the **forces a re-snapshot** half: the
closest test moves the frozen clock *backwards*, which is not a re-snapshot, and the rest assert
only that the word ``computer_snapshot`` appears in the FIX line. A refusal whose remedy has
never been executed is a remedy nobody has checked — so the first section here runs it, for both
triggers, through :func:`~gideon.computer_use.service.computer_dispatch`.

The sharp part is not that the new id acts. It is that the **old id keeps refusing** while the
new one acts. "Forces a re-snapshot" is a claim about the store not silently healing an index
the operator was told to abandon, and a test that only checked the new id would pass against a
dispatch that had quietly started accepting the old one again.

The second section is about ``scripts/dcu3_stale_index_validate.py``, the live harness. That
script cannot run in CI — it needs a real desktop and the macOS Accessibility (TCC) grant — so
the two things about it that can rot silently are pinned here instead:

* **Its discriminators are the production strings.** ``service._stale`` raises ONE code,
  ``ERR_COMPUTER_USE_STALE_INDEX``, for three different causes (unknown/evicted id, past TTL,
  changed fingerprint). Two of those three are vacuous for a staleness measurement — a typo'd
  snapshot id refuses with the same code as the thing under test. The harness therefore matches
  on the message detail, and :func:`test_the_three_stale_index_details_stay_distinguishable`
  drives all three refusals for real and asserts each names its own detail and neither of the
  others. Reword one of them in ``service`` and this reds, instead of the harness quietly losing
  the ability to say which staleness it measured.
* **Its guards actually guard.** The harness's screens are asserted to REJECT the wrong cause
  and the wrong driver-spawn count, and its preflight is asserted to report ``unproven`` rather
  than skip when the grant is absent. A harness whose failure paths have never fired is a
  harness that reports green for the wrong reasons.
