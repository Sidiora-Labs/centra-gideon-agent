"""Tests for calibration — the instrument that checks the instrument.

A judge that always passes is worse than no judge: no judge is an absence you can see,
while a 100%-pass judge looks like a working control, reads as evidence in the ledger,
and licenses everything downstream to trust output nobody checked. These tests pin the
detector that catches it, and the lint rules that catch the shape before it ever runs.
