"""Tests for verified done, the actor matrix and cascade-fail (TASKS-SOPS §1, S56).

The module's whole subject is that the actor who did the work is not the actor who judges it. So the
tests are mostly refusals, and three of them were measured against real machinery rather than
assumed:

**The tristate is real.** `loop/gates.run_verify_command` returns `None` for a missing binary
AND for a
command the safety screen refuses — verified by running both. Reading `None` as a pass would
make a
broken check indistinguishable from a passing one, and the broken one is silent.

**A criterion-free task must stay completable.** Gating on `Verdict.passed` alone blocked it,
because an
empty verdict is `None` — so every task without a criterion would have become permanently
blocked, and
most tasks have no criterion. Checked against the existing `Task.can_mark_complete` seam, which
says a
task with no exit criteria is freely completable.

**The cascade follows BINDINGS, not the tree.** Driven on a graph with a later sibling reading the
failed node's output — the shape a tree walk misses, and the one where an unblocked task is most
misleading.
