"""The run side's two ledger rails are reachable, and absent is not zero (PP-16 seam 4).

PP-16's plan names the seam this file rails:

    **The ledger rails.** The findings rail and the verdict/ROI rail are PROJECTIONS over the
    `PP-5` ledger, which already carries `step_completed`, `judge_verdict`, `breaker_trip` and
    `watcher_reaped` for both nouns.

Measured on `origin/main` before this change, the run side answered none of it. `service.introspect`
was the ONLY run-side ledger projection endpoint, and against a ledger holding one event of each of
those four kinds it surfaced: `step_completed` as a timeline row that drops the step's own
`output_ref`, and `judge_verdict` / `watcher_reaped` not at all. `breaker_trip` was worse than
unreachable — **the workflow engine has no producer for it**, so any count the run side reported
would have been a claim rather than an observation. That is the trap this project has now hit six
times, and `handlers/apps.py` states the principle: absent and declared false are different facts.

So there are two families of rail here, and both matter:

* **Reachability.** Each of the four kinds is projected, or its absence of a PRODUCER is declared —
  and the declaration is checked against the real emitters, in both drift directions, so an engine
  that grows a breaker cannot leave `RAIL_PRODUCERS` lying.
* **Absent-vs-declared-zero.** Every measured cell reads `None` when its ledger row did not carry
  the key, and a real `0.0` when the row carried a zero. Both directions are asserted, because a
  rail that answered `None` to everything would pass a one-sided test and report a paid run as
  unmeasured.

Vacuity floors throughout: each test writes REAL events with the engine's own `Journal` (a
hand-built dict fixture would let this file drift from the stream it projects), and each census
asserts it found rows before concluding anything about them.

    before it touches disk, so a row written through `Journal` is already safe by the time any
    rail reads it — deleting the rails' read-side `redact` leaves this test green. That makes this
    test a real end-to-end assertion and NOT a test of the read-side redaction; the test below is

    (`_append` redacts, then calls it). So a row can exist on disk that write-time redaction never
