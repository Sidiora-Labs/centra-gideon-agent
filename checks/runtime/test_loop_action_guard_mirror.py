"""ONE loop action-guard vocabulary, backend to frontend (PP-16).

🔴 WHY THIS RAIL EXISTS. Which statuses a loop action may be invoked FROM is one backend table,
``loop.loop:ACTION_SOURCE_STATES``, enforced in ``dashboard/handlers/loop_routes.py`` — a status
outside the action's set gets a 409 (``Cannot resume a loop in 'complete' state``). Every frontend
surface that renders a Start/Pause/Resume/Stop affordance then re-decided the same question by
hand, and the copies disagreed with the backend AND with each other.

Measured on the tree that introduced ``LOOP_ACTION_SOURCE_STATUSES``, ``resume`` had SIX
hand-written guards spanning three vocabularies:

* ``pages/chat/SdlcProgressCard.tsx``, ``pages/loops/LoopsListPage.tsx`` (twice) — three states.
* ``pages/loops/DesignCockpitPage.tsx``, ``pages/loops/LoopCockpitPage.tsx`` — four (plus
  ``failed``).
* ``pages/code/CodeCockpitPage.tsx`` — all five, but written as a chained ``===`` disjunction
  rather than an array literal, which is why an array-literal search found only five of the six.

Two user-visible defects fell out of that. Five of the six omitted ``blocked``, so a blocked loop
was unresumable through the UI everywhere while the backend accepted the transition; and ``failed``
was resumable on the two cockpits but not on the list or the in-chat card, so one loop offered a
different action set depending on which view you opened it from. ``start`` drifted the same way:
the backend accepts two states, one cockpit offered only one of them.

**Equality, not subset.** Each action's frontend set must EQUAL the backend's. A subset assertion
would have passed happily on all six guards — being a subset is exactly the shape the ``blocked``
omission had, and it is what let one missing state ship on every surface at once.

**Both sides are derived.** The backend side is the imported table, never retyped here; the
frontend side is parsed out of the TypeScript. Neither is a hand-written expectation, so this rail
cannot drift into agreeing with itself.

**Every scan carries a vacuity floor**, and ``test_the_parse_floors_fire`` proves the floors by
feeding the parser stubs that must red. A regex that quietly stops matching turns every equality
assertion below into a statement about the regex; that failure mode is the whole reason this file
exists, so it is asserted rather than trusted.

🪤 The parse is a TEXT scan with no comment awareness, and this repo has been bitten by a docstring
satisfying a ratchet, so comments are blanked before anything is matched (``_strip_comments``).
