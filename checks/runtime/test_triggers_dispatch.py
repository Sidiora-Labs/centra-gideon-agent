"""Dispatch and the event-bus delivery contract (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.2/§3.3 — S64).

**The shipped bug this session fixes, reproduced before anything was written.**
`event_triggers._schedule_fire` records the fire, then asks for a running loop and `return`s when
there is none. Driven against a real store in a sync context: `fire_count` becomes 1 and the action
is **dropped with nothing recording that it did not run**. That is the silent drop §1.3 bans, in
shipped code, and the reproduction is pinned below so the spool cannot be removed without a failure.

The rest of this file is the delivery contract, and every rule names the failure it prevents —
peek-then-ack (crash mid-handling loses the event), the consumed-only
cursor (event loss on one side,
a poison pill on the other), the dedup window (a webhook sender's retry doing the work twice), and
the monotonic cursor (enabling one trigger replaying a month of history).
