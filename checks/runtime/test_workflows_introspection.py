"""Tests for the introspection checklist and RunStats projection (§6.4, R5/R6/R9 — S53).

Everything here is a projection over the REAL journal, so the tests write real journal
events with the
real `Journal` class rather than hand-building dicts. That is what caught the two findings
this module
encodes:

**`GATE_REJECTED` is declared and emitted nowhere.** A said-no metric reading it would report zero
rejections for every gate in the library and flag all of them as fake checks — a warning badge on
everything, which is the same as no badge. Pass/reject comes from `GATE_RESOLVED`'s own `approved`
field, which the controller writes on both the auto-approve and human-resolution paths.

**A `step_attempt` on a non-gate created a gate-table row.** `publish` (an action) appeared with
`total: 0` and a 0.0 pass rate — a row that reads as a gate which has never passed anything, in a
table whose credibility is the only reason anyone reads it.

The third property is the badge's sample gate: "0 rejections in 0 runs" and "0 rejections
in 40 runs"
are different claims, and only the second is evidence.
