"""Anti-regrowth rail: nowhere new for the product to phone home.

`SECURITY.md` and the website both state that Gideon sends no telemetry. It is
true — and nothing enforced it. An analytics endpoint, a crash reporter, or a "check for
news" ping could be added in any PR and no test, lint or review checklist would notice: the
privacy claim was documentation, not a control. That is the same defect shape as a config
field nothing reads, except the thing nobody reads here is a promise to the user.

So this is a census of DESTINATIONS. Every routable hostname appearing as a literal in
shipped code — core `runtime/gideon/**/*.py` and the SPA `apps/console/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` — must be
listed in `docs/architecture/NETWORK_EGRESS_HOSTS.txt` with a judgment saying whether it is
fetched and by whose action. A new host reds CI; a listed host that has disappeared reds it
too, so the table stays an exact mirror rather than accumulating.

**What this cannot answer, stated so nobody reads more into a green run.** It is a census of
where, not of what: it cannot tell you what is sent to an approved host, and a new module
reaching an already-listed host does not fail. Static scanning can answer "is there anywhere
new it could go", which is the question a phone-home is; it cannot answer "what left".

Reserved and non-routable names are skipped BY RULE, not listed, because a name that cannot
resolve cannot be a destination — RFC 2606/6761 names, loopback and RFC 1918 addresses, and
`{...}` template placeholders. Skipping by rule rather than by allowlist entry is what keeps
the table short enough to actually read.

Shaped after `test_provider_boundary_residue.py`: patterns + a judgment table + a
stale-entry check + a teeth check.
