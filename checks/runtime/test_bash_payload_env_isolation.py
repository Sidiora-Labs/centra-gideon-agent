"""A trigger payload KEY may not override a protected env var (§7/R4 rule e — S129).

🔴 THE DEFECT. `bash_provider` passes the trigger payload as ENV rather than string-templating it
into the command, and its own docstring says why: *"a payload value like `last_result` can hold
arbitrary text — substituting it into the command line would be a shell injection vector."* That
defence works. But `_payload_env` merges **after** `os.environ`, so a payload KEY shadows the real
variable. Driven end to end before a line was written:

    payload {"PATH": "<dir containing a fake `date`>"},  command "date"
      → stdout: HIJACKED

So a payload value could not become code, but a payload key could change *which code runs* — the
same outcome by a different route. Latent rather than live today (every shipped payload key is a
hardcoded literal, verified for `web_poll`/`chain`/`pull_on_view`), which is exactly when it is
cheapest to close: the next kind that derives a payload key from external data would have made it
live without anyone noticing.

**A denylist here, deliberately unlike S126's payload allowlist.** `$variables` are the trigger's
documented user-facing surface (`$now`, `$job_id`, `$last_result`, plus every key a kind
carries), so
an allowlist would have to enumerate them all and would silently drop a new kind's variables. The
dangerous set — loader hijacks, resolution paths, interpreter entry points, harness roots — is
small,
well-known and stable.
