"""DFE-7 — the spreadsheet round trip: a formula stays a formula.

**Every assertion here re-parses the WRITTEN BYTES.** A test that renders a model and
compares it to itself proves only that the writer is self-consistent; the claim under test
is that the *file* carries the distinction, so each case goes model → bytes →
:func:`parse_xlsx` → model, and several go one step further and read the bytes with
openpyxl directly so the evidence does not depend on our own parser either.

The defect this atom closes: before it, ``SheetModel`` held plain values, so a formula
could only be a string that happened to start with ``=``. openpyxl SNIFFS such a string
into a formula cell — which means the model was wrong in both directions at once. A
formula the caller meant survived by accident, and a *label* like ``"=TBD"`` was silently
turned into a formula that Excel opens as ``#NAME?``. Both directions are pinned below.
