"""URL userinfo is a credential shape every pattern was blind to (#406, #751, #280).

`_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS` is entirely SHAPE- or NAME-based: it recognises provider
key formats (`sk-ant-…`, `ghp_…`) and `name = value` assignments. A credential
carried POSITIONALLY, in the userinfo slot of a URL, matches neither — so
`https://user:s3cr3t@github.com/a/b.git` survived every surface in this tree that
"redacts": the diagnostics log stream, the SEL audit `resources` field, agent
output, and the ConfirmationRequest preview.

Measured on `origin/main` before any change:

    https://user:s3cr3t@github.com/acme/repo.git   -> unchanged     LEAK
    git clone https://alice:hunter2@git.example…   -> unchanged     LEAK
    ssh://deploy:pa55@host:22/repo                 -> unchanged     LEAK
    postgres://admin:dbpass@db.internal:5432/app   -> unchanged     LEAK
    https://oauth2:ghp_AAAA…@github.com/a/b.git    -> redacted     …by ACCIDENT

**That last row is why this class survived a test suite.** It was caught only
because the password happened to be a GitHub token whose SHAPE one of the
patterns knows. The existing
`test_diagnostics_log_redaction::test_redact_log_text_helper` claimed to cover
"git credentials" and planted exactly that shape, so it passed for the wrong
reason — a check on `s3cr3t` in the same position fails on main. That test now
carries both cases.

#751 asked for the diagnostics log stream to call the redactors. It already does;
its stated repro still leaked purely because of the missing pattern here. Fixing
the pattern once closes both.
