"""PHF-7 — the seam that BINDS the offline scripted provider, and its guardrails.

Four properties of ``gideon.llm.registry``'s scripted registration:

1. With the opt-in ABSENT the type is not registered at all — the registry's type
   set is identical to a fresh one, asserted against a NON-EMPTY baseline so
   "unchanged" cannot pass vacuously.
2. With the opt-in PRESENT the type registers once, stays idempotent across
   repeated ``sync_entries_from_config()`` calls (its docstring claims idempotence,
   so it is proven rather than trusted), and ``build()`` returns the provider with
   NO credential.
3. A real, credential-declaring type STILL raises ``CredentialMissing`` under the
   same opt-in. A credential-free provider is a security-adjacent seam; this is the
   rail that stops it becoming an auth hole, and it goes through the production
   credential helper rather than a hand-rolled imitation of it.
4. The declared capability set is exactly the honest minimum, asserted as an
   EQUALITY so a later widening reds instead of sliding in.

``gideon.llm.scripted`` is a sibling deliverable of the same atom and is not
on this branch. These tests inject a stub module into ``sys.modules`` under its
real name: that lets the suite run standalone AND proves the production code really
imports that symbol from that module (a wrong module path would fail here).
