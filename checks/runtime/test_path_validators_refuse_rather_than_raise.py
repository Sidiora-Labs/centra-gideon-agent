"""A path validator ANSWERS; it does not raise (issue 352).

A NUL byte makes every `os.path`/`pathlib` call raise `ValueError: embedded null character`.
`hooks.validate_file_path` had no guard, so `?path=/tmp/a%00b` left an unhandled exception to
become a raw 500 out of every endpoint that funnels through it — `file-read`, `file-write`,
`file-move`, `create-dir`, uploads, prompts.

Measured on all three validators before the fix (executed, not read):

    validate_file_path("/tmp/a\\x00b")  -> RAISED ValueError: lstat: embedded null character
    safe_read_file("/tmp/a\\x00b")      -> RAISED ValueError: lstat: embedded null character
    is_sensitive_path("/tmp/a\\x00b")   -> False        <-- the dangerous one

🪤 **The third result is why the obvious fix is wrong.** `is_sensitive_path` does not raise: it
already catches `(OSError, ValueError)` around `Path.resolve()` and deliberately continues with the
UNRESOLVED string, which then matches no sensitive prefix — so it answered "not sensitive" for a
path it could not read. The tempting fix for the 500 is to catch the exception in
`validate_file_path` and carry on; that would hand this classifier a path it cannot classify and
take `False` for an answer, converting a crash into a possible bypass. So the refusal is placed in
all three, and `is_sensitive_path` fails CLOSED.

Fail-closed is the direction that function already argues for in its own comment about casefolding:
over-blocking "is the safe direction for a credential guard and the error a user can see and
report". A NUL is never part of a legitimate filename — POSIX and Windows both forbid it in a path
component — so there is no legitimate use to break.

ARCC (SAX-04 Outcome 2, input validation and early request filtering) names this exact case in its
Common Pitfalls: *"Not handling edge cases like null bytes, Unicode characters, and encoding
attacks"*, alongside *"Inadequate error handling that reveals system information to attackers"* —
which is what a raw 500 out of a validator is.
