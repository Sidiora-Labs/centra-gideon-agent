"""Tests for the project umbrella, truthful lifecycle and the Work board (WORK-CONTAINERS, S46).

The property this module exists for: **the board must never lie after a crash.** Two ways it can,
both tested here.

* Marking every stale `running` run aborted is the obvious boot sweep and it is wrong. An isolated
  run whose worktree survived the restart has recoverable work, and aborting it destroys that work
  while reporting success.
* A run whose record exists but which never got a concurrency slot is `queued`, not `working`.
Without
  the record-before-slot ordering the two are indistinguishable, and the board reports work in
  flight
  that has not begun.

The third property is that an expired claim is not a claim. A badge naming a holder who no longer
holds it tells the user the work is taken when it is free — worse than no badge.
