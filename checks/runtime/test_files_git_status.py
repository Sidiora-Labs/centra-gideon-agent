"""Tests for the Files git-status endpoint (Files P2).

The ``git_original`` block near the bottom pins #432: one endpoint had re-implemented
``_git``'s subprocess call, and the copy forgot each thing the original knew — a
timed-out ``git show`` was neither killed nor reaped (2 live processes leaked per
timeout), an unexecutable git escaped as HTTP 500 instead of degrading, and a directory
came back as a git TREE LISTING with ``exists:true``. The fix deleted the copy, so the
tests here are about the endpoint's behaviour AND about there being exactly one invoker.
