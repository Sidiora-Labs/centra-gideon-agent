"""Every id in the capability-fence tables must name a REAL action provider.

`triggers/screen.py` splits providers into `READ_ONLY_PROVIDERS` (safe to auto-fire) and
`WRITE_CAPABLE_PROVIDERS` (needs an explicit opt-in). Its own comment says the list is
"spelled out rather than derived as 'everything else' so the security-relevant list is
greppable and reviewable in one place" — which only holds while every entry is a name the
registry actually serves.

`WRITE_CAPABLE_PROVIDERS` carried ``knowledge-maintain``, which is a MODULE name
(``knowledge_maintain_provider.py``), not a provider id. That module registers three
providers — ``knowledge-health``, ``knowledge-gaps``, ``knowledge-consolidate`` — and all
three were already classified correctly elsewhere in the tables. So the entry fenced
nothing: it was a line that looked like a security decision and was not.

It was harmless (`provider_is_read_only` fails CLOSED, so an unlisted name is treated as
write-capable anyway) but actively misleading in a table whose whole value is being
reviewable. A reader auditing "what can write?" saw a provider that does not exist, and
would not have found the three real ones by looking for it.

This test is the reason the entry cannot come back, and it also catches the more dangerous
inverse: a REAL provider that neither table classifies. That one is not merely untidy —
it silently inherits the fail-closed default, so a genuinely read-only provider added
without a line here becomes un-auto-fireable and its triggers stop working for a reason
nobody can grep.

One exemption, added by `EA-8`: an id whose provider ships in a first-party APP BUNDLE is
real but invisible to `list_action_providers()`, because an app is installed separately and
this suite installs none. Read as a phantom, that forces app-delivered providers to stay
UNCLASSIFIED just to keep this module green — which is how `webhook` came to sit in neither
table. So `APP_DELIVERED_PROVIDERS` names them explicitly, and two further tests keep the
exemption from becoming a hole: it may only excuse ids the tables actually carry, and it
expires by itself if core ever starts serving the name.
