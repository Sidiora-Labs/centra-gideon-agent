"""The published-event envelope (WF2-R11) — what makes a live widget foldable.

Every SSE event the engine publishes carries three identity fields, stamped at the ONE
publish seam rather than at each of the twelve call sites — a call site that forgot one
would emit an event the FE cannot dedup or supersede, and that is invisible until a rewind
duplicates a row in someone's widget.

The load-bearing claims:

* **`event_id` is deterministic and unique per run**, so a re-emit after a reconnect is an
  idempotent no-op rather than a second row;
* **`seq` is monotonic**, so a consumer can detect a gap instead of folding backwards;
* **`epoch` is the RUN's epoch** (the max across instances), not any one node's — using a
  node's would let an untouched node's stale value mark a fresh event as superseded;
* a node event additionally carries `node_epoch`, the finer key a per-node supersede needs;
* the sequence is independent of the journal's, or a consumer's gap detection would fire on
  every unpublished journal write.
