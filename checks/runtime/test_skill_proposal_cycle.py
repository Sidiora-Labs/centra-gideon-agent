"""The rail for the skill-proposal cycle (#409 → #323, #302, #336).

**The cycle.** Measured on a live 48-cycle instance: skill proposals were 89% of the open inbox
(32 of 36 rows) and 87% of them could not be accepted at all — accept answered ``409`` permanently.
The links are mutually causal, which is what made it a cycle rather than three bugs: each
*successful* accept blocked its slug forever, hid its own result, and left the row that announced it
un-clearable.

======  ==========================================================================================
#323    ``accept()`` fell through to ``create_auto_skill(slug)``, which refuses an existing slug, so
        a ``kind="new"`` proposal for an installed skill answered 409 FOREVER. The generator files
        ``kind="new"`` by default and its only duplicate guard is ``find_similar(description)`` — a
        check on the DESCRIPTION, not on whether the slug exists — so a differently-worded synthesis
        for an installed skill sailed through and then could never be applied.
#302    ``GET /api/skills`` walked ONE level with ``iterdir()`` while ``ProcedureLibrary._iter`` uses
        ``rglob("SKILL.md")``. ``auto/`` is a directory with no ``SKILL.md`` of its own, so every
        accepted proposal's skill was invisible: loaded into every agent's context, and
        un-inspectable and un-deletable from the UI.
# 336    Both inbox writers here constructed a detached ``InboxStore()``, against ``live_store``'s
# own
        warning that doing so "writes a row the API cannot see … and that the service's next save
        silently overwrites". Three live orphans confirmed it.
======  ==========================================================================================

**#303 is NOT fixed here — it was already fixed on main.** ``accept()`` branches on
``kind == "refine"`` and applies a sidecar overlay. That fix is what makes #323's fix possible: the
overlay path already existed and simply was not reached for a proposal that had not been LABELLED a
refine.

**Both halves, deliberately.** The generator now labels a same-slug proposal as a refine, which
stops
the queue filling. ``accept()`` also INFERS it, which is the only thing that can recover a queue the
bug already filled — no generator fix reaches a proposal already on disk. A fix with only the
generator half would leave those 26 rows stuck forever.
