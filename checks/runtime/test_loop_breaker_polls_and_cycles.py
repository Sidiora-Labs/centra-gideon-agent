"""The structural loop detector stops nagging a waiting agent, and can see a 3-step loop.

Two defects in `record_structural`, both about what it CAN and CANNOT see:

* **A legitimate poll was called a loop.** The no-progress rule fires on three identical
  `(tool, params, result)` triples with no notion of waiting. An agent correctly polling
  `systemctl is-active nginx` while a service starts was told at the third identical answer that
  it was "looping without making progress" — advice to stop doing the right thing.
* **Only period-2 cycles existed.** `span = STRUCT_PINGPONG_CYCLES * 2` hardcoded A↔B, so
  read → edit → test, repeat — the most common real agent loop — was invisible.

The stance stays warn-only, which is a deliberate documented ruling: the failure breaker
hard-blocks error storms; this path only tells a working agent what it looks like from outside.
