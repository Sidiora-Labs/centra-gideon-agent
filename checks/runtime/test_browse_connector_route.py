"""BA-8 — the non-test CALLER of ``browse.target.register_connector``, at the HTTP boundary.

BA-7 built the connector registry and proved its *decisions* with the transport stubbed;
it deliberately shipped ``register_connector`` with no non-test caller. BA-8's core half is
this loopback route, and the clauses that shape the test are BA-8's ``done_when``:

* **loopback only, no new listener** — the route lives on the existing dashboard server
  (a ``web.Application`` here, exactly as ``server.py`` builds it) and refuses a
  non-loopback caller; the announced ``cdp_url`` is refused unless it rides the shipped
  ``LOOPBACK_INTERNAL`` rail.
* **listed as a connected device via the shipped pairing (§C1/C2 — consumed, not forked)**
  — the attaching client is an ordinary paired device, so the ``device_id`` that reaches
  the connector registry is the same one ``GET /api/devices`` lists. An owner session with
  no ``device`` provenance may NOT attach.
* **zero browser-vendor strings in core** — railed on the module source below.

Every leg drives the REAL token-auth middleware over a real ``TestServer`` with a
``DummyCookieJar``, so a request carries a credential only when a leg names it — the same
discipline as ``test_mc2_device_session_consumption``. The connector is a process global,
so the fixture detaches around every test: a leaked attachment would make a "not attached"
vacuity leg pass for the wrong reason.
