"""The source→row item_kind seam (EIAT-6).

The defect this closes: the inbox shipped **live readers** for two kinds nothing could
ever write. ``inboxMeta.ts`` declares Mentions and Email chips, ``InboxPage`` filters on
``item_kind``, ``handlers_inbox`` filters and counts by it, and ``inbox.py`` persists it —
but ``IncomingMessage`` had no kind field at all, so every polled message became the
default ``message``. A mail source could not say "this is an email"; ``ItemKind.EMAIL`` and
``ItemKind.MENTION`` were unreachable by construction (both listed inert in
``inert-surface-baseline.json``).

So the tests here refuse to stop at the dataclass. Each round trip drives the REAL path —
a JSON batch dropped in ``<home>/inbox/incoming/`` → ``FilesystemSourceProvider.poll`` →
``InboxService._poll_once`` → the persisted row re-read from disk → ``GET /api/inbox`` —
and asserts the value the frontend filter actually compares (``it.item_kind`` against a
chip key). A unit test on the dataclass would have passed on the broken code.

The other half is containment: a source states its own kind, so a wrong or malicious value
must not become a row no chip can reach, and must not become one of core's own non-channel
attention kinds either. Refusal is asserted with the warning, because a *silent* fallback
to ``message`` is the very shape being fixed.
