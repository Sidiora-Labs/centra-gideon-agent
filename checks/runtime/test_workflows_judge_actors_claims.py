"""The rail for `judge_actors`' enforcement claim (WF2LOO-15).

`judge_actors` opens by describing two invariants. Until this rail, it said the engine
"ENFORCES" both — and one of them had no production caller at all, because the state
machine has no ACTOR at a node transition to check. A module that claims a guardrail it
does not run is worse than one that admits the gap: an auditor reading it stops looking.

This test pins the claim to the code IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. It fails when:

* the isolation seam loses its live caller (the half that IS enforced), or
* `check_transition` / `resolve_transition` GAIN one and the docstring still says they
  have none — i.e. someone wires the rule and forgets to correct the text.

It deliberately does NOT assert that the transition rule stays unwired. Wiring it is
`WF2LOO-13`'s scope; this rail only requires the prose and the call graph to agree.
