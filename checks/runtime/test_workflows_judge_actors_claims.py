"""The rail for `judge_actors`' enforcement claim (WF2LOO-15 measured it; WF2LOO-13 wired it).

`judge_actors` opens by describing two invariants. It used to say the engine "ENFORCES" both
while one of them had no production caller at all, because nothing carried an ACTOR to a node
transition. A module that claims a guardrail it does not run is worse than one that admits the
gap: an auditor reading it stops looking.

WF2LOO-13 wired the missing half — the judge gate rules on the actor behind its own terminal
transition, and assembles the judge's evidence through `assemble_judge_evidence` /
`blind_provenance` — so this rail now holds the OPPOSITE claim in place: every function here has
a live caller, and the docstring must not carry the unwired disclaimer any more. It stays a rail
rather than becoming a deletion because "authored, never run" is a state this module has been in
once already, and from inside the module it is invisible.
