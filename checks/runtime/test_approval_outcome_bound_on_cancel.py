"""Rail for #1536 — the approval-wait `finally` must not raise UnboundLocalError.

The mirrored-approval block binds ``outcome`` on the success and grace-timeout
paths and via the outer TimeoutError handler — but NOT when the inner
``wait_for(fut, 7200)`` is cancelled (pytest-timeout, gateway shutdown, client
disconnect, navigation away). On that path the ``finally`` referenced an unbound
``outcome`` and raised ``UnboundLocalError``, which:

- REPLACED the cancellation in the traceback, so a CI hang read as an unrelated
  error (the reported symptom), and
- skipped ``_resolve_mirrored_approval``, stranding the mirrored inbox item
  asking for a decision the turn was already tearing down (the production defect).

Binding ``outcome = "rejected"`` before the try fixes both: the mirror resolves
and the cancellation propagates unmasked.
