"""Batch-spawn compilation and its hardening contract (WORK-CONTAINERS §3, S48 + WF2WOR-9).

Four properties carry this module, and every one of them was measured against the engine rather than
assumed.

**Per-leaf error isolation is not free.** A `parallel` with the default `join: all` goes FAILED the
moment one child fails, so one bad leaf would sink a five-way fan-out — the exact opposite of "four
still return". `join: quorum` with `quorum: 1` is what actually delivers it.

**A config key the engine does not read is not a control.** An earlier version emitted `workspace`,
`capability`, `tool_posture` and `timeout_secs` into node config; nothing in the engine read any of
them, and `on_error: "continue"` is not a value it recognizes either. In a module whose
whole subject
is least-privilege, four keys that look like enforcement and enforce nothing is the worst possible
failure — so unenforced declarations travel under a name that says so.

`capability` is the ONE that has since earned its place in node config (WF2WOR-5 C2): it is read by
`engine.leaf_spawn_env`, which writes the leaf's read-only flag into the per-session spawn env, and
`mcp_shared.leaf_tool_denial` refuses a denied tool at the handler on every call. The same rule
decided both directions — the key was withheld while nothing read it, and is emitted now that
something enforces it. `workspace` and `timeout_secs` remain out, and `unenforced()` still says so.

**The leaf contract is refused at compile AND carried into the prompt.** A declared output format
the worker never saw is a gate that fails 100% of the time, so the compile that requires the
declaration is also the thing that delivers it — and `check_output_contract` (the engine's existing
validator, not a second one) is what catches off-format output.

**Mutating leaves serialize through a `needs` chain, driven not assumed.** `frontier` never makes
two of them ready at once, research leaves stay fully parallel, and a FAILED mutator hands the lane
on rather than stranding the chain — because `_visit_parallel` satisfies a `needs` edge on any
TERMINAL
predecessor. If it stalled instead, serialization would have become a second way for one bad leaf to
sink a batch, which is what `join: quorum` exists to prevent.
