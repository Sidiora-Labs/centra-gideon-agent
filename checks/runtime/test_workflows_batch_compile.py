"""Tests for batch-spawn compilation and its hardening contract (WORK-CONTAINERS §3, S48).

Two properties carry this module, and both were measured against the engine rather than assumed.

**Per-leaf error isolation is not free.** A `parallel` with the default `join: all` goes FAILED the
moment one child fails, so one bad leaf would sink a five-way fan-out — the exact opposite of "four
still return". `join: quorum` with `quorum: 1` is what actually delivers it.

**A config key the engine does not read is not a control.** An earlier version emitted `workspace`,
`capability`, `tool_posture` and `timeout_secs` into node config; nothing in the engine reads any of
them, and `on_error: "continue"` is not a value it recognizes either. In a module whose
whole subject
is least-privilege, four keys that look like enforcement and enforce nothing is the worst possible
failure — so unenforced declarations now travel under a name that says so.
