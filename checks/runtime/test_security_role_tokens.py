"""Chat-template role tokens are neutralised in untrusted text (§7/R4 rule b — S125).

🔴 THE DEFECT. §7's fencing-hardening rule (b) is explicit: *"fencing **strips chat-template
special/role tokens** so untrusted text can't forge role boundaries — essential with local model
providers."* Measured against the real `fence_untrusted` before a line was written:

    ChatML         leaked: ['<|im_start|>', '<|im_end|>']
    Llama-3        leaked: ['<|eot_id|>', '<|start_header_id|>']
    Llama-2        leaked: ['[/INST]', '<<SYS>>']
    Mistral        leaked: ['[/INST]', '</s>']
    end-of-text    leaked: ['<|endoftext|>']

Every family passed straight through. The fence defended its OWN marker (a fence-break) and nothing
else, so a webhook body or a watched file could forge a turn boundary in the wire format.

**Why the XML fence cannot cover this.** `<untrusted_content>` is a convention the model is ASKED to
respect. A role token is part of the format the runtime uses to mark who is speaking — it operates
one layer below the fence's argument. Local providers are where it bites hardest: a hosted API
rejects or escapes stray control tokens, while a local runtime applying its own chat template will
honour them.
