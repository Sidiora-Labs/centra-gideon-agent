"""Lesson confidence (WF2LEA-15) — injection is gated on evidence, not on existence.

Every assertion about the gate is driven through the REAL capture path
(``VectorMemoryStore.write_lesson``) and read at the REAL injection seam
(``ambient.frame``). Nothing here writes a confidence value.

That constraint is the point of the test, not a stylistic preference. A test that
set ``confidence = 0.9`` on a row would prove the comparison in
``get_lessons_context`` works while leaving the code that *derives* the number
completely unexercised — the mechanism-not-its-use defect. Since the derivation is
the whole atom, a green suite over a hand-written field would be worth nothing:
the deriving code could be deleted and every assertion below would still pass.
So corroboration is produced the only way production produces it — by observing
the same rule again.
