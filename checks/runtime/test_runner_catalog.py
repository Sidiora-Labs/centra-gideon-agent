"""EI-5: the BYO runner catalog — measured evidence, verbatim probe errors, and the
unattended adapter-verification gate enforced AT THE SPAWN CALL SITE.

Three claims this suite exists to keep honest:

1. **Evidence is measured or absent, never invented.** ``latency_ms`` is populated only
   when a process actually ran and was timed; ``version`` only when the CLI's own output
   carried one. A runner that was never probed reports ``health: null``, not a healthy
   default. Fabricating any of these is the specific failure mode the host's made-up
   ``0%`` context chip demonstrated — a number reads as an answer.
2. **A failed probe carries the probe's OWN text.** The surface prints the resolver's or
   the CLI's exact words, because "not found on PATH (looked for: gemini)" tells you
   which binary to install and "unavailable" does not.
3. **The refusal is enforced, not declared.** The gate is asserted through
   ``ConversationDirectory.get_or_create`` — the thing that actually claims or spawns a runner
   — by proving the provider factory is NEVER CALLED. Its vacuity floor is the same call
   with the flag off (and the same call while interactive), which must proceed.
