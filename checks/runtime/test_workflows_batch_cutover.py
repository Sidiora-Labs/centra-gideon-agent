"""The batch-spawn CUTOVER and the seams that make a compiled batch real (WF2WOR-5 C2).

`batch_compile` was a complete compiler with zero callers: a full compilation layer compiles nothing
until something routes into it, and N independent fire-and-forget spawns are not a batch — they have
no run record, so they cannot be one widget, cannot survive a restart, and cannot be retried per
branch. These tests hold the four seams that close that gap, and each is written against the
property rather than the implementation:

* **The cutover** — N>=2 compiles; N=1 stays a raw spawn.
* **Restart survival** — the widget rebuilds FROM DISK. Asserted by re-reading persisted state with
  fresh objects, never by inspecting the live one: a live object proves the process still remembers,
  which is the thing a restart destroys.
* **The lease** — a second execution is REFUSED. Asserted on the refusal, not on the presence of a
  lease row: a lease that records a claim without preventing the second run is worse than none,
  because it looks like protection.
* **The tool-handler seam** — a denied tool is refused at the handler, with the flag written by the
  spawn path rather than by the test.
