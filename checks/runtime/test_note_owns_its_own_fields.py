"""Caller-supplied `meta` cannot overwrite the fields the platform decided (issue 423).

`ConsoleState.notify` built the note and then merged meta OVER it:

    note = {"kind": kind, "title": title, "body": body, "ts": ...}
    if meta:
        note.update(meta)          # <-- meta wins

`kind` is the worst of the four. `notification_allowed(kind)` is evaluated on the PARAMETER at the
top of the method, so an emitter could pass the gate as one kind and be persisted, broadcast and
rule-matched as another — the severity downgrade the issue names. `acked` is next: `notify` never
writes it (the ack path in `handlers/messaging.py` does), so a note carrying `acked: True` on
arrival is one the user never sees.

This is a trust boundary, not a hypothetical: `notify`'s own docstring calls itself "THE single
delivery choke point for every emitter (crons, loops, hooks, inbox alerts, heartbeats, **app
actions**)", and an app bundle is third-party code. `meta` is the one part of a note a caller
controls.

The fix puts meta in FIRST and assigns the platform's fields after, so authority is structural: a
field `notify` starts setting later is protected by the assignment itself, with no list to remember.
`_RESERVED_NOTE_KEYS` covers only what that cannot reach — the fields written further down under a
condition, plus `acked`.

Measured before the fix: `meta={"kind": "info"}` on a `chat.error` notification produced a persisted
note whose `kind` was `info`.

ARCC's input-validation guidance is the direction taken here — *"Always use an allowlisting approach
over a denylisting approach"* and *"only data fitting specific, approved criteria is processed"*.
