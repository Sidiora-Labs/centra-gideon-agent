"""Guardrail tests for the realtime-transport doctrine (SSE M5).

VISION.md "Realtime transport" — single-transport-per-concern:
- Always-on dashboard state (status/sessions/titles/notifications/refresh) rides
  the ONE multiplexed WebSocket; it is NOT also fanned to a global SSE stream.
- Page-scoped feeds (campaigns/logs/file-watch) use per-resource SSE.
- Nothing is delivered over two transports.

These tests pin the structural invariants so a future change can't silently
re-introduce the dual-emit (the debt M3 removed) or split always-on concerns into
their own streams (the connection-budget anti-pattern).
