"""Tests for project export/import (WORK-CONTAINERS §1.7 R15, S54). The property that matters
most: **no secret value can appear in an archive or its manifest.** Every other test in this
file is about integrity or safety; this one is about the thing that cannot be undone once an
archive is shared. Two findings encoded here: * The safety rules were compared against the
REAL `snapshot._data_filter` rather than assumed to match. They agree on every traversal
case; the one divergence is deliberately stricter and project-scoped. * An earlier version
branched on the exclusion REASON PROSE with a substring test, and "directory is never
exported (size or secrets)" contains "secret" — so every file inside `worktrees/` was
reported to the user as a credential they must re-enter. A prose string is for reading; a
code is for branching.
