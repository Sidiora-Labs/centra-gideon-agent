"""The end-to-end memory sweep (MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT — `MGAV-9`'s last clause).

`MGAV-9`'s six other clauses shipped in Session 5; this one did not, and the reason it
did not is recorded in the plan: three of its legs — **volunteer**, **edit-vault**,
**undo** — "exercise MGAV-3/MGAV-6 machinery this atom only surfaces", so they were
never driven together. Driving them by hand once would not have fixed that. What fixes
it is a test that walks the whole chain in ORDER, feeding each leg the previous leg's
output, so a break anywhere between a write and its undo is a red test rather than a
surprise for whoever next opens the panel.

**The volunteer leg is asserted at its CALL SITE, not at the mechanism.**
`test_memory_push_reflex.py` already covers `MemoryService.push_context` and
`memory_push.resolve_candidates` thoroughly — but nothing covered
`context_engine.push_context_block` on its POSITIVE path, and nothing covered
`DefaultContextEngine.assemble` prepending the block at all. So the reflex could have
been silently unhooked from the turn (`if not kwargs.get("blocks_reads")` inverted, the
`pushed` branch dropped, `_push_settings` reading the wrong field) with the whole memory
suite still green. The two `assemble` tests here close that: they drive the seam a real
chat turn drives, and they read the toggle out of a real `config.json`.

**Degradation is asserted with a positive control beside it.** "Every graph surface came
back empty" is exactly what a test with nothing wired reports, so each degradation test
first proves the SAME calls return data on the healthy store, then flips one thing —
`memory.graph_enabled` in config, or the provider — and shows only the graph surfaces
went quiet while recall, the vault and undo kept working.
