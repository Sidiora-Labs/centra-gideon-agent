"""S2/E15: bundled skills catalog refresh (widgets + artifacts).

Validates the two net-new ports land through the existing Skills entity with no
code change: discovered by the native marketplace, synced by the loader,
trigger-matched by the frontmatter contract. Plus the D2 gate — the `artifacts`
skill may only reference `artifact_*` tools that actually exist in mcp_core, so
the skill can never drift from (or ship ahead of) the live tool set.
