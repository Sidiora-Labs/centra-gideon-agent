"""Every home location the CODE can create is either declared state or a pinned exception.

`durability/inventory.py` calls itself "the single manifest of what Gideon's state IS",
and `snapshot._everything_paths` derives the `everything` component from it — so an
undeclared location is silently absent from `gideon snapshot`. That command is what the
pre-1.0 release notes tell users to run BEFORE upgrading, which makes a gap here a data-loss
gap rather than a coverage nicety.

**Why a census and not a list of examples.** `themes/` was missed (issue 647) and the existing
coverage test is a hard-coded list of nine paths that were fixed once (`TestGapClosure`) — it
could never have caught a tenth. The nine before it were found the same way: by someone
looking. This walks the source instead.

**How it reads the source.** Every `config_dir() / X` in `src/gideon`, where `X` is a
string literal or a module-level constant resolved in the same file. That second form is not a
nicety: `themes` is spelled `config_dir() / _THEMES_DIR_NAME`, so a literal-only scan would
have missed exactly the bug that prompted this.

**What it cannot see, stated rather than implied.** A path built from a runtime value
(`config_dir() / name`) is invisible to any static scan, and `test_the_blind_spot_is_bounded`
records how many of those exist so the number cannot grow unnoticed. The primary defence for
those is `inventory.audit_home()` against a real home.

**The exception list is a BACKLOG, not an approval.** Thirty-two locations are undeclared
today, and roughly twenty of them are real state (`auth`, `inbox`, `sources`, `packs`,
`onboarding`, `session_key`, …). Declaring one demands a per-entry `kind`/`domain`/`merge`
decision, and a wrong `merge` on a live store is worse than an absent one — so they are pinned
here to make the debt visible and to stop a thirty-third arriving unnoticed, not to bless them.
