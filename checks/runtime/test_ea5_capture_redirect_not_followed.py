"""EA-5: the capture proxy refuses an upstream redirect instead of following it.

The module's own security thesis is that ``_forward`` is the SOLE place a socket is
opened and the egress guard runs strictly before it, "so a denied host is never dialed".
``aiohttp``'s ``session.post`` defaults to ``allow_redirects=True``, which broke exactly
that claim: a 3xx from the allow-listed upstream made the client open a SECOND connection
to a ``Location`` the upstream chose and the guard never evaluated — including a private
or link-local one. The pre-flight is a decision about ONE url; following a hop silently
widens it to any url the upstream names.

``net/client.py`` already treats this as the hazard it is: ``allow_redirects=False`` plus
a per-hop re-``evaluate``, whose comment names "the gap an ``allow_redirects=True`` client
leaves open". This module takes the fail-closed half of the same rule, because a streaming
relay that may already have written the caller's first bytes cannot re-enter a fetch loop.

The load-bearing assertion is that the redirect TARGET is never contacted. A test that
only checked the status code could not tell "not followed" from "followed, then ignored",
so the target here is a second real listener that records being hit.
