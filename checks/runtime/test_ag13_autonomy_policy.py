"""AG-13 — the fourteen autonomy knobs consolidated into one declarative policy.

The load-bearing deliverable is the **behaviour-preservation matrix**: a table maps each of
the fourteen knobs to the ONE ``SupervisorPolicy`` field it now lives on
(``supervisor_policy.POLICY_KNOB_MAP``), and the matrix test below asserts, for a matrix of
shipped workflow-run profiles × bundled loop kinds × a template that sets a knob, that the
field each knob maps to carries that knob's CURRENT value — read from the knob's own home, so
the comparison is non-circular. If any composed value differs from today's for any run, that
is a write-scope/autonomy defect, not an improvement: this atom changes *where* autonomy is
declared, never *what* it permits.

The three falsification targets are called out at their tests:

1. ``test_the_behaviour_preservation_matrix`` — remap a knob's field (or the builder that
   fills it) and this reds, naming the knob.
2. ``test_tightest_wins_a_profile_cannot_widen_the_ceiling`` — make a looser policy win in the
   composition and this reds. Widening is the dangerous direction.
3. ``test_a_dotdot_pattern_does_not_widen_the_write_scope`` — ``normpath`` a write-scope
   PATTERN and this reds (``/a/**/../b`` collapses to ``/a/b``, silently widening an allow).
