"""Per-observer coalesced delivery (WF2-R11, batch-5).

The claim under test: batching is a TRANSPORT optimization and nothing more. A consumer that
unwraps a batch must see the same event sequence, in the same order, with the same envelopes
it would have seen unbatched — otherwise the fold law from Slice 8a no longer holds and the
saving is paid for in correctness.

The load-bearing behaviours:

* a one-tick fan-out becomes ONE frame, not N;
* pass-through events (anything a human acts on) are never delayed and never reordered
  behind a pending batch;
* the debounce window is bounded by its FIRST event, so a steady stream cannot starve it;
* a terminal run and a shutdown both flush, so nothing is stranded in a window whose timer
  will never fire.
