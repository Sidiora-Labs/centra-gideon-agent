"""Locate an installed Chromium for BA-2's behavioural proofs — by shape, not by literal.

Two of ``BROWSE-AUTOMATION`` `BA-2`'s ``done_when`` clauses cannot be reached by any assertion
about source text: *"the injected safety script makes a test page's ``fetch()`` /
``media.play()`` / ``navigator.bluetooth`` throw or return blocked"* and *"client-side redirects
are re-evaluated per ``Page.frameNavigated``"*. Both are proven only by
``checks/runtime/test_browse_safety_script.py`` (layer 2) and ``checks/runtime/test_browse_cdp_live.py``, which
launch a real browser over raw CDP. When no browser is found those files ``pytest.skip`` — and a
skip is counted as a pass, not as a gap. **So the reach of this module is the reach of BA-2's
behavioural proof**, and anything it fails to find is a clause that quietly stopped being tested.

Both files used to carry their own copy of the search, spelled as two absolute literals::

    ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1234
        /chrome-headless-shell-mac-arm64/chrome-headless-shell

That produced two silent-skip failure modes, neither of which could ever go red:

* **The revision was baked in.** ``package.json`` allows ``playwright: "^1.62.1"``, so the first
  bump moves the directory off ``-1234``; the literal then matches nothing, ``_chrome_path()``
  returns ``None``, and all 22 behavioural tests skip. A rail that matches nothing looks clean.
* **The OS and CPU were baked in.** Only macOS arm64 was spelled out. CI runs the pytest job on
  Linux, so on the one machine that gates every merge the behavioural layer had never executed
  even once — its green was 22 skips.

The fix is to search by *shape*: the per-OS Playwright roots, a glob over ``chromium*-<any
revision>``, and a glob for the executable's own name inside it (rather than an enumeration of
per-arch directory names, which is the same brittleness one level down).

``checks/runtime/test_browse_behavioural_proof_is_reachable.py`` is the rail over this module. Its
load-bearing case asks the question the literals answered wrongly — *"a Chromium is installed
here; can we see it?"* — using Playwright's own ``INSTALLATION_COMPLETE`` marker as the evidence
that one exists, so the floor is not computed from the value it is meant to pin.

**Absence is still allowed to skip**, because a machine with no browser genuinely cannot run the
proof and failing there would take the whole suite down over an environment. What must not be
allowed is for that skip to be *unnoticed* — so :data:`REQUIRE_ENV` turns it into a failure, which
is how a gate demands the proof actually ran.

``ci.yml``'s ``browse-live`` job is that gate: it installs a Chromium and sets
:data:`REQUIRE_ENV`, so on the merge gate a missing/renamed/unlaunchable browser is a RED rather
than a green full of skips. The strictness lives there and nowhere else — a contributor with no
browser still gets a skip. ``checks/runtime/test_browse_live_legs_run_in_ci.py`` is the rail over that
wiring, because :data:`REQUIRE_ENV` protects nothing if the workflow stops setting it.
