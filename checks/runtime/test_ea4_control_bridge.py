"""EXTERNAL-ACCESS §4 (atom ``EA-4``) — the self-describing loopback control bridge.

What is worth testing here is not "does the happy path work" but the four properties the
surface exists to guarantee, each of which fails silently if it regresses:

* the bridge is **loopback forever** and does not consult ``allow_remote``;
* the discovery file carries a token **ref**, never the token, and is 0600;
* ``requiresConfirmation`` is enforced **server-side** — a flagged action does not mutate
  on first call, no matter what the client sends;
* a confirm token is **single-use** and expires;
* the catalogue is **filtered to the caller's pin** and the digest covers what was
  actually served — a self-describing surface that describes more than the caller may
  invoke is an enumeration of the authority the caller lacks, and the same predicate has
  to gate the catalogue, the invoke and the redemption or the three drift apart.

Nothing here starts a real listener except the one test that must, and that one binds
127.0.0.1 port 0 and tears the runner down in a finally.

    `json_response` through the local ``_json`` wrapper as a variable, and the companion
    rail matched helper NAMES (``_err``/``_error``/``_bad_request``) rather than shape.
