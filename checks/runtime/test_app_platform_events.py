"""Platform event registry (APE-2) — the runtime that honours APE-1's declaration.

APE-1 shipped ``permissions.eventSubscriptions`` and deliberately added no accessor and no
delivery. This suite drives the runtime half through the path an app actually receives an
event by: ``app_events.emit`` fans out, the app drains its broker inbox over the real
``GET /api/apps/message`` route.

What it pins, in order of how much it would cost to get wrong:

* **Deny by default at DISPATCH.** An INSTALLED, ENABLED, running fixture app that declared
  nothing receives nothing — proven from the drain route, not from the manifest parse. A
  filter applied at declaration time and not at dispatch is the "declared, never enforced"
  shape, and it would deliver core facts to every installed app.
* **Exact match, no leakage.** A near-miss (``task.completed.extra``) and a would-be
  wildcard (``task.*``) subscriber both receive nothing when ``task.completed`` fires.
* **The two axes stay apart.** ``eventSubscriptions`` is not ``permissions.events``:
  neither grant implies the other, asserted from both sides (APE-1's
  ``test_event_subscriptions_do_not_widen_the_ws_event_allowlist`` is the manifest-side
  half; these are the dispatch-side half).
* **The three emit sites are real.** Each event is driven from the production function that
  makes the fact true — ``get_or_create_session``, ``ingest_item``, ``update_task`` — not
  by calling ``emit`` and trusting a call site exists.
* **SEL stays clean.** Ordinary fan-out and ordinary non-delivery write nothing; only an
  unregistered emit is audited. The audit assertion has a positive control in this file, so
  the "zero rows" assertion is not vacuous.
