"""WF2LOO-17 — the loop judge's MODEL BINDING is independent of the worker it grades.

`loop/judge.assess_cycle`'s docstring has always claimed a third-party check "stronger
than the worker's model", but every judge call site resolved `resolve_provider_for_use_case
("loops")` — and `loops` is the LOOP WORKER's own axis. The judge was independent in
session and prompt and *correlated in model*: the exact "correlated reviewer mistakes"
failure mode, and the opposite of reserving the strongest model for judgment.

These rails hold the claim true:

* the judge axis is its own config field (`loops.judge_use_case`, default `reasoning`),
* all three judge call sites resolve THAT axis, never the worker's,
* the rails discriminate — they go red when the field is repointed at `loops`, so a
  configuration where both axes happen to resolve alike cannot make them pass vacuously,
* the degraded path is untouched: a judge whose provider cannot start still returns
  None (defer, NEVER a false complete) and still logs WARNING,
* and the config field is wired through all four points — including a REAL PATCH,
  because `test_config_roundtrip.py` cannot see the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` allowlist
  (its allowlist assertions are hardcoded to `evals.*` keys, so deleting this entry
  leaves that file 6/6 green — point 4 needs its own rail or it ships unverified).
