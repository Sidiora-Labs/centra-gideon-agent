"""Regression for #2856 — a chat turn whose provider fails to resolve.

On a fresh install with no model provider bound (`needs_model: true`), building the
native runtime raises ``ProviderResolutionError`` for use case ``chat`` *before*
``run_chat`` reaches its per-turn telemetry block. The user saw the correct streamed
error, but the turn's background task then crashed with

    UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable '_turn_tool_call_count' ...

because the ``finally`` block's done-branch reads ``_turn_tool_call_count`` (via
``maybe_offer_check_work``) on every turn exit, and the counter was only bound deep
inside the ``try``. The crash replaced the streamed error, skipped end-of-turn cleanup
(the done marker, the autonudge re-arm, the "check this work" offer), and logged as an
unretrieved task exception. The fix binds the counter before the ``try``.

The real-home writers (``config_dir()``, SEL) are already redirected to a tmp dir by
the autouse ``_isolate_real_home_writers`` fixture in ``conftest.py``.
