"""Shrink-only STRUCTURAL ratchets over the committed baseline (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS PHF-14).

``checks/catalogs/structure.json`` is a GENERATED census (by
``tooling/scripts/generate_structural_baseline.py``) of three structural properties of production
``runtime/gideon`` — the shape of the tree rather than its behaviour:

  * **per-file size ceiling + a shrink-only band population** — no file may reach 6000 lines
    (one 1000-line step above the measured max of 5447), and the COUNT of files at or above the
    2800-line watch band (9) may only shrink. Growth WITHIN the band, below the ceiling, is
    deliberately not a violation: decay is a new 2,500-line module appearing, not three lines
    added to the file that by construction gets maintained most.
  * **module-boundary / import direction** — a declared layer order (the ledger is a leaf;
    core must not import the HTTP surface; core must not import its own published SDK facade).
    Each file's upward-edge count may only shrink.
  * **duplicate-implementation counter** — the families this codebase has repeatedly
    re-derived: the HTTP error envelope (PL-8 deleted 13 clones; 12 survive), verdict types
    (WF2LOO-16 reconciled four dialects; 24 verdict-shaped types remain outside the canonical
    module), and durable write (DAS-9's mkstemp+rename bypass; 5 sites).

None of those three defects fails a unit test — the code works. Only a census of the tree's
shape sees them, and only a ratchet makes the next one expensive.

This suite is the ratchet that keeps the census honest. It regenerates in-memory and asserts
every counter **may only shrink**:

  * A counter that ROSE — a new giant, a new upward import, a new re-derivation — reds CI,
    naming the file and the specific violation.
  * A DECREASE is welcome (a split, an inversion, a deletion). The ratchets do NOT demand
    equality and do NOT require the numbers to go down — only that they never go up. This is
    why they shipped at the MEASURED population and NOT at zero: a never-run gate given teeth
    at zero reds every pre-existing giant, upward import and clone at once (an outage). That
    is ``PHF-6``'s own ruling, and this atom exists partly to avoid repeating it.
  * And a ratchet that reds ORDINARY MAINTENANCE is an outage too, in slow motion — it teaches
    everyone to regenerate baselines, which kills every rail in the file. Hence
    ``test_an_ordinary_config_field_addition_to_the_largest_file_stays_green``: a real config
    round-trip edit to the repo's biggest module must stay PASS.

⚠️  FORBIDDEN-TO-RAISE RULE (the ``done_when`` doc line — do not weaken it): when a ratchet
    reds because a counter ROSE, the fix is to FIX THE CODE — split the file, invert the
    import, reuse the existing implementation — NEVER to regenerate
    ``checks/catalogs/structure.json`` to bless the higher number. Raising a committed count to make
    CI green re-hides exactly the decay this census exists to surface.

Every ratchet also carries a VACUITY assertion, because a rail that matches nothing looks
clean and is the most common way our gates die. All three are keyed on the census (file count
and package coverage), and the count comes from the ratchet's OWN scan rather than a parallel
re-walk — see ``vacuity_failures`` and the falsification tests at the bottom of this file.

# how to update
    Regenerate the committed baseline ONLY when a counter LEGITIMATELY SHRANK, and do it in
    that SAME commit::

        python tooling/scripts/generate_structural_baseline.py

    Each such commit should be able to point at the split, the inversion, or the deletion.
