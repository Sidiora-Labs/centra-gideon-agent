"""Tests for the grounding bundle, the shape registry, and grounded generation (UP-R1, S41).

The bundle's whole value is being TRUE about this system, so most of these tests compare it
against the live registries rather than against a fixture. A fixture would let the bundle drift
into being confidently wrong — which is the failure mode it exists to prevent, since a stale
reference and a hallucination produce the same rejected spec.

The A/B harness at the bottom is the plan's declared acceptance test (UP-R13.2), scored on
first-try-valid rate. It runs WITHOUT a model: the prompts are compared for whether they contain
the facts a planner needs, and the self-check is run over specs representing what each condition
produces. That measures the mechanism, which is what this session builds — an end-to-end
model-scored A/B belongs with the eval substrate that owns scoring.
