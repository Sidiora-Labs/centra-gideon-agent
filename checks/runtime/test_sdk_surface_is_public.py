"""The published app surface exports public names only, and declares what it exports.

`gideon.sdk.*` is the ONLY import path an app is allowed to use, and every sdk
module's docstring makes the same promise: core can move its internals without breaking
apps. `packages/python-client/channel.py` broke that promise in the most literal way available —

    from gideon.interfaces.dashboard.chat import _run_chat, _save_session_to_history

— two underscore-prefixed core internals on a versioned surface, resolvable at runtime and
imported by three bundled channel apps. A name whose spelling says "private, may change
without notice" cannot also be a contract, so one of the two claims had to give.

`packages/python-client/channel.py` was also the only sdk module with no `__all__`, which is not a
coincidence: with 45 scattered `# noqa: F401` suppressions and no declared surface, there
was nowhere for a reviewer to notice the leak. Both halves are asserted here — no private
re-exports, and every module says what it publishes — because either one alone leaves the
other free to drift.
