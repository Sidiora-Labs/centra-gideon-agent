"""Detector for the real-home rail: nothing under the developer's own
``~/.gideon`` may be created, modified or grown by a test run.

Why this exists as its own module rather than inline in ``conftest.py``: the
detector has to be **drivable against a fake root** so the rail can be proven
non-vacuous (``tests/test_real_home_guard.py`` points it at a throwaway tree and
asserts it fires). A detector that can only ever be exercised by the thing it is
guarding is indistinguishable from one that never fires.

Detection shape — one walk, no "before" map:

``pytest_sessionstart`` records a nanosecond timestamp; ``pytest_sessionfinish``
walks the real home once and reports every entry whose ``st_mtime_ns`` **or**
``st_ctime_ns`` is newer than that timestamp. That catches all four shapes the
rail cares about:

* a file created during the run (its mtime is necessarily newer),
* a file modified or appended to in place (ditto — this is the one a
  directory-mtime check cannot see),
* an entry deleted or renamed (the surviving parent directory's mtime moves),
* a **metadata-preserving** write — ``shutil.copy2``, ``shutil.copystat``, a
  bare ``os.utime`` — which back-dates the new file's mtime to the source's and
  is therefore invisible to an mtime-only check.

Why ctime, and what it costs. That fourth shape is not hypothetical: a config
migration backed the user's ``config.json`` aside with ``shutil.copy2`` before
rewriting it, so CI reported *one* changed entry when *two* things changed —
the ``.bak`` carried the original's mtime and looked older than the session.
``st_ctime_ns`` is the inode-change time; userspace cannot set it, and
``utime()`` itself bumps it, so it is the one field a metadata-preserving copy
cannot forge. The cost of widening to it is **precision, not performance**:
``entry.stat()`` already returns ctime, so there is no extra syscall and the
walk stays single-pass. But ctime also moves for a metadata-only touch —
``chmod``, ``chown``, a hardlink count change, a rename — none of which alter a
byte. Those are reported too, deliberately: the rail's contract is that the
suite leaves the developer's home *alone*, and re-permissioning their config is
not leaving it alone. Reads do not move ctime (only atime), so simply walking or
reading the real home cannot red the rail.

The alternative — snapshot the tree at start, snapshot again at finish, diff —
costs two full walks of a real home that already holds >100k files, i.e. seconds
of tax on *every* ``pytest`` invocation including single-file runs. Startup here
is O(1) and only the finish path pays for a walk.

The detector never opens, reads, writes or creates anything under the root: it
uses ``os.scandir`` + ``lstat`` only, does not follow symlinks out of the tree,
and treats an absent root as "nothing to compare" rather than as a failure (a
fresh CI container has no ``~/.gideon`` at all).
