"""Detector for the real-home rail: nothing under the developer's own
``~/.gideon`` may be created, modified or grown by a test run.

Why this exists as its own module rather than inline in ``conftest.py``: the
detector has to be **drivable against a fake root** so the rail can be proven
non-vacuous (``tests/test_real_home_guard.py`` points it at a throwaway tree and
asserts it fires). A detector that can only ever be exercised by the thing it is
guarding is indistinguishable from one that never fires.

Detection shape — one walk, no "before" map:

``pytest_sessionstart`` records a nanosecond timestamp; ``pytest_sessionfinish``
walks the real home once and reports every entry whose ``st_mtime_ns`` is newer
than that timestamp. That catches all three shapes the rail cares about:

* a file created during the run (its mtime is necessarily newer),
* a file modified or appended to in place (ditto — this is the one a
  directory-mtime check cannot see),
* an entry deleted or renamed (the surviving parent directory's mtime moves).

The alternative — snapshot the tree at start, snapshot again at finish, diff —
costs two full walks of a real home that already holds >100k files, i.e. seconds
of tax on *every* ``pytest`` invocation including single-file runs. Startup here
is O(1) and only the finish path pays for a walk.

The detector never opens, reads, writes or creates anything under the root: it
uses ``os.scandir`` + ``lstat`` only, does not follow symlinks out of the tree,
and treats an absent root as "nothing to compare" rather than as a failure (a
fresh CI container has no ``~/.gideon`` at all).

#: silently ratifies the next leak. Populated set members are compared exactly.
