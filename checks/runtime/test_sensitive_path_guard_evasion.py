"""The credential guards fire on every spelling that reaches the same file.

Two independent evasions of `security.py`'s sensitive-path family, both found by probing
rather than by reading, and both of the batch's defining shape: the control exists, it is
wired at ~70 call sites, and it did not fire.

**1. Case.** `is_sensitive_path("~/.SSH/id_rsa")` returned False while `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
returned True — and the default macOS filesystem, like Windows, is case-INSENSITIVE.
Verified end to end rather than argued: a temp directory created as `.ssh` was read back
through `.SSH` and returned the file's contents. All FOURTEEN entries in
`_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` were bypassed by shifting a key, including `~/.gideon/.env`
(this product's own credential store) and `~/.gideon/governance` (the governance
ceiling, whose whole point is that the agent cannot rewrite it). `Path.resolve()` normalises
`..`, `.`, `//`, `~` and `$HOME` — every one of those is blocked — but it does not normalise
case. `is_system_path` had the same bug in part: `/etc/passwd` was blocked (macOS resolves
`/etc` through a symlink, which normalises case as a side effect) while `/SYSTEM/x` and
`/USR/bin/x` were allowed.

**2. Reader coverage.** `is_sensitive_bash_command` enumerated fifteen read commands.
Measured against eighteen content-returning forms, **15 passed**: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `od`,
`hexdump`, `nl`, `cut`, `sort`, `wc`, `diff`, `tar cf - ~/.gnupg`, `rsync -a ~/.ssh/`, `jq`,
`bat`, and a python one-liner using `read_text()` instead of `open()`. Every one returns the
same bytes `cat` is blocked from. The guard was enumerating the tools someone thought of
rather than the capability. Two spelling families went with it: shell quoting
(`cat ~/'.ssh'/id_rsa`, `cat ~/.s''sh/id_rsa` — both ordinary shell, both allowed) and
built-up paths (`process.env.HOME+'/.ssh/id_rsa'`, which named no `~`, no `$HOME` and no
literal home path).

**What is deliberately NOT claimed.** String CONCATENATION cannot be closed by a regex over
a command string — `'/.s' + 'sh/id_rsa'` never contains the name of the file it opens. That
limit is asserted below as a known gap rather than papered over, because the alternative is
a control that looks complete. The primary defence for that family is the OS sandbox's
bind-mounts over `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg` and friends, which `security.py`'s own comment already
names; this guard is defence in depth.
