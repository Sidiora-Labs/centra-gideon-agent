"""A resolved credential never reaches the run ledger ON DISK (criterion 11 — S138).

Criterion 11: *"`{{secret:KEY}}` never appears resolved in triggers.json, journals, **ledger**, or
`automation_history` output."*

**What already held, verified by driving rather than assumed** — the dispatch half is sound. A
trigger
whose bash command is `echo tok={{secret:MY_KEY}}` keeps the PLACEHOLDER in `triggers.json`, the
provider receives the RESOLVED value (it must, to authenticate), and after the fire the resolved
value
appears in no file under the home. S115 built that correctly.

🔴 THE GAP. The API's `_redact_run` cleans the RESPONSE, and nothing cleaned the WRITE. Measured:
a run
record whose `summary` carried a resolved credential — exactly what a bash action that echoes one
produces — was written in plaintext to **both** `cron-history/<job>.jsonl` and
`cron-history/_index.jsonl`:

    PLAINTEXT on disk in: ['cron-history/_index.jsonl', 'cron-history/clock:a.jsonl']

Both are 0600, but both are on disk, both are carried by `gideon snapshot` (S113), and
both are
readable by anything that reads the home. **Redacting only on read is a read-path control over a
storage-path leak** — and the criterion says "ledger", not "ledger responses".

Fixed at `_append_sync`, the single funnel every run record passes through, so a future caller
cannot
forget it. The per-call-site alternative is exactly how the injection-screen and
capability-fence gaps
happened.
