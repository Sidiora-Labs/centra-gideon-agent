"""Golden-file proof that `frontier()` still decides exactly what it always did (PP-11).

PP-11 moves the frontier's admission step behind an ordered list of `AdmissionPolicy` objects.
"Pure refactor" is a claim a passing suite cannot settle: the suite asserts the properties someone
thought to assert, and the whole risk of rewriting a scheduler is the decision nobody wrote down —
an admission order, a tie between two caps, which refusals get a name. So the bar is the decisions
themselves, captured as bytes.

Two captures, both committed as fixtures BEFORE the extraction and diffed after:

* **`bundled.jsonl`** — the atom's stated bar. Every bundled template, driven through a
  deterministic tick trajectory under four admission scenarios (default caps, saturated lanes,
  starved lanes, run-level WIP=1). This is what a user's library actually schedules.
* **`policies.jsonl`** — a small synthetic matrix, because no bundled template declares
  `max_concurrency`, so the bundled capture alone would leave one of the three policies
  unexercised — and, worse, would leave the CAP TIE unexercised (`max_concurrency: 1` under
  WIP=1, where both container policies bind at the same number and only one of them gets to name
  the refusal).

`frontier()` is pure, so the trajectory driver is the only thing that could inject
nondeterminism: it completes every admitted node, skips every `to_skip` path, and releases
WAITING only when nothing else moved. Nothing is normalized away — there is no clock or id in a
frontier decision to normalize, which is itself the property this module protects.

Regenerating these fixtures is a deliberate act, not a convenience: run this module as a script,
with the tree under test pinned —

    PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src python tests/test_workflows_frontier_golden.py

The `PYTHONPATH` is not optional. A bare `python tests/…py` resolves `gideon` through the
venv's editable install, which points at the main checkout, so from a git worktree it would capture
a DIFFERENT tree's decisions and commit them as this branch's proof. (`pytest` is immune —
`pyproject.toml`'s `pythonpath = ["src", "."]` is resolved relative to rootdir.) There is no
environment variable that rewrites these files, because a golden rewritten by the run under test
blesses whatever that run did.
