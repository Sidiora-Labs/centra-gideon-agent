"""Tests for the concurrent-dispatch benchmark + HC-6's before/after gate.

The atom's gate is that the improvement is REAL on the benchmark rather than assumed, so the
tests that matter are the ones that keep the gate from being talked into `improved`: the
overlap band, an outlier in the baseline's tail, a concurrent arm that never actually
overlapped anything, and the fact that the benchmark reads the SHIPPED log line rather than
its own stopwatch.

Nothing here asserts a wall-clock threshold. The end-to-end case runs a real (tiny) turn and
asserts SHAPE — that rows were captured at all, from real production log lines.
