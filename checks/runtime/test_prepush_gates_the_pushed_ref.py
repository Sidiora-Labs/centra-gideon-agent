"""The pre-push gate must refuse a tree that is not the ref being pushed.

**Measured gap (2026-08-27).** ``scripts/run_prepush.sh`` read the ref ranges
githooks(5) puts on stdin and used ``local_sha`` for exactly one purpose: computing
``range="$remote_sha..$local_sha"`` to decide *whether* the frontend half
(``needs_gate``) and the Python half (``needs_lint``) should run at all. It then ran
black/isort/flake8 and ``npm ci`` → build → ``scripts/render_smoke.mjs`` against
``git rev-parse --show-toplevel`` — the **working tree**.
``git grep -c "rev-parse HEAD" scripts/run_prepush.sh`` returned **0**: nothing
asserted the tree was the thing being pushed.

That is a live hazard, not a theoretical one, because this repo is worked with many
``git worktree``s at once. ``git push origin some-branch`` from a checkout sitting on
``main`` scoped the gate by ``some-branch``'s diff and then validated ``main``'s tree
— green, and proof of nothing about what shipped. Batching (``git push origin br1 br2
br3``) to pay the ~20-minute ``npm ci`` + render-smoke cost once instead of three
times is exactly the shape that produces it: one hook run, three unvalidated
branches, ``main``'s tree gated three times.

**These tests drive the real script**, with synthesized stdin ref lines. Re-deriving
the ref-line parsing in Python would assert nothing about the shipped file — the file
is the gate.

**Why a sandbox repo.** The script resolves everything through
``git rev-parse --show-toplevel``, so the only way to control both ``HEAD`` and the
diff ranges is to point it at a repo built for the purpose:
:func:`sandbox` makes one with two commits and a byte-identical copy of the shipped
script, asserted identical. That is also what makes these legs portable — an earlier
version read *this* repo's history and errored in CI, because ``actions/checkout``
clones shallow (``fetch-depth: 1``) and ``HEAD~1`` does not exist there.

**Cheap by construction, not by mocking.** The guard sits inside the ref loop, before
the range is computed, so every refusing leg exits before either expensive half is
reached. The non-refusing legs feed a ref line whose range is empty, so both halves
are correctly skipped. The sandbox holds no ``web/`` or ``src/gideon`` path
either, so nothing there can pull in ``npm ci``. Nothing is stubbed.

**Vacuity.** :func:`test_the_refusal_is_attributable_to_the_guard` reruns the exact
stdin of the negative leg against a copy of the script whose *own* condition is
neutered to ``if false``, and asserts that copy exits 0. So the negative leg's red is
attributable to the guard rather than to any other non-zero exit the script can
produce, and the substitution is asserted to have applied — a rename of that line
reds this test instead of silently making it vacuous.
