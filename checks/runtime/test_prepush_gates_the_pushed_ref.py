"""``scripts/run_prepush.sh``: it must gate the tree it is pushing, and scope by what
that branch actually adds.

Two concerns, one file, because they are the same two lines of the script reading the
same stdin: the guard decides *whether* this worktree may be gated at all, and the range
right after it decides *which* halves run. Both are cheap to get subtly wrong and
expensive to notice — one goes green while proving nothing, the other burns ten minutes
proving something nobody asked about.

── 1. The tree/ref guard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Measured gap (2026-08-27).** ``scripts/run_prepush.sh`` read the ref ranges
githooks(5) puts on stdin and used ``local_sha`` for exactly one purpose: computing
``range="$remote_sha..$local_sha"`` to decide *whether* the frontend half
(``needs_gate``) and the Python half (``needs_lint``) should run at all. It then ran
black/isort/flake8 and ``npm ci`` → build → ``scripts/render_smoke.mjs`` against
``git rev-parse --show-toplevel`` — the **working tree**.
``git grep -c "rev-parse HEAD" scripts/run_prepush.sh`` returned **0**: nothing
asserted the tree was the thing being pushed.

That is a live hazard, not a theoretical one, because this repo is worked with many
``git worktree``s at once. ``git push origin some-branch`` from a checkout sitting on
``main`` scoped the gate by ``some-branch``'s diff and then validated ``main``'s tree
— green, and proof of nothing about what shipped. Batching (``git push origin br1 br2
br3``) to pay the ~20-minute ``npm ci`` + render-smoke cost once instead of three
times is exactly the shape that produces it: one hook run, three unvalidated
branches, ``main``'s tree gated three times.

**These tests drive the real script**, with synthesized stdin ref lines. Re-deriving
the ref-line parsing in Python would assert nothing about the shipped file — the file
is the gate.

**Why a sandbox repo.** The script resolves everything through
``git rev-parse --show-toplevel``, so the only way to control both ``HEAD`` and the
diff ranges is to point it at a repo built for the purpose:
:func:`sandbox` makes one with two commits and a byte-identical copy of the shipped
script, asserted identical. That is also what makes these legs portable — an earlier
version read *this* repo's history and errored in CI, because ``actions/checkout``
clones shallow (``fetch-depth: 1``) and ``HEAD~1`` does not exist there.

**Cheap by construction, not by mocking.** The guard sits inside the ref loop, before
the range is computed, so every refusing leg exits before either expensive half is
reached. The non-refusing legs feed a ref line whose range is empty, so both halves
are correctly skipped. The sandbox holds no ``web/`` or ``src/gideon`` path
either, so nothing there can pull in ``npm ci``. Nothing is stubbed.

**Vacuity.** :func:`test_the_refusal_is_attributable_to_the_guard` reruns the exact
stdin of the negative leg against a copy of the script whose *own* condition is
neutered to ``if false``, and asserts that copy exits 0. So the negative leg's red is
attributable to the guard rather than to any other non-zero exit the script can
produce, and the substitution is asserted to have applied — a rename of that line
reds this test instead of silently making it vacuous.

── 2. Scope, after a rebase (issue 2269) ──────────────────────────────────────

**Measured gap (2026-09-01).** The range was ``remote_sha..local_sha``, which answers
"what changed between these two commits" — the same question as "what does this branch
add" only while the branch is a fast-forward of its remote. A rebase strands the old
remote tip, and the range then spans every ``main`` commit in between. Measured on a
real three-file backend-only branch: **94 frontend files in that range, versus 0 the
branch touches.** The gate ran ``npm ci`` → typecheck → vitest → build →
``playwright install`` → render-smoke for ten minutes and then failed on a web-suite
timeout in a file the diff could not reach.

Rebasing before a push is routine, and branches here are rebased for you, so this was
the common case. The fix scopes by ``merge-base(local_sha, origin/main)`` and keeps the
old range only as the answer for a clone that has no ``origin/main``.

**Where the falsification lives.** The behavioural leg is
:func:`test_a_rebased_backend_only_branch_skips_the_frontend_chain`; its floor is
:func:`test_a_branch_that_really_changes_the_frontend_still_gates`, because "scope it
more narrowly" is one step from "scope it to nothing" and a gate that never fires is
indistinguishable from a fast one. :func:`test_the_merge_base_is_preferred_over_the_remote_tip`
pins the ORDER rather than the presence of either range — swapping the two rungs leaves
both lines in the file and every sandbox leg green, since the sandboxes that exercise
the fallback have no ``origin/main`` for the first rung to win with.
