"""LV-7 — the skill-impact benchmark: register, preflight, reports and V4 reproduction.

Isolation: every test that touches state sets ``GIDEON_HOME`` to a ``tmp_path``.

``test_home_is_isolated`` asserts the redirect rather than trusting it — a suite that silently
ran against ``~/.gideon`` would write benchmark reports into the operator's real home.
