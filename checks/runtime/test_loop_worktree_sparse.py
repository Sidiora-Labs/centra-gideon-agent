"""Sparse + pooled + reused worktree hydration (HARNESS-CRAFT HC-2).

Drives REAL git against temp repos, because every claim in HC-2 is a claim about what
git actually does, and the interesting behaviours are the ones a mock would paper over:

* An out-of-cone write lands on disk, but ``git add -A`` then refuses it and stages
  NOTHING (exit 1) — and ``merge_worktree`` discards that exit code, so the work vanishes
  while the merge reports success. The widening tests therefore assert the file is IN THE
  RESULTING COMMIT, never that a widen command was issued.
* "Sparse" is only meaningful if something is genuinely ABSENT, so each sparse test
  first asserts an out-of-scope path is missing. Without that floor, a full checkout
  would satisfy every other assertion in the file.
* The pool bound is asserted as a NUMBER under a monkeypatched ``cpu_count``, both above
  and below the ceiling — on an 18-core dev box an unbounded pool would look identical
  to a bounded one.

Every worktree, branch and repo lives under ``tmp_path``; ``config_dir`` is redirected
so the worktrees root never touches a real Gideon home.
