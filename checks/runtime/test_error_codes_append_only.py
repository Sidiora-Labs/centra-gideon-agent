"""Append-only guard for the §2 AgentError code registry (PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY §2).

A shipped ``ERROR_CODES`` key is a STABLE surface: an agent — and the saved
prompts/SOPs it writes — branch on the code, never on the prose. So once a code
is released it is never removed or reworded; new failure paths ADD a code. This
suite is the enforcement the plan's §2.1 comment promises ("test asserts no
removal/redefinition").

The mechanism is a frozen baseline (:data:`_RELEASED`) embedded here: the set of
codes + meanings released as of this slice. The live registry MUST be a superset
whose baseline entries match byte-for-byte. Adding a code = add a row to
``ERROR_CODES`` (the baseline is untouched → still a subset → still green).
Removing or rewording one = the baseline entry no longer matches → red, which is
the whole point. When a genuinely new batch of codes is *released* (not merely
merged), they graduate into this baseline in the same change.

Also asserts the convention that keeps this registry from colliding with the
INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE §2.2 HTTP error envelope: agent codes are
``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE``; HTTP codes are ``lowercase_snake``. The two never overlap by
construction, so a consumer always knows which surface a code belongs to.
