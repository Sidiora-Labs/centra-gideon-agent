"""decomposition_to_stage_plan must keep EVERY approved phase as its own gating stage,
even when several share a canonical stage id. A code decomposition routinely emits 5
"implementation" phases (P1..P5) with distinct titles; the engine keys a phase by its
stage id (sdlc.phase_key), so identical ids collapse to one key — active_stage_index
never advances past the first and the worker grinds P1 to the cycle budget (observed live
on a TicTacToe build). The projection disambiguates repeats: implementation,
implementation-2, … — distinct keys, recognizably the same stage, verification untouched."""
