"""DFE-4 — the binary artifact write path and the document model read/render pair.

Three routes land here: ``PUT /api/artifacts/{slug}/raw`` (bytes in),
``GET /api/artifacts/{slug}/model`` (structure out) and
``PUT /api/artifacts/{slug}/model`` (structure in, re-rendered server-side). This suite
asserts each of the atom's six clauses **at the route**, not at the mechanism: a test
proving :func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error` works, or that
``update_binary(expect_version=…)`` raises, would say nothing about whether these
handlers call them.

**Two clauses need more than a status code, and both are written that way.**

*"An oversized body is refused BEFORE buffering."* A test that posts a big body and
reads a 413 cannot tell a pre-check from a post-check — both answer 413, and the
post-check has already spent the memory. So the load-bearing test drives the handler
with a request whose body **raises if anything reads it**
(:class:`_ExplodingPayload`): the refusal can only be produced from ``Content-Length``,
because reading is fatal. A second test then proves the same refusal fires through the
real router with a real body, so the mocked-request test is not the only evidence.

*"Exactly ONE version, ONE SEL row."* Both are counted, never merely present: two
versions per save silently doubles a document's history, and two audit rows split one
action's trail across two entries. ``== 1``, not ``>= 1``.

Every refusal test has a matching acceptance so no guard can pass by refusing
everything, and the SEL these tests read is ``tests/conftest.py``'s per-test temp log —
a leak into the real ``~/.gideon`` fails conftest's own rail.
