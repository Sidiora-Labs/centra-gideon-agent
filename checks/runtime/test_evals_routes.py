"""ES-4 — the judge tier-recommendation table's HTTP surface.

`GET /api/evals/judge-bench` is read-only ON PURPOSE and the tests say so: the full shipped
matrix is 540 judge calls, so a POST that started one would spend real money on a click and
hold a request open for minutes. The run is `gideon judge-bench`.

The load-bearing assertions are the two refusals. "No benchmark has run yet" and "the eval
substrate is off" are both 404s, and they carry DIFFERENT stable codes — one code for both
would make the panel's empty state a guess, and the panel does branch on the code to decide
between guidance and a load failure.
