"""Hazard-site audit for the two spawns PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1.1 named (SH1.5).

§1.1 named two spawn sites as candidates for the *pre-existing* form of the fork-wedge bug —
a spawn reached off a thread while the event loop / another thread holds locks, that could
wedge holding inherited fds:

  (a) ``apps/backend_runtime.py`` — the watchdog daemon thread respawns app backends
      (``BackendSupervisor.start`` is called from ``_check_and_revive`` on a 30s timer).
  (b) ``action_providers/bash_provider.py`` — a bash-action spawn on the event-loop thread.

The audit outcome (recorded here as executable assertions, per the done-when "a regression
test for a proven wedge, or a recorded finding that the sites are safe and why"):

**Both sites are SAFE — and PHF-1 makes them safer.** The wedge in §1.1 is specifically a
``preexec_fn`` hazard: only ``preexec_fn`` forces the ``fork()``-of-a-multithreaded-process
that can wedge before ``exec`` while holding inherited fds. Neither site ever passed
``preexec_fn`` (there are zero on the whole tree — see ``test_spawn_preexec_guard``), so
neither could exhibit the pre-exec wedge. PHF-1's ceiling delivery is post-``exec`` (the
shim), which is why it does NOT reintroduce the hazard at either site:

  * (a) backend respawn uses argv-prepend (``spawn_shim_argv``) + a plain ``subprocess.Popen``
    with no ``preexec_fn`` — the ceiling is applied by the shim in the exec'd child, so the
    watchdog thread's ``Popen`` cannot run agent bytecode pre-exec and cannot wedge on a
    lock. (A ``preexec_fn`` here would fork the whole gateway from the daemon thread — the
    exact hazard §1.1 warned about — which is why we route via argv, not preexec_fn.)
  * (b) the bash action spawn goes through ``create_subprocess_limited`` (async, no
    preexec_fn), so it stays on ``posix_spawn`` and the event loop is never blocked on a
    forked child's errpipe read.

These tests assert the safety-relevant invariants at each site so a future change that
reintroduces ``preexec_fn`` (or drops the shim routing) reds CI here as well as in the
preexec guard.
