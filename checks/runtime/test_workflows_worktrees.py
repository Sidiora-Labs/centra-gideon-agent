"""Tests for code-kind run worktrees (WORK-CONTAINERS §4.1, S52).

These use a REAL git repo rather than mocked subprocess calls, because the properties under test are
facts about git's behaviour, not about our wrappers. Two of them were measured before any code was
written:

* `add_worktree` on an existing id returns the SAME path rather than failing — which is what makes
  resume free rather than something to implement.
* An untracked `.env` is genuinely ABSENT from a fresh worktree. That is why `preserve_patterns` is
  adoption-critical: a worktree where every build fails reads to a user as "isolation is broken".

The defect this module's tests exist to pin: the review diff listed the preserved `.env` and the
engine's own `.gideon-setup/` markers as user changes. A review panel full of machinery is
one the user
skims, with the file that mattered in the same list.
