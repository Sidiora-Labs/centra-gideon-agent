"""The executor — drain, run, classify (§3 / §1.3 — S90).

§3's fire path ends: "… engine executes under the `headless` profile → **outcome
classification (§1.3)** →
delivery contract → health rollup + failure policy." S86 built the gate order, S87 the store,
S88 the
tick, S89 the dispatcher; this is the last link.

**Two honesty contracts this module inherits rather than invents**, both already fought for in
shipped
code and both re-verified here:

1. **The `_STATUS_PENDING` sentinel.** `schedule._execute` seeds `last_status = "_pending"`
and defaults
   to `"ok"` ONLY if the sentinel survived — its own comment: "so a failed action's 'error' is
   no longer
   CLOBBERED by an unconditional 'ok' (the honest-status bug T7 set out to kill: a failed run
   recorded as
   success)".
2. **`launched` is not success.** `engine.dispatch_action`: "'launched' means background work
STARTED, not
   that it succeeded … Reporting it as success would make a fire-and-forget action look
   verified." S84's
   history projection maps it to `deferred` too. This is the third surface to preserve it.

Every drain test uses a real `SessionManager` inbox and the real `dequeue` (which skips
cancelled rows).
