"""MC-2 — the CONSUMPTION side of COMPANION-APPS' device session, at the HTTP boundary.

MC-2 builds no mechanism. Pairing, the durable session row, the registry route and the
Settings → Devices panel are all CA-1/CA-2's, merged already; this module asserts the two
clauses a *phone* depends on, and both of them live in the middleware rather than in the store
that CA-2's tests exercise:

* **Roaming IP** — plan 54 §C1's transport constraint says a device session rides the session
  **cookie**, and the cookie branch skips IP binding outright (``not from_cookie`` guards both
  :func:`check_token_ip` and :func:`bind_token_ip` in ``token_auth.token_auth_middleware``). So a
  phone that changes carrier or Wi-Fi keeps its session with zero ``token_auth.py`` change. That
  is free *today* and silently broken the day someone binds cookie sessions too — which is
  exactly what COMPANION-APPS' ``CA-3`` log flagged as "worth an atom of its own". This is it.

* **Revocation** — CA-2 asserts revoke through :func:`token_auth.validate_token`. A phone never
  calls ``validate_token``; it makes an HTTP request. Between the two sit the bypass lists, the
  cookie branch and the adopt-from-store path, any of which could keep a revoked device alive
  while the validator already says no. MC-2's clause is worded "on the next **request**", so it
  is asserted as a request.

Every leg drives the real middleware over a real ``TestServer`` with a ``DummyCookieJar``, so a
request carries a credential only when that credential is named in the call — no leg can pass by
inheriting a cookie from an earlier one.

The clauses that are already met on ``main`` are deliberately NOT re-asserted here: the Settings →
Devices columns (name/kind/minted/last-seen/issuer + Revoke) are covered by
``web/src/pages/settings/devicesPanel.test.tsx`` and ``test_device_pairing.py``'s registry tests.
