"""Tests for the knowledge graph's server-side 2-D projection.

The properties under test are the ones the graph canvas depends on and that a reader of the
output cannot check for themselves: the layout is reproducible across sessions, no item is
ever silently dropped, an unplaceable vector is visibly at the origin instead of at NaN, and
distance on screen means distance in embedding space.

Every exclusion assertion here carries a positive control in the same test — an empty or
all-origin result must never be able to satisfy "these points are not at the origin".
