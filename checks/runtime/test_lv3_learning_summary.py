"""LV-3 (LEARNING-VISIBILITY T2.3): the learning summary block.

The atom's ``done_when`` is "the fallback skills-page header shows the learning block with
real counts and names". "Real" is the whole load: a block that renders zeros because it
reads a key nothing writes is the defect this file exists to prevent. So every group is
seeded through its **production writer** — ``create_auto_skill`` / ``update_auto_skill``
for skill provenance, ``overlays.apply_overlay`` for a sidecar refinement,
``proposals.enqueue`` for the pending queue, ``upsert_facet`` and ``write_lesson`` for the
facts — and then read back through ``compose_learning_summary``.

Every store is redirected under ``tmp_path``; the redirect is ASSERTED rather than
assumed, because ``skills_dir()`` resolves ``config_dir`` through the loader module and a
patch that missed it would write into the real ``~/.gideon``.
