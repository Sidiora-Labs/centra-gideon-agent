"""Tests for the task-pool concurrency semantics (TASKS-SOPS §5 R10, R7, R16 — S60).

Two things were MEASURED before this module asserted anything.

**`TaskComplete` is a declared hook event that nothing fires.** `hooks.HOOK_EVENTS` contains it,
`validation.py` allowlists it, the hook UI renders it with `_LIFECYCLE_BASE_VARS` — and a repo-wide
search for `fire(` finds exactly one call site (`fire_tool_hooks`). So a user could configure a
"when a task finishes" hook that would never run. A test below pins the *fireability* of the payload
this module builds, and the event-name constant is asserted equal to the shipped one so a rename
cannot silently create a second vocabulary.

**Acyclicity is already server-authoritative.** `tasks/native.py` calls
`reconcile.would_create_cycle` on BOTH create (line ~245) and update (line ~311). The plan's "the
server-side write path adds the authoritative check" was already satisfied, so `plan_edges`
delegates to that function instead of shipping a second DFS — and a test asserts the delegation, not
a reimplementation, because two cycle checkers means the looser one lets a deadlock through.
