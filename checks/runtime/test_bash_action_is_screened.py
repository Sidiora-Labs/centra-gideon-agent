"""A bash ACTION runs `/bin/sh -c` and was never screened; the interactive path always is.

`action_providers/bash_provider` executes `action_config["command"]` verbatim. `hooks.py:422`
and the native bash tool both call `security.is_sensitive_bash_command` first — an ACTION
reached neither. So `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` was refused when typed at the agent and executed when
carried in a cron.

**Why that is reachable, not theoretical.** `snapshot._merge_crons` appends an imported job
VERBATIM — no field is inspected — so restoring an archive installed whatever bash action it
held.
The same hole is open to the HTTP API, the UI, and any app that can create a trigger.

**Why the fix is at the executor, not at import.** Screening in `_merge_crons` would cover the one
creator that happened to be noticed. Screening where the command becomes a process covers
every creator, present and future, and matches what the interactive path already does.
