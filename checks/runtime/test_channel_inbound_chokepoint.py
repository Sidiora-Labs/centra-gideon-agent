"""EA-7 — the guarded inbound chokepoint (``gideon.channel_inbound``).

``channel_trust.guard_inbound`` shipped complete and with ZERO production callers: every
transport was expected to call it at the top of its own inbound path, by convention. A
transport that simply omitted the call reached a live agent session with no check, and
nothing in core noticed — fail-OPEN in aggregate for a control whose entire purpose is to
be fail-closed.

So the load-bearing test here is the NEGATIVE one: an inbound message from an unpaired
sender must not reach a session. Each negative is paired with a positive that would fail
if the door were simply broken (a paired sender DOES get through), because a negative test
passes just as well when nothing works at all.
