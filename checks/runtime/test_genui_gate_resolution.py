"""A genui FORM widget emitted by a workflow gate resolves the gate and the run ADVANCES.

AMBIENT-SURFACES §5.4 / atom AS-6, second routing case: *"workflow-emitted widgets (a skill
or workflow node emits a genui tree as a gate's prompt) → the action resolves the run's
wait/gate node through the resume-target path — closing the loop from generated UI back into
execution."*

🪤 THE TEST THIS ATOM COULD HAVE SHIPPED INSTEAD. A test that asserts "the resolver was
called" — or that calls `run_to_completion` again by hand after resuming — stays GREEN while
the run never moves. `controller.resume`'s own comment records that exact defect: the answer
landed, the node flipped DONE, and the run "sat there forever with its downstream nodes never
launched", because every unit test drove the loop itself afterwards. So every test here
resumes and then WAITS for the run's own loop, and asserts the POST-GATE node produced its
output. Nothing in this file drives the engine after the answer.

The gate's prompt carries the widget markup the FE renders (`<widget kind="genui">`), which
is why the prompt is asserted to survive the round trip intact: the FE detects the block in
`ask.prompt` (`findGenUiBlock`) and, when it is there, renders the tree with THIS gate
declared as the action producer. A prompt the engine rewrote would leave the FE rendering the
tree as text.
