"""Every config write path validates through the SAME allowlist, and refuses out loud.

`_EDITABLE_CONFIG` + the PATCH handler were the only real validation in the tree: typed,
bounded, allowlisted, SEL-audited on every rejection. Three other paths wrote
`config.json` beside it, each with its own idea of what a valid value is:

* **`PUT /api/memory/settings`** coerced instead of validating. `bool("false")` is `True`,
  so a request to turn a memory behaviour OFF turned it ON; `push_min_confidence: 42` was
  clamped to `1.0` (the push reflex silently switched from "volunteer at 42% confidence" to
  "never volunteer") where PATCH would have returned 400 for the same field. It had no
  allowlist, so a typo'd key returned 200 having changed nothing, and no SEL row at all.
* **`PUT /api/config/gideon`** re-implemented the bounds of three `agent.*` fields
  `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` already declares — identical numbers, one edit from disagreeing — and
  dropped unknown keys in silence whenever one recognised key rode along.
* **`gideon config set`** checked only that the dotted key EXISTS in `to_dict()`,
  then wrote any value, so the CLI could store `agent.max_subagents 9999` past the 0..16
  the API enforces on the very same field.

The common defect is not "a missing check" — it is **a write that reports success having
done something other than what was asked**. Nothing downstream can notice that, which is
why these are asserted at the call site (real handlers through a real `TestClient`, the
real CLI entry point) and why the SEL row is part of each assertion: an unaudited silent
drop is indistinguishable from a working save.

Each behaviour test is paired with the case that must still WORK, because "validate
everything" is one `return 400` away from an endpoint that saves nothing at all.
