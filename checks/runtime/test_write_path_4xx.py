"""The rail for "a wrong TYPE must be a 4xx — never a 500, never a silent mutation" (#766,
#770, #427, #424).

**Not one primitive — one principle.** These four endpoints each mishandled a wrong-typed field, and
each wanted a DIFFERENT correct answer: a 400 for a chat message, coerce-or-ignore for a display
order, ignore-don't-delete for an agent's tool list, and stringify-don't-poison for event metadata.
A
single shared validator would have been the wrong shape for at least three of them.

What they share is that **every one of them had the right answer already written in a sibling**, and
the issues each name it. So each fix adopts its own local precedent rather than inventing a rule:

======  ==================================  ============================================
#766    `POST /api/chat`                    `meta`, four lines below, checks `isinstance`
#770    `PATCH /api/chat/folders/{id}`      `chat_tags.py`'s tag + column updates
#427    `PATCH /api/agents/detail/{name}`    the create path and `PUT /api/agents/{name}`
#424    `clean_event_metadata`               its own docstring's "bounded scalar" promise
======  ==================================  ============================================

A fifth was verified ALREADY FIXED and is not re-fixed here: `POST /api/memory/import` (#591) has
the `isinstance(body, dict)` guard the issue asks for.
