"""LV-4's schedule half: the clock job, the cadence, and what ``off`` actually stops.

`checks/runtime/test_lv4_identity_report.py` covers the composition and delivery half. This file covers
the three clauses that were left `todo`, and each one is written against the failure it exists to
catch rather than against the code that implements it:

1. **"compressed-clock fixture fires the job."** The proof is that the report is *PRODUCED*, not
   that a row was armed. A whole trigger subsystem in this repo once shipped where every fire
   reached a mailbox nobody opened, so an "enqueued" assertion is worth nothing here. Two legs:
   the armed row is SELECTED by the real ``service.due_ids`` when a compressed clock passes its
   fire time, and driving it through the real ``RuntimeCoordinator._fire_store_trigger`` leaves a
   versioned artifact and one inbox row on disk.

2. **"cadence monthly | weekly | off."** Asserted as a CONVERGENCE (a cadence change reaches the
   spec without the user touching a trigger) and as ONE vocabulary — the same three words in
   `learning_report`, in the PATCH allowlist and in the frontend strip, compared to each other
   rather than to three hand-written copies.

3. **"`off` disables cleanly."** Two independent refusals, and they must fail INDEPENDENTLY of the
   weekly legs or the pair is measuring one thing: the reconciler disables the row (so nothing is
   selected) *and* ``execute`` returns before composing anything (so a row a user re-enabled by
   hand still produces nothing). "Fires and discards" is not a pass — the artifact store and the
   inbox are both inspected for absence, against a seeded home that WOULD have produced a report.

Plus the two round-trip points `test_config_roundtrip.py` provably cannot see: the write path (the
real PATCH handler, end to end onto disk and back through ``AppConfig.load``) and the frontend
control (asserted at its call site here, and driven by a click in
`apps/console/src/features/learning/identityReportCadence.test.tsx`).

🔴 **One DISCOVERY drove a change to shipped code.** ``delivery_dedup_key`` was hardcoded to the
calendar month, and `emit_attention_item` returns the existing open row and fires no second
notification for a repeated key — so weeks 2, 3 and 4 of every month would have written a new
artifact version and told nobody. It is keyed on the report's own period now, and both directions
are railed below.
