"""`foreach` item-error policies — three members, three different run-level outcomes (WV-13).

`ItemErrorPolicy.COLLECT` shipped as a DECLARED STRATEGY WITH NO EXECUTOR: `models.py` declared
it, `validator.py` accepted it and `service.capabilities` advertised it to authoring models,
while the derivation branched on `HALT` and `SKIP` only. Nothing was visibly broken, so nothing
found it for the length of the engine program.

So the load-bearing assertions here are the ones a "COLLECT exists" test could never make:

* **three policies, three DIFFERENT observables** for the same seeded failing item, driven
  through the real controller/tick path — a fan-out that halts and fails, one that runs
  everything and completes, and one that runs everything and fails;
* **the exhaustiveness ratchet** — every member of the enum has its own branch in
  `tick.foreach_outcome`, proven both by driving each member and by reading the branches out of
  the source, and the unreachable tail RAISES so a fourth member added later cannot silently
  inherit a neighbour's behaviour;
* **the collected failures reach the ledger** — COLLECT's contract is "run everything, then hand
  me the failures", and a FAILED run that does not say which of its items broke has collected
  nothing.
