"""A dispatched `stage` node's completion must have a CONSUMER.

`engine.dispatch_stage` spawns a subagent and returns `RUNNING` carrying
`{"subagent_id": info.id}` (``engine.py:779``). Nothing read that key, so a stage node
never left `RUNNING`: `_await_progress` pops the finished asyncio task out of
`_inflight` (``controller.py:2686``) before `_apply` runs, and once `_inflight` is empty
the tick loop takes the `else` branch at ``controller.py:573`` and yields on
`asyncio.sleep(0)` forever — which also means `_await_progress`, the ONLY caller of
`_enforce_stall_timeouts` (``controller.py:2682``), stops being called at all. Measured in
`SELF-VERIFICATION.md:430-441`: a node stayed RUNNING for fifteen minutes after its
subagent reported `done: True`.

These tests assert the CALL SITE, not a helper in isolation: the whole defect was that no
code path ever asked the subagent manager whether the spawn had finished. Every test here
except `test_an_unknown_subagent_id_does_not_invent_a_verdict` (the fail-safe guard, which
is vacuous until the reconciliation exists) reds against unmodified `main`.
