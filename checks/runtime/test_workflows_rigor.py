"""Tests for the cheap end of the rigor axis (UP-R10, S45).

This module exists to keep spec-driven planning from becoming a waterfall, so its tests are mostly
about restraint: Specify emits exactly one stage, the fast path schedules its refinement gate after
the first OUTPUT rather than at the end, and the acceptance ratchet only ever grows.

The ratchet's direction is the load-bearing property. A criteria list that can shrink is one where a
later revision silently drops the check an earlier failure earned — and nothing in the diff says so,
because the spec still looks like a spec with criteria.
