"""One owner for "where is THIS instance's gateway" — and it refuses rather than guessing.

Issue #2539. ``gideon gateway --port N`` moved where the gateway LISTENS but not what
its children believed the server's address WAS. Each child resolved that for itself — from
``parse_dashboard_url(dashboard.url)`` or from the import-time ``config.loader.DASHBOARD_PORT``
— and both fall back to the fixed ``10000``. ``dashboard.url`` is ``""`` in a default config,
so this was the DEFAULT path, not an edge case.

The consequence is not a hang. Something is listening on ``10000``: on a multi-gateway host
that is a DIFFERENT instance, with its own home, config and state. Measured end to end on two
isolated homes before the fix — instance B (bound ``127.0.0.1:10771``) fired a ``run-script``
action whose ``ctx.notify()`` was persisted into instance A's ``notifications.jsonl`` (bound
``127.0.0.1:10772``); B's own store stayed empty, the child reported ``{'ok': True}``, and B's
``.local_secret`` travelled to A in the request header.

These tests pin both halves of the fix:

* the resolution has ONE owner (``gateway_base``) fed by the socket the gateway actually bound,
  and the rail at the bottom reds when a new site learns to resolve the base on its own;
* an unresolvable base is a loud, fast refusal that names its cause — never ``10000``. Per ARCC
  SAX-04 Outcome 5, *"failing open for security-critical operations"* is a named pitfall and a
  system must *"fail fast rather than hanging indefinitely on timeout"*.
