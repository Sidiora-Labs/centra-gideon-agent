"""The MRT-5 seam: `route_refs` actually consults the learned stage.

Three thirds of MRT-5 were built on fenced branches and every one of them was green in
isolation. What no branch could show is that `policy.route_refs` reaches the scoring stage at
all — `policy.py` said "``learned`` lands here too until MRT-5 scores the fold" and the whole
atom is the removal of that sentence. A learned stage nothing calls is the "declared mode
without a runtime" this atom exists to close, so it is asserted here rather than assumed.

Every test drives the REAL `route_refs` against a real fold on a `tmp_path` home. Nothing here
touches `~/.gideon`.
