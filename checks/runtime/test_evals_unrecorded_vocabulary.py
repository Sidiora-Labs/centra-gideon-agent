"""The rail for ONE vocabulary of "unrecorded" across the eval report (#2540 / #2561 / #2562).

Three fields in one report collapsed *absent* into *zero/none*, and the fix was one word
(``unrecorded``, owned by :mod:`gideon.evals.provenance` and mirrored in
``web/src/lib/unrecorded.ts``) plus the rule that every consumer of a field that CAN be unrecorded
must consult the fact that says whether it was. This file is what makes the second half stick:

1. :func:`test_the_consumer_set_is_pinned` — the derived {file: guarded fields} map must equal the
   declared one. A NEW consumer, or an existing file starting to read a new guarded field, reds
   here and its author has to come read the rule.
2. :func:`test_every_guarded_read_consults_the_not_recorded_fact` — each consumer in the
   learning-bench chain must carry its required guard token.
3. :func:`test_one_spelling_of_the_word` — Python, TypeScript and the dev harness spell it the
   same, so the "one vocabulary" claim is checked rather than promised.

**Enumerate with git, parse with Python.** ``git ls-files`` lists the tracked files and this module
reads only the paths it returns. Nothing here walks a directory: a broad traversal from a bare root
resolves into credential-holding paths and is refused by host policy, and swapping the reader for
``glob``/``os.walk`` hits the same family.

**Both vacuity floors.** :func:`test_the_detector_reds_on_a_planted_violation` proves the predicate
can fail, and :func:`test_the_detector_is_not_green_from_matching_nothing` proves it is not green by
matching zero sites — with an absolute lower bound and a hand-written list of literal sites, neither
of which comes from the same parse that derives the expected map.
