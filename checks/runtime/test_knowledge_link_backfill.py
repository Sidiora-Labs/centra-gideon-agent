"""The entity-link backfill — KL-14 clause 7's third job (the "graph linker backfill").

`maintenance_passes.py` shipped the host with two of three jobs and recorded the third unmet
because no callable existed. `link_backfill.link_backfill_pass` is that callable, and it runs
under `batched=True`, meaning the host re-invokes it until it returns 0. That contract is what
these tests are really about.

The risks they target, in order of how badly each one bites:

* **A backlog that cannot drain.** The obvious backlog definition — "items with no `mentions`
  rows" — does not terminate: an item may legitimately name no known entity, so it never gains
  a mention, never leaves the backlog, and is re-claimed on every tick. The host would spend
  every sub-batch on the head of the library and never reach the tail.
  `test_unlinkable_item_still_leaves_the_backlog` and
  `test_repeated_calls_drain_the_backlog_then_return_zero` are that assertion.
* **Burning the backlog against an empty graph.** A sweep is once-per-item, so sweeping a
  fresh library before any entity exists would mark everything looked-at while linking nothing
  — and those items could then never be linked. `test_no_entities_writes_nothing_at_all`.
* **A silent no-op.** A pass that reports progress while writing no `mentions` rows is
  indistinguishable from the gap it closes, so the linking tests assert on the DB rows rather
  than on the return value.
* **Holding the store for a whole library.** `test_one_call_processes_at_most_batch_size`.
