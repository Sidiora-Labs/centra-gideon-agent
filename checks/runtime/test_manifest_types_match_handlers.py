"""The test five source comments and eighteen roadmap docs already cite by name.

`apps/manifest.py` says of `PROVIDER_TYPES`:

    NOTE: this set MUST equal the runtime type-handler registry
    (providers/registry.py register_type_handler(...) calls). … `prompt` was a registered
    handler (PromptTypeHandler) but was missing here (#47) — so `ProviderConfig.validate()`
    rejected any prompt provider manifest, blocking reinstall/update + third-party prompt
    providers. native-prompts is native (auto-seeded, bypasses install-time validation), which
    masked it. test_manifest_types_match_handlers guards this equality going forward.

**It did not exist.** `providers/registry.py` cites it three times ("the bug class
`test_manifest_types_match_handlers` exists to prevent"), `workflows/defs.py` once, and eighteen
docs under `docs/` name it. A repo-wide grep found zero implementations. The 19 = 19 equality was
true today and unguarded — held by luck, with a #47 recurrence one forgotten line away.

Both directions matter, and they fail differently:

* **declared but unregistered** — the manifest accepts a type nothing can instantiate, so an app
  installs and then does nothing;
* **registered but undeclared** — the #47 shape: a working handler whose manifests are rejected at
  validation, invisible while only a native (auto-seeded) provider uses it.
