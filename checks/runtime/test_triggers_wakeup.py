"""The WakeupDispatcher — inbox + wakeup with `wake`/`resume` semantics (§3.2 — S89).

§3.2: "A fired trigger enqueues a typed payload onto the target session's inbox queue + a
wakeup signal;
a **WakeupDispatcher** claims and drives runs. … **wake** — drain inbox; skipped entirely if
the session
is already running … **resume** — a gate-answer/HITL result for a parked run; **must re-queue
until the
parked lock releases** — overlap guards must never eat gate answers intended for parked runs."

**Two hazards measured in the shipped `enqueue` before this module existed**, both invisible
to reading:

1. It DROPS the payload for an idle session — returns False and appends nothing unless the
semaphore is
   locked or `force=True`. A 3am cron fires precisely when the session is idle, so an unforced
   enqueue
   would silently lose the fires this subsystem delivers.
2. It returns False when the session does not exist, which is normal for a trigger whose session was
   never opened. So "could not queue" is REPORTED rather than assumed to be a delivery.

Every test drives a real `SessionManager`. A mock cannot show either hazard, because both live in
`enqueue`'s own branch on `session.semaphore.locked()`.
