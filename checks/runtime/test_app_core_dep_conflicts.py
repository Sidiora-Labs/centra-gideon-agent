"""An app may not re-pin a dependency core owns (EI-12 D3).

App ``pythonDependencies`` are pip-installed into the **shared** venv the gateway is
running out of, so a pin pip can only satisfy by moving a core dependency changes the
gateway's own dependency set — under a live process that already imported those
modules. ``app_manager._reject_core_dependency_conflicts`` refuses that class of pin
before anything is installed.

Why this shape rather than the plan's original "app-scoped target" isolation: measured
over the 44 first-party manifests, **zero** apps have both a backend and declared
``pythonDependencies`` — the two apps with a backend (``growth``, ``minutes``) declare
none, and all 20 dep-declaring apps are in-process provider apps. So a backend-scoped
``PYTHONPATH`` would isolate an empty population while the real shadowing risk (the
in-process providers) stayed open. Isolating those needs out-of-process providers, an
owner-scope seam change recorded BLOCKED in the plan. Refusing the conflict is the part
that makes the property true without redefining the provider seam.

Every assertion here runs through the real installer entry point, and the pip
subprocess is replaced with one that FAILS the test if it is ever reached — a refusal
that still spawned pip would not be a refusal.
