"""A dismissed Discover tip has to be a real tip (issue 317).

``POST /api/legibility/discover/dismiss`` validated that ``id`` was *present* and never that
it was a tip. Measured against `origin/main` by calling the real write path:

    dismiss("chat")                     -> ['chat']
    dismiss("definitely-not-a-tip")     -> ['chat', 'definitely-not-a-tip']
    dismiss("<script>alert(1)</script>") -> stored verbatim
    dismiss("x" * 200_000)              -> a 200 KB entity_settings/legibility.json

Two things the filed report did not measure:

* **One request, not an accumulation.** The API app's ceiling is the single-POST threshold
  plus 16 MB, so a single dismissal could leave megabytes in that file — which
  :func:`load_dismissed` re-reads and re-parses on *every* Discover request.
* **A non-catalog id is inert.** With all of that junk dismissed, ``select_visible`` still
  returned the other nine tips: it only ever compares against catalog ids. So default-deny
  costs exactly nothing here — no id it refuses could ever have done anything.

ARCC was queried first (input validation is an explicit trigger domain). SAX-04 Outcome 1
is the direction taken: *"only explicitly allowed inputs should pass validation"*, with
*"using blacklist approaches instead of allowlist (default-deny) validation"* named as a
pitfall, and Outcome 2 adds validating at the earliest point and logging the failures. The
valid set here is closed, known and ten entries long, so the allowlist IS the catalog — a
format regex would be the weaker half of that guidance for no gain.

The 400 is safe as UX and is not asserted here: the frontend already wraps this call in
``reportingWrite('dismiss that tip', …)``, pinned by
``apps/console/src/pages/chat/dismissalFailureReported.test.ts``, so a refusal surfaces as an error
rather than an X that appears to work — and it can never fire from the UI at all, whose ids
come from the GET payload, i.e. from the catalog. Re-asserting it here would red two files
for one reason.
