"""Projecting a waiting run into the attention surfaces (WF2-R7, Slice 8c).

The gap this closes: before it, a run parking on `needs_input` appeared in exactly ONE place —
an SSE frame. So a gate only reached a human who already had the run view open, and a scheduled
run firing at 3am would park and never be mentioned anywhere. That is not a UI polish problem;
it is an unattended run silently waiting forever.

What the tests pin:

* a waiting gate raises a durable inbox row AND one notification, through `emit_attention_item`
  (the pairing seam) rather than two separate calls that could drift;
* **one row per question, not per poll** — the watchdog re-polls a waiting run every few
  seconds, so the dedup key is the load-bearing part;
* a rewind re-asking the same question is a NEW row, because it genuinely is a new ask;
* answering closes the row, and a run ENDING closes whatever it left open — a row that
  outlives its gate is unanswerable, and one unanswerable row teaches a user to ignore the
  inbox;
* nothing here can break a run. A gate is what a user is waiting on; losing the run to a
  bookkeeping failure would be strictly worse than losing the row.
