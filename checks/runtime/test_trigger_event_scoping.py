"""Agent-scoped event classification stays honest (issue 610).

`AGENT_SCOPED_EVENTS` is a reviewed constant like `DORMANT_EVENTS` beside it, and these
rails are its guard: the set must disagree with the GLOBAL fire path's own registry in
neither direction, and the variables endpoint must ship the flag so both UIs read one
server-sourced answer instead of inventing a second vocabulary.
