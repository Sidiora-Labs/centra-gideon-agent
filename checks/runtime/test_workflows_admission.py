"""The admission seam: tightest-wins composition and the two hold vocabularies (PP-11).

`checks/runtime/test_workflows_frontier_golden.py` proves the seam changed nothing. This module proves the
seam is a seam — that composition is by capacity rather than by position, that a tie between two
policies resolves toward the refusal that has a name, and that `PP-12` can add `Lease` here without
re-auditing the three rules already in the list.
