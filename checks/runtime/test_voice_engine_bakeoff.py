"""Tests for the voice-clone engine bake-off (MULTIMODAL-IO §2.2, atom MI-6).

These lock the harness's *honesty* contract as much as its verdict: raw values are
literature-or-unknown (never invented), scores are bounded judgments, an unknown metric
is excluded rather than guessed, and the measurement path skips with a clear reason
instead of fabricating a latency.
