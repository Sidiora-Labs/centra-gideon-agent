"""Tests for `publish:`, material-change gating and evidence bundles (WORK-CONTAINERS §2, S47).

The property carrying this module: **a declaration is a promise about output.** A malformed
`publish:` FAILS the node rather than degrading to "no publish" — a node whose author declared a
deliverable and silently produced nothing would report success, which is the completion-lie
class the
artifact gate exists to catch.

The asymmetry beside it: a REGISTRY failure does not fail the node. The work happened; losing
the copy
is worth reporting, not worth discarding a completed stage over. A bad declaration is the
author's bug
(fail loudly); a registry outage is the environment's (degrade honestly).

The second property is that material-change gating protects a finite resource. The artifact registry
keeps 50 snapshots; a refinement loop that published every round would consume the window in five
runs, so the window that exists to hold real revision history would hold near-duplicates.
