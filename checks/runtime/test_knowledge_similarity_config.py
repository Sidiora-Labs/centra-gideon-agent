"""KL-13: the similarity-edge knobs must round-trip through config, end to end.

The atom's clause is "the cosine floor, top-K and degree cap round-trip through config".
This file proves the WHOLE chain for each of the three fields, because every link has its own
failure mode and the project has shipped each of them at least once:

* dataclass + ``_meta``      — a field with no label/help is invisible in the settings UI
* ``load()``                 — the "round-tripped knob nothing reads" defect: the field is on
                               the dataclass and in ``to_dict()``, so a save/load test passes,
                               but ``load()`` never maps it, so a configured value silently
                               reverts to the default on the next read
* ``to_dict()``              — automatic via ``asdict``, which is exactly why it is asserted
                               rather than assumed
* ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG``       — without an entry the PATCH endpoint refuses the key
* a reader                   — the value must arrive at a caller that only sees
                               ``AppConfig.load()``

``config.json`` is hand-editable and ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG``'s bounds only guard the PATCH path,
so the hostile-value cases are tested too. The ZERO case and the NEGATIVE case are deliberately
SEPARATE tests: a single test written with ``0`` cannot tell the ``or <default>`` fallback apart
from a clamp, and it keeps passing with the clamp deleted.
