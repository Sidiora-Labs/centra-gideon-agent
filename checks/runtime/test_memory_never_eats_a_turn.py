"""A memory subsystem that is down degrades recall. It never kills the turn.

`build_session_context` reads four blocks from ONE subsystem. Three of them — preference profile,
self-model, procedural priors — each sat in their own `try/except`. The PRIMARY block did not:

    memory_ctx = _svc.get_context(**_memory_caps(active_chat_model_window()))

and `memory_service.get_context` has no internal guard either. So a raising vector store, a
locked sqlite file or a corrupt index did not thin the prompt — it killed the reply. The
asymmetry was the defect: four blocks, one subsystem, three of which could already fail safely.

These tests assert the CALL SITE (`build_session_context` returns a usable prompt while memory
raises — it is the function that owns the four reads; `build_message` is a different one, and
testing that would have measured nothing),
not that a helper swallows exceptions, and they include the vacuity check that matters here: the
guard must not be so wide that a WORKING memory stops being injected.
