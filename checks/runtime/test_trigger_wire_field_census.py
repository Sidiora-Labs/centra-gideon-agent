"""Every field the schedule-trigger form puts on the wire must be read by the handler.

Four issues on ONE seam, all the same shape — the form sends a field, the handler never reads it,
the request returns 200, and the setting the user chose is simply gone:

* issue 587 — `enabled` was sent at create and read by nobody, so "create it switched off" armed a
  live trigger.
* issue 689 — the reverse direction: the form described an action it could not edit, and the server
  dutifully applied it, destroying a `notify` action on rename.
* issue 272 — `skip_dates` was read by `_create_schedule` and preserved by `_carried` across a
  cadence change, but absent from `_update_schedule` entirely. A holiday list could be set once and
  never edited.
* issue 268 — `approval_mode` was dropped in the BROWSER: `_scheduleBodyToWire` destructures it as
  action config, and the create page's body already carried its own `action`, so the branch that
  returns early discarded it before any request was made.

Each was found by a human driving the UI and noticing a switch that would not stick. That is an
expensive way to find a one-line omission, and it scales with the number of fields. So this census
holds the two sets against each other in source: what the frontend SENDS, and what the handlers
READ. A new field wired into one side and not the other fails here instead of in someone's browser.

It is a source-text census, like `test_durability_inventory_census.py` — it parses rather than
imports, because the sending side is TypeScript and cannot be called from pytest. That makes the
extraction regexes load-bearing, which is why every region and every set below has a floor: if a
refactor moves a function or renames a variable so a pattern stops matching, the floor fails loudly
rather than reporting an empty diff as agreement.

🪤 THE FAKE VERSION OF THIS TEST asserts a hardcoded list of field names appears in
`triggers.py`. That passes forever while the frontend grows a field the backend never learns about
— which is the entire bug, four times over. The test has to derive BOTH sides from source and
compare them; a list written by hand only records what someone already knew.
