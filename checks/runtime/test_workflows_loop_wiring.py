"""WF2LOO-7 — the decision layers wired into the RunController tick.

These are the end-to-end assertions for LOOPS-EVOLUTION criteria 3 and 8, driven through a
real controller against a temp home with only the model call faked:

* **steering is consumed at the iteration boundary** (R14, criterion 8) — an instruction queued
  mid-run lands in the next iteration's prompt and is journaled as a `steering` ledger event,
  single-use;
* **judge verdicts reach the ledger with evidence** (R3, criterion 3) — a judge gate emits
  `judge_verdict` with its evidence chain and discard status, on both pass and reject;
* **a human override records `judge_divergence`** with the right direction;
* **a nodding loop is blocked from becoming its kind's default** (R6a) — a 100%-pass gate over
  enough runs fails `may_become_default`, a discriminating one passes;
* **the breaker is not double-run** — `resilience.check_breaker` remains the sole trip authority.
