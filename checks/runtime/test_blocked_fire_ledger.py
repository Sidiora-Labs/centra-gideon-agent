"""A screened payload leaves a typed ledger row (§7 criterion 8 — S136).

S134 wired the injection screen at the dispatch seam and recorded, in the plan, that the ledger
row was
**still owed**: that path is not a `tick` fire, so nothing wrote one.

🔴 WHY THAT MATTERED. Criterion 8: *"Every suppressed fire … appears as a typed ledger row with a
reason — zero silent drops."* A refusal only a log file knows about is a silent drop by that
definition. The user sees an automation that stopped and has nowhere to look; and because
`blocked_injection` **never auto-retries**, this row is the only record that will ever exist for
that
fire.

**The screened TEXT is deliberately not stored.** Criterion 11's discipline generalises: a blocked
payload is hostile third-party content, and copying it into a store the UI renders would move an
injection attempt out of a refused fire and into a surface a human reads. The matched GROUPS
name the
pattern class, which is what tells a real attack from a false positive.
