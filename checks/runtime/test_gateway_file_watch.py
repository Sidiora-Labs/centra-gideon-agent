"""The file-watch poll loop is wired into gateway boot (§3 / crit 2 — S93).

`file_poll` is tested as a library in `test_triggers_file_poll.py`; these tests pin the GATEWAY
adapter — that a file change routes to the trigger's declared action provider through the same
registry a cron uses, and that the loop is disjoint from `ScheduleService`. A runtime that polled
correctly but was never started, or fired through a second dispatch path, would be the
present-and-inert / drift defects this program keeps finding.
