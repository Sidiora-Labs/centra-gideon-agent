"""BA-4 — the browser-session credential handoff, and above all its ONE invariant.

    "the credentials-never-transit-the-agent invariant holds
     (the LLM never sees password / 2FA / token)"

That clause is the reason this file is organised the way it is. The other three clauses (park on
needs-input, resume with the session, a later run reuses the profile) are ordinary behaviour with
ordinary tests. The invariant is a NEGATIVE claim about every string in the system, and a negative
claim needs a different shape of test: not "does the redactor work" but "sweep every surface a
credential could reach and prove it is not there".

So ``TestTheInvariant`` runs full loops with a real credential planted on the real path and then
sweeps SIX surfaces at once — every prompt the model saw, the step ledger, the notes, the warnings
(which become the NEXT prompt), the run payload, and the log records. A test that checked only the
prompt would have passed against three of the four leaks found while writing this.

**Each guard has a control leg that proves it can fail.** They are named ``…_control`` and they are
not decoration: the invariant sweep asserts a string is ABSENT, and an absence assertion passes
trivially when the harness never put the string anywhere. Every control leg therefore drives the
SAME harness with a NON-credential field and asserts the value IS present on the same surfaces —
so a sweep that has stopped observing anything fails its control instead of quietly staying green.
