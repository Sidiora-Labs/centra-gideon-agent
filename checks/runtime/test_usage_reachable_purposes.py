"""``reachable_purposes()`` must match the writers that actually exist (MRT-3).

A spend chart that renders a row nothing can ever fill is not showing "no spend" — it is
showing a bucket with no writer, and the two read identically. ``PURPOSE_BY_SOURCE`` declares
five purposes; only some have a live turn-ledger writer, so :data:`UNWRITTEN_PURPOSES` names
the rest and this file keeps that list honest in BOTH directions:

* a purpose excluded as unwritten that in fact gains a writer  → the exclusion is now a LIE
  hiding real spend, which is the worse failure and the one this file exists to catch;
* a purpose advertised as reachable with no writer             → a permanent zero row.

The census reads the real ``record_from_event`` call sites out of the source, because the thing
under test is *which sources the code passes* — importing the modules would prove only that
they import.
