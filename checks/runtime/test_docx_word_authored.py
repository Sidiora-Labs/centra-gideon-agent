"""DFE-3's V1 gate clause: a fixture **Word** authored, reporting its losses honestly.

`tests/fixtures/word_authored.docx` was written by Microsoft Word (Word for Mac 16.111)
driven over AppleScript. It was not written by python-docx and its constructs were not
hand-injected as raw OOXML. That distinction is the entire point of the clause: a synthetic
fixture can only contain what its author remembered to inject, while a file Word saved
carries whatever Word puts in a document whether anybody thought of it or not — the
`w14:paraId`/`w14:textId` pair on every paragraph, the `w15`/`w16du` namespace family,
Word's own `numbering.xml` / `footnotes.xml` / `endnotes.xml` / `theme1.xml` parts, and
`w:sectPr` values from Word's template rather than python-docx's.

How it was produced, so it can be regenerated (all of step 2 through Word's own UI model):

1. `render_docx` wrote the base document: a title, a heading, a paragraph of formatted
   runs, two tables interleaved with paragraphs, a bulleted list and a numbered list.
2. Word opened that file and added a footnote, a tracked insertion inside the first
   table's first cell, and two more items typed at the end of the numbered list and then
   bulleted with the bullet button.
3. `remove personal information` and `remove date and time` were set on the document
   before saving, so **Word itself** replaced the revision author with "Author", blanked
   `dc:creator` / `cp:lastModifiedBy` and dropped `word/people.xml`. No byte was edited
   afterwards — the archive is Word's own output.

The suite makes four claims, in the order they can fail:

* the fixture really is Word's output and really carries no personal data
  (`test_the_word_provenance_markers_reject_a_python_docx_file` is the companion that
  proves those markers can fail — without it "the file has Word's marks" is unfalsifiable);
* everything the model **can** hold came back, including paragraph↔table document order on
  Word's XML rather than the writer's;
* every construct the model **cannot** hold is named in the report, and nothing else is —
  over-reporting is a failure mode too, and an exact kind set is what catches it;
* Word's own `w:numPr` outranks a contradicting style name, which is the defect this
  fixture found.
