"""Pairing codes are redeemable at the ONE gate every channel crosses (#950).

``channel_trust`` shipped the whole pairing mechanism — an owner CLI that mints a code, a
hash-only store, TTL, single-use, constant-time compare — and then left
:func:`~gideon.integrations.channel_trust.redeem_pairing_code` reachable only from the platform's
inbound door, which **no shipping channel crossed**. Telegram and Discord call
``guard_inbound`` directly and never redeemed; Slack crosses no trust seam at all; only
email hand-rolled its own copy. So ``gideon pair <provider>`` minted codes that
nothing could spend and the canned "ask my owner for an 8-digit pairing code" reply was an
infinite loop.

The fix puts redemption inside :func:`~gideon.integrations.channel_trust.guard_inbound`, on the
same principle that already puts the untrusted-content fence there: a per-transport
obligation is a hope, not a property.

**Every case here carries a vacuity floor.** A refusal test that passes because the setup
never produced a redeemable code proves nothing, so each negative case also asserts the
positive it is the negation of. And because "a validator with no production call site is a
dead fix" is this project's rule, the last section asserts the redemption is reached from a
non-test caller rather than trusting that it is.
