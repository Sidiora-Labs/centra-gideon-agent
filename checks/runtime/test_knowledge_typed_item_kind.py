"""`create_typed_item` writes the `kind` column for a SYNTHESIZED item_type.

`SYNTHESIZED_KINDS` is one vocabulary that was being asked of two different columns.
`semantics.check_persist` tests the **`kind`** column against it — the citation
requirement, whose whole reason for existing is that "an unsourced synthesis is
indistinguishable from a confident guess once it is in the store being retrieved as
fact". But `create_typed_item` never wrote `kind` at all, so every typed item read back
as the default `"fact"` (`updates.py`: `str(row.get("kind") or "") or "fact"`) and the
gate could not fire for it. A real control, silently inert.

What is asserted here is the CONTROL, not the column:

1. The gate now REFUSES an uncited synthesized item on the path a caller actually takes
   (`updates.propose_update`), and refuses it *before* the proposal queue — a refusal
   beside a filed draft would mean the gate ran too late to matter.
2. The gate is SATISFIABLE, not a wall: the same edit carrying citations is admitted. That
   is what proves the refusal was the citation clause rather than "insight items are
   broken".
3. **Vacuity.** No ingestion-vocabulary `item_type` acquires a `kind`, and a plain note's
   update behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was. Without this, "we set kind" could be
   indiscriminate — mirroring `item_type` onto `kind` wholesale would invent a contract the
   taxonomy explicitly denies (`note`/`bookmark` are item_types; `fact` is a kind) — and
   every other assertion here would still pass.
