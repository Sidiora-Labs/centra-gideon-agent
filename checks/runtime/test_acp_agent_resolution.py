"""P1 regression: an acp_agent entry (acp:<cli>) resolves through the registry's
own factory (registry.build).

Caught live originally: with a real acp:claude-code entry registered, chat
resolution fell into a model-provider shim path (_build_llm_provider →
load_factory(shim)) → AttributeError ('_Cfg' has no 'implementation'), because the
shim was a model-type duck-type with no manifest. That divergent shim path has
since been removed entirely — model AND agent-runtime entries now build through the
single registry.build path — so the failure mode can no longer occur. This test
keeps the guarantee: an acp_agent candidate builds via registry.build(name, ...).
