"""`automation verify-migration` — the row-for-row diff (§7 step 2 / §8 — S91).

§7 step 2 names it: "row-for-row cron migration (old file read-only one release; `gideon
automation verify-migration` diff command)". §8 lists it as the mitigation for "Migration trust
(crons are the most-loved automations)".

**🔴 WHAT DRIVING IT AGAINST THE OWNER'S REAL STORE FOUND.** Four jobs migrate `lossless:
true`, and TWO come out disabled — `j-every` (a 5-minute interval) and `j-seq` (an
`agent_sequence`) were `enabled=True` in `crons.json` and land `enabled=False`.

That is not a bug: `migrate.convert_job` pauses any row that produced a note, and its comment is
right ("nothing fires on a schedule the migration could not fully interpret … the opposite
default would run a half-understood automation unattended"). But `lossless: true` beside two
silently-stopped automations is technically accurate and practically misleading, and closing
exactly that gap is why the plan put a diff command in the same breath as the migration.

So `VerifyReport.ok` is FALSE for a paused row while `migrate_crons`' `lossless` is TRUE — the
deliberate difference these tests pin.
