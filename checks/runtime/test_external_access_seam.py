"""The shared inbound access seam (EXTERNAL-ACCESS EA-1, §1 + §10 + §11).

What this file is careful about, because the repo's recurring defect is a control
that exists and never fires:

* **Refusals are asserted as refusals.** "`public_url` is not PATCH-editable" is
  tested by driving the PATCH endpoint and seeing it rejected, not by checking a
  key's absence from a dict — an allowlist can be bypassed by a second write path,
  and only the endpoint knows whether one exists.
* **Every rail has a vacuity floor.** Each `test_*_can_fail` proves its sibling can
  go red, so a rail that silently stopped matching anything is caught here rather
  than in the release that needed it.
* **Boundaries are tested on both sides.** 31 bytes refused AND 32 accepted; a
  binding respected AND a binding violated.
