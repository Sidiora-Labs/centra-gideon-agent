"""EA-5 — the two `/capture/v1` routes must reach their OWN admission gate.

Measured before the fix: neither `/capture/v1/chat/completions` nor `/capture/v1/messages`
was on `_BYPASS_EXACT` or `_BYPASS_PREFIXES`, while `/mcp` was. So the dashboard's
`token_auth` middleware ran first and denied every request carrying no `?token=` query
param and no `pc_token_<port>` cookie — which is exactly the shape an external coding agent
sends: it points `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at the proxy and presents the capture bearer in
`Authorization`, a header the dashboard middleware never reads. Both routes shipped
UNREACHABLE. Nothing was wrong with either half on its own; the defect only exists in the
union, which is why the tests here drive the real middleware and the real handlers together.

Two properties, and the second is the one that makes the first safe:

* the paths bypass the dashboard's cookie auth in every mode `token_auth.py` implements,
  with a vacuity floor beside it (an unrelated path is still denied) so "bypassed" is a
  property of these paths and not of a middleware that stopped denying anything;
* bypassing opens nothing — `capture_proxy._admit` still answers 404 for a disabled
  surface, 403 for a non-loopback peer and 401 for a bad bearer, each asserted *through*
  the middleware rather than trusted from the comment.
