"""The model-root rail proves it fires (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 SC-10, LMMV-7).

``conftest._forbid_real_model_roots`` wraps every ``local_models/layouts.py`` entry point
for the whole suite so a test cannot reach a real model dir / cache root. A rail that only
ever runs against a tree where it should stay silent is indistinguishable from a rail that
never fires, so this file drives it both directions:

* a ``tmp_path`` root passes straight through, unchanged — the rail is not a tax
* every named real root is REFUSED, including via the fixture-installed wrapper, so the
  bound-model-deletion incident (a real delete against ``~/.cache/huggingface``) cannot be
  written again even by a test that means to

The forbidden-root list is asserted non-empty and asserted to contain the specific roots
the incident touched, so shrinking it to nothing is a visible change rather than a silent
one — a rail matching nothing looks clean.
