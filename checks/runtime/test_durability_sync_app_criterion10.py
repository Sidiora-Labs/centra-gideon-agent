"""Criterion 10, end to end: a THIRD-PARTY `type: "sync"` app registers, configures through
the standard provider routes, and syncs — with zero core changes (DURABILITY-AND-SYNC §4.3).

`test_sync_transport_contract.py` already pins the pieces at unit level (the type is in
`PROVIDER_TYPES`, `SyncTypeHandler` registers and deregisters an instance). What it cannot
show is the criterion's actual claim, which is about an app the core has never heard of:

* the transport arrives as an `app.json` + a Python file INSIDE the app's own directory —
  nothing in `src/gideon` names it, so "zero core changes" is a property of the
  fixture rather than an assertion about it;
* its settings are read and written through `/api/providers/{name}/schema` + `/config`, the
  same routes every other provider type uses — no durability-specific config endpoint;
* and then it actually SYNCS: `service.run_sync_job()` resolves it by name and a real cycle
  pushes objects into the store it owns.

The transport here is deliberately dumb (it copies bytes into a directory), because the point
being verified is the seam, not the transport.
