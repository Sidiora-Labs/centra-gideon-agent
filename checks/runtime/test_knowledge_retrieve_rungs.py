"""Every rung of the knowledge-retrieve degradation ladder, FORCED (#1781).

**Why the dead rung shipped.** `_fts` joined a TEXT id against an INTEGER rowid
(`JOIN items i ON i.id = f.rowid`), so it matched no row and answered `[]` for
every query in every store. The tier was documented, named in the payload, and
dead on arrival.

Nothing caught it because nothing ever ran it. In a test environment an embedder
is available, so `hybrid` answers every query — measured, all three of the
existing suite's scenarios report `strategy="hybrid"` — and the one assertion
about tiers was `assert payload["strategy"] in ("hybrid", "fts", "fts_fallback",
"substring_fallback")`, which passes whichever tier answered, including a broken
one. A set-membership assertion over every possible answer cannot fail.

**So each rung here is forced into service and then required to RETURN
SOMETHING.** A tier that names itself while returning nothing is the defect, so
"the strategy string is right" is never the whole assertion: `items` must be
non-empty for a term the item provably contains.

**And the join was only half of it.** FTS5 parses its query as an EXPRESSION, so
fixing the join alone leaves the rung dead for anything but a single bare word.
Measured with the join corrected and the query still raw:

    "latency"    -> 1 hit
    "cold-start" -> OperationalError: no such column: start
    'latency"'   -> OperationalError: unterminated string
    "AND"        -> OperationalError: fts5: syntax error near "AND"

all four swallowed to `[]` by the `except Exception`. A hyphen was enough. That
is why `test_a_join_only_fix_would_not_have_been_enough` exists: it is the test
a join-only patch fails.
