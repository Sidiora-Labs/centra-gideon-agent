"""MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY §1.5 / MRT-1d — the telemetry read-model + route.

Per-model efficiency rows derived on request from the routing fold (routing_stats.json) + a
bounded model_calls.jsonl tail: fold supplies n/success/feedback/cost, the tail supplies read-time
p50/p95, and each row carries on_frontier (not dominated on quality/latency/cost). Read-only.

Plus the one WRITE this handler owns — ``PUT /api/models/routing-policy``'s ``order`` lever
(§6.2 lever 3). See :class:`TestRoutingPolicyWrite` for why those rails read the table back off
disk instead of watching for a call.
