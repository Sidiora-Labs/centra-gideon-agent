"""Tests for the task projection core (TASKS-SOPS §1, S55). A materialized Task is a VIEW of a
node, not a second copy of the truth. Three properties follow, and each was measured rather
than assumed: **The projection table must be exhaustive.** An earlier version covered nine of
the engine's fourteen `InstanceState` members, and the five it missed all fell through to
`OPEN` — so a tripped circuit breaker, a scope violation and a protocol-violation block each
read on the board as ordinary work still to do. The gaps were filled from the engine's OWN
`SUCCESS_STATES`/`TERMINAL_STATES`, and a test here asserts both exhaustiveness and agreement
with those sets. **A new model field is dropped unless the provider names it.**
`NativeTaskProvider.create_task` builds its Task field-by-field, so the binding round-tripped
through `to_dict`/`from_dict` and still arrived empty from `create_task`. **`from_dict`
silently coerced an unknown status to OPEN.** Before `SKIPPED` existed, a task written with
`status: "skipped"` read back as work still to do — silently, on the board the user plans
from.
