"""Rails for the computer-use DISPATCH — the composition `DCU-2`'s screens were waiting for.

`DCU-2` shipped ``policy.check_app``, ``policy.check_input_target`` and
``gate.require_computer_use`` as three correct, tested functions with **zero production
callers** (its own audit censused them; ``test_computer_use_call_sites.py`` is the marker it
left behind). `DCU-4` is the caller. So the question this file has to answer is not "do the
screens work" — the sibling suites already drive them directly — but the four things only a
composition can get wrong:

1. **Order.** A screen that runs after the button has been pressed is not a screen. So
   :func:`test_the_chain_runs_every_screen_before_the_acting_driver_call` records the ACTUAL
   sequence of collaborator calls at runtime and asserts it, and
   :func:`test_the_ordering_rail_detects_a_screen_moved_after_the_action` proves that recording
   can fail — run against a deliberately mis-ordered chain, it flags it.
2. **The refusal reaches the caller through the dispatch**, not by a test calling a screen
   directly. Every refusal case here goes in at :func:`service.computer_dispatch`.
3. **The SEL row on the ALLOWED path, asserted separately from the refused one.** The `DCU-2`
   audit's sharpest finding: a test asserting "a SEL record exists" passes when only the
   refusal writes one. Two tests, and both drive a REAL
   :class:`~gideon.sel.SecurityEventLog` at a tmp ``base_dir`` — the sibling gate suite
   substitutes a capturing fake, which proves ``log()`` was *called*, not that the row is
   writable.
4. **The bounds hold from both sides.** A TTL that refuses *at* its documented value, or an
   index bound that admits one past the end, are both silent correctness bugs. Each is tested
   at the boundary and one step past it, and each has a floor proving the test can fail.

**No test in this file touches the real home.** The keystone path is redirected by env var
(``enable_state.ENABLE_PATH_ENV``), the SEL is constructed at ``tmp_path``, and the snapshot
store is process-local and reset per test.
