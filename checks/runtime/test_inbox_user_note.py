"""A user-authored note reaches the inbox (INU-9).

Every inbox source that shipped before this was **synthesized**: a notification rule fired, a
run needed input, a poll found a message, an app contributed a proposal. There was no way for
a person to put something in their own inbox — which is why the desktop tray's "Quick Capture
Note…" row (DC-4) deep-linked ``#/inbox?capture=1`` and wrote nothing. `apps/console/src` had zero
readers for that flag; the router parsed it and dropped it.

So these tests refuse to stop at the dataclass. Each one drives the REAL path — ``POST
/api/inbox/notes`` → :func:`gideon.integrations.inbox.emit_attention_item` → the persisted row
re-read **off disk** → ``GET /api/inbox`` — because the two failure modes worth catching are
both invisible to a unit test on the model:

* an item that exists only in the service's memory (the store holds items in RAM and never
  re-reads its file, so a writer that skipped ``flush()`` would pass any in-process
  assertion and lose the user's note at the next restart), and
* a notification target the rules vocabulary advertises but cannot deliver — the phantom-source
  failure two sibling atoms spent a week untangling. Here the check is direct: the pair is
  registered, its wire string round-trips, it renders as a row in the rules matrix, AND
  ``state.notify`` is observed carrying that wire string.
