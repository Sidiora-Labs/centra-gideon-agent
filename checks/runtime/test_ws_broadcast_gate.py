"""One WebSocket producer, one permission gate — and an unmapped note never reaches a client.

`broadcast_ws` enforces per-app `permissions.events`: an app-scoped socket receives an event only
if the app's manifest declared it. `_broadcast` — the always-on dashboard translator (sessions,
titles, refresh hints, chat messages, notifications) — ended in `self._send_ws_all(...)`, which
writes to every socket directly. So the gate sat immediately below a second producer that skipped
it, and app-scoped sockets received every always-on frame regardless of what the app declared.

Its `else:` branch was the second half of the defect: any unrecognized `_type` was shipped as
`{"type": "notification", "data": <the raw internal note>}`, so a typo'd or retired type reached
every client as an untyped blob the frontend renders as a toast.

Both are asserted here **at the socket**, by reading what a fake app-scoped WS actually received —
not by inspecting the producer. And the vacuity case is the one that matters: a DECLARED event must
still arrive, or "filter everything" would pass every test above it.
