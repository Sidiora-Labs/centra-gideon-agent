"""`G4` — a slash command an agent cannot run must ANSWER, not hard-error the turn.

The measured defect (ACP-AGENT-PARITY `O23`): the dashboard sent
``_vendor.dev/commands/execute`` for any ``/word`` message with no capability check at all.
claude-code adapter 0.60.0 does not implement that method, answered JSON-RPC ``-32601``,
and the turn died with ``Prompt error: {'code': -32601, …}`` — the plain-prompt fallback the
audit assumed *did not exist*.

The contract these tests pin, one file because it is one decision:

* the flag is READ off the ``initialize`` handshake (same shape as ``loadSession``), and it
  is an allowlist — silence means "do not send";
* an unadvertised command produces NO wire frame, so nothing can fail;
* ``-32601`` is TYPED, so only "this agent cannot" can trigger a substitution — every other
  JSON-RPC error still surfaces;
* the substitution runs only while the turn has produced NOTHING. After output it is
  refused, because re-issuing would duplicate the answer and bill the turn twice;
* and the substitution is SAID OUT LOUD — a user who typed ``/compact`` and silently got a
  plain-prompt answer was handed a different thing than they asked for.
