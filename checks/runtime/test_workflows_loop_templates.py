"""Integration tests for the loop-kind bundled templates.

These templates are the descendants of the five loop kinds, and the property that
matters most is the one the plan calls the platform's oldest rule: **no agent certifies
its own work**. A template whose work stage self-reports `done: true` with no judge
behind it has that rule broken at the spec level, where no runtime check can help.

So the tests here are mostly structural invariants over the shipped specs rather than
behavioural tests of the engine — the engine has its own suites. What cannot be caught
at runtime is a template that was authored wrong.
