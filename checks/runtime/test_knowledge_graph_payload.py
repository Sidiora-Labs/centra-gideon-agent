"""KL-17 -- GET /api/knowledge/graph: every node ships, EDGES are thinned.

What changed, and why these tests exist: the endpoint used to answer a library of any size
with ``sorted(nodes, key=degree)[:limit]`` -- at most 200 entities, default 100. That is
data loss with nothing in the response saying so: the 2,800 entities of a 3,000-entity
library were not collapsed or summarised, they were simply absent, and a user navigating
the graph could not tell the difference between "this entity has no relations" and "this
entity was not in the top 200 by degree".

KL-17 replaces the node cap with edge thinning -- a weight floor plus a top-K-PER-NODE keep
-- so the payload stays bounded while every node survives. The tests below pin the four
properties that make that a real replacement rather than a rename:

* every node ships, including ones the old degree sort would have dropped;
* the top-K is per-node, so a hub cannot eat a global budget and leave the periphery
  edgeless (the node cap wearing a different hat);
* positions and cluster labels are deterministic -- an unstable layout or an unstable label
  teaches the user nothing, which is the whole point of computing them server-side;
* the memo really memoizes, and its invalidation really is debounced.

Every negative assertion here carries a vacuity guard and a positive control seeded in the
same test, so an empty graph, a broken fixture or a spy that never counts cannot make an
exclusion assertion pass trivially.

``project_2d`` (KL-17a) is substituted through the handler's ``_load_project_2d`` seam by a
spy that places an item at its first two vector components. That makes centroids exactly
predictable AND makes "the memo did not recompute" an assertion about a call count rather
than about elapsed time. The real function's contract -- a point for every input id, in
input order, normalized, off-basis vectors at the origin -- is what the handler codes
against; the spy honours it.
