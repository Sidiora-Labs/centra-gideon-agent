"""EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE ES-4 — the judge benchmark harness → tier-recommendation table.

Every test here runs with a STUB judge. No model is called, which is the point: a
benchmark that needed a live provider could not be regression-tested at all, and the
properties worth protecting are arithmetic, not model behaviour.

The load-bearing group is "the axes are consumed". A declared matrix axis that nothing
reads produces N identical runs wearing different labels — a fabricated comparison that
looks real in every artifact — so `judge_samples` and `tier` each have a test that fails
if the executor stops honouring them. What is NOT exercised here is stated plainly in the
module docstring of `evals/judge_bench.py`: whether a REAL model at a given tier clears
the floors is a live-provider question, and only the shape of the answer is tested.
