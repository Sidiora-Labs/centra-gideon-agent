"""PL-9 — the API version is a negotiated contract, not an emitted number.

Before this atom ``API_VERSION`` was write-only: defined in ``manifest.py`` and
emitted into ``/api/manifest`` plus two generated reference docs, with no
comparison anywhere. These tests are the comparison, driven through the real
