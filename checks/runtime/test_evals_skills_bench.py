"""EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE ES-7 §3.3 — the skills/templates impact bench.

The clause is "replays consulted runs with a skill surfaced-vs-suppressed", and it has two
easy-to-fake halves:

* **The population.** "Consulted" is the WF2-R13 ledger event, so the bench must read that
  event — not a proxy. ``test_consulted_runs_reads_the_wf2_r13_ledger_event`` writes real
  events through the real emitter (``Journal.consulted``) and asserts the reader finds them.
* **The suppression.** A suppressed arm whose prompt still carries the skill body measures
  nothing. The negative ("the body is absent") is trivially satisfied by an empty prompt, so
  every assertion of it here is PAIRED with the positive ("the body is present in the
  surfaced arm") — that pairing is the vacuity floor, and
  ``test_an_absent_skill_does_not_count_as_verified_suppression`` proves the pair reds when
  only the negative holds.
