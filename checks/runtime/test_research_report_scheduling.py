"""A due research report actually fires, and `is_due` finally has a production caller.

WF2KNO-12 shipped a report definition store, a runner, an API, a UI, a `research-finding`
kind and a delivery path — and nothing attached the schedule to anything. Measured then and
recorded as the atom's UNMET clause: `grep -rn 'is_due' src/` found no caller of
`research_reports.is_due` outside its own module. A report could be defined, run by hand,
refused, listed and delivered; a *due* report never fired.

The fix is a `clock` trigger row per report, whose action is the provider that already
exists — deliberately NOT a second sweeper loop, because `gateway.py`'s `_clock_loop` is
explicit that a clock fire and a file fire go through ONE dispatch path "rather than two
that drift", and a second loop would re-decide arming, overlap, catch-up and audit slightly
differently.

Two seams here would each have produced a row that looks scheduled and never fires, and
neither is visible from the definition side:

* **The frozen-capability fence.** `screen.EMPTY_MEANS = "deny"` — "a trigger that declared
  nothing gets nothing" — and `knowledge-report` is classified write-capable. A row with no
  `capabilities` block is refused at fire time.
* **Arming.** A freshly upserted clock row carries `next_fire_at = ""`, which `arm.py`'s own
  docstring calls "permanently inert … due_ids STILL []". `boot_migrate.arm_unarmed` runs at
  BOOT only, so a report created while the gateway is up would have waited for a restart —
  the same never-fires defect, moved one step later.

Both are asserted below against the shipped functions rather than against a restatement of
what they should return.
