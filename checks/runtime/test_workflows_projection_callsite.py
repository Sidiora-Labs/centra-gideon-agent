"""The engine CALL SITE for task projection (TASKS-SOPS §1 — S61f).

S55 built `materialize` as pure decision functions and S61e gave the events somewhere to go. Nothing
invoked either during a real run — `grep` for `materialize.` outside its own module found zero hits,
so every rule in it was reachable only from a test.

This session wires it into `RunController` where a node settles, and these tests drive REAL runs to
completion rather than calling the hook directly: a call site that is never reached is exactly the
defect being fixed, and only an executed run proves it fires.

Two mismatches were measured while wiring it, both of which would have made the projection silently
project NOTHING:

* `should_materialize`/`plan_materialization` read the node keys **`id`**, `kind`, `path` and
  `config`. A `node_id` key — the name the *binding* uses — is ignored by both, so every node would
  have failed the has-an-id refusal.
* `plan.create` holds **`TaskSpec`** objects, not dicts. `entry.get("task_id")` would have raised
  inside the hook's own `except`, which swallows — so the projection would have failed invisibly on
  every single node.
