"""Project archive I/O — the round trip that proves the export planner exports something (S54, C9).

`project_export` was a complete planning layer with ZERO importers: the exclusion policy, the
digests and the path-safety predicate were all written and unused. So the tests that mattered here
are the ones a plan-only test cannot answer — does a ZIP get written, does it extract on a CLEAN
home, do the entities survive byte-identical, and are the secrets genuinely absent from the BYTES
rather than merely absent from the plan.

The zero-secrets assertions read `secret_basenames()`/`excluded()` rather than restating a list.
A second hand-maintained list of credential names is the drift that let stores escape coverage
before; a test carrying its own copy would pass while the policy it claims to check moved.
