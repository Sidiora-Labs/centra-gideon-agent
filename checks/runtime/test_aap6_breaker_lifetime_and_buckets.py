"""ACP-AGENT-PARITY §2.3 gap 5 (atom ``AAP-6``) — the two reasons clause 2 could not close.

The prior tick left clause 2 (*"a deliberately failing-tool ACP session trips the circuit
and aborts the turn with the standard breaker message"*) met on kiro and codex and blocked
on claude-code, with two findings recorded rather than fixed:

* **``G154`` (HIGH) — the bucket fragmented.** claude-code sends ``description`` on every
  Bash call, and a model enumerating its own retries writes "Run boom command (1 of 4)" …
  "(4 of 4)". Four byte-identical commands therefore produced four streaks of one and no
  rung fired. Deliberately NOT fixed by stripping ``description`` outright, because for a
  tool whose payload IS a description that merges genuinely different calls and the breaker
  starts aborting healthy turns. Fixed here by dropping annotation keys **only when a
  behavioural key survives beside them** — the narrow reading the finding asked for.
* **``G155`` (MEDIUM) — the circuit rung was unreachable by construction.** ``_acp_breaker``
  was a local in ``_run_chat``, i.e. per TURN, while ``CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD = 30`` is defined by
  ``LoopBreaker`` itself as "this **run's** total failures". An unattended loop repeating a
  failing tool for twenty turns reset the counter every turn and never tripped. Recorded as
  an E3 (the lifetime is a design decision, not an implementation detail). Owner ruling: the
  host-side analogue of a native run is the SESSION, so the breaker lives there.

Both fixes are measured on identity and counting rather than on wording, so a later change
to the notice text cannot make these vacuous.
