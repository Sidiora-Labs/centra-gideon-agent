"""WS-7's missing half: the morning digest's CALLER (WATCHED-SOURCES §6.2).

`tests/test_watched_sources_digest.py` proves `run_morning_digest` works when something calls
it. WS-7's execution log records that nothing did: *"the digest is invocable and fully tested,
but nothing in the shipped product calls it yet"*. Measured on `main` at `0169f8d4`: `git grep
run_morning_digest -- src/` returned TWO hits, both inside `source_digest.py` (the definition
and a docstring mention). Zero callers.

So this file asserts REACHABILITY, not existence — a registered-but-never-fired trigger is the
same defect one level up:

* the reconciler puts an ARMED `clock` row in the unified `TriggerStore` the clock loop reads;
* the provider name in THAT ROW resolves through the real action-provider registry and passes
  the scheduler's own `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` validation, so the fire is not refused;
* dispatching from the stored row exactly as `gateway._fire_store_trigger` does actually
  produces ONE knowledge item and ONE notification through the shipped
  `notification_allowed()` gate;
* `mute_all` still suppresses it (the gate is not re-implemented or bypassed);
* a SECOND fire posts nothing, which is what `digest_cursor.json` is for;
* and `_init_cron` — the boot path — really contains the call.

No frozen clock anywhere. WS-7 recorded a measured false green from one: `_due_delay` compares
against the store's wall-clock `last_poll_at`, so a clock pinned at `t=1_000_000` leaves every
source permanently "not due" and every later `tick()` a silent no-op that reads as success. The
ingest here does ONE tick against a source that has never been polled (so it is due on the real
clock, with no waiting), and the double-fire test re-dispatches the DIGEST rather than re-polling
the source — so no due-check is involved and no sleep is needed.
