"""Tool risk taxonomy — the effective-risk resolver + name-based inference
(docs/plans/ports/tool-risk-taxonomy.md).

`risk_level` is a gradient (safe/caution/destructive) over the old binary approval
flag. Two pure functions carry the contract the approval gate + UI depend on:

- ``resolve_effective_risk`` — the PER-INVOCATION risk of one call (a DESTRUCTIVE
  ``bash`` tool running ``cat`` is effectively safe; an unclassified external tool
  floors at caution so trust-reads can't silently auto-approve it).
- ``infer_risk_from_name`` — the DECLARED risk for a tool that ships none (dict-defined
  MCP tools + external MCP), classified by name verb.

These are security-relevant (trust-reads auto-approves EFFECTIVE-SAFE), so the
classification is pinned here against regression.
