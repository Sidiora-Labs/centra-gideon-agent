"""``gideon.sdk.documents`` — the document-generation seam on the app boundary.

An app that fronts document generation (a brief-to-deck app, a report exporter) has to
reach the writers core ships, or it vendors python-pptx/python-docx and becomes a second
renderer that drifts from the parsers Knowledge reads those formats back with. The facade
is what makes the first option available, so this suite pins the three properties an app
front depends on:

* every promoted name resolves, and resolves to the SAME object core uses (a facade that
  re-implements is a second implementation wearing a re-export's clothes);
* ``register_writer`` is deliberately NOT promoted — an app-registered format would be
  visible to every other caller of the shared registry while that app is enabled and gone
  when it is disabled, so ``available_formats()`` would stop being a property of the build;
* the markdown → model → bytes path an app actually walks produces a file the matching
  core parser reads back, which is the only definition of "openable" worth asserting.
