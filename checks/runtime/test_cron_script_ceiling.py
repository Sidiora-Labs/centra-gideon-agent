"""A scheduled script runs under the ``tool`` resource ceiling (EXECUTION-ISOLATION EI-3).

``run_script_sandboxed`` already had the OS path sandbox (``wrap_argv``) and, since PHF-4,
an allowlisted child environment. Neither is a resource ceiling: before EI-3 a cron script
could exhaust the gateway's file descriptors or fork-bomb in ways an agent bash command —
which has carried the ``tool`` ceiling since PHF-1 — already could not.

These tests **drive a real cron script** through the real spawn path rather than inspecting a
constructed argv, because the failure mode being guarded against is a ceiling that composes
wrongly with the sandbox wrap and so never reaches the child at all. The script reports its
own ``resource.getrlimit`` and its own ``OSError``, so every number here is the child's view.

Platform honesty: on macOS only **RLIMIT_NOFILE** is enforced. ``RLIMIT_NPROC`` (fork bound)
and ``RLIMIT_AS`` (address space) ship OFF by default — ``NPROC`` is a *per-user* cap that
would break a busy host, and the durable pids/memory bound is PHF-2's Linux cgroup tier, not
an rlimit. ``oom_score_adj`` is Linux-only and silently skipped here. So NOFILE is what is
driven below, and it is the only ceiling this seam enforces on this platform.

Second platform note: on macOS >= 26 ``sandbox-exec`` is refused for third-party callers, so
``detect_backend`` returns ``none`` and the OS wrap is a pass-through. The composition of the
ceiling with a real *exec wrapper* is therefore driven through a surrogate of the same shape
(see the last test) rather than left unexercised.
