"""SV-9 — the Self-QA Companion core, one test class per clause of the atom's `done_when`.

The four clauses are checked independently, and each one carries a vacuity floor — a mutation
that would make it red — because every mechanism here is one whose failure mode is *looking
fine*. A watcher that never fires files nothing; a triage that never runs files nothing; a
filing step that files three times still files at least one. "No findings appeared" is the
expected output of a healthy run AND of a completely dead loop, so nothing in this file asserts
an absence without also asserting the positive record that distinguishes the two.

Every test drives a REAL temporary git repository, the REAL installed cron script (imported from
the file the installer wrote, not a parallel copy), the REAL run ledger, and the REAL native
inbox/task sinks. The session-wide `_isolate_real_home_writers` fixture in `conftest.py` redirects
`config_dir()` to a tmp dir, so the ledger and task writes here cannot reach `~/.gideon`;
the crons dir is additionally passed explicitly.

    """Success Criterion #6 reads: a test-only commit produces "a ledger-only skip record with a
    one-line rationale **(visible in the runs surface, no full run spent)**".

    SV-9 shipped the write and recorded that this parenthetical was unmet. Two independent breaks
    stood between a written row and a legible one, and each looked exactly like working code:

    1. **The row was stamped with the node id, not the engine's instance key.** `record_triage`
       wrote `instance_path="triage"`, while the engine names that instance `root.children[0]`
       (`models.walk`). `service.inspect_node` builds a node's ledger slice by filtering the run's
       ledger on `instance_path == <target>`, so every triage row fell outside its own node's
       slice — written, readable through the ledger reader, and unreachable from the runs surface.
       Fixed by threading the instance path into the action payload (the engine is the only layer
       that knows it) and refusing an absent one, the way an absent rationale is already refused.
    2. **The surface rendered a row's `kind` and nothing else** — pinned in
       `web/src/pages/workflows/NodeInspectorDrawer.test.tsx`, on rendered DOM.

    The interesting property is SEVERAL rows under ONE node id: the companion writes one per
    commit, so a surface (or a slice) that kept only the latest would lose skips while still
    looking populated. Every test here uses THREE commits for that reason — one row cannot see it.

class TestClauseThreeScenarioDrivesTheUI:
    """`a user-impacting commit generates a scenario that mutates state through the real UI via
    Chrome DevTools MCP`.

    **What is asserted here is the template contract, not a UI drive.** Executing this clause
    end-to-end needs a reachable Chrome DevTools MCP server and a running gateway built from the
    commit under test. Both were obtained on 2026-08-24 and the clause STILL does not close — the
    two things in the way are recorded here so the next session does not re-derive them:

    1. **FIXED.** `route` could select neither of its own cases, because the engine keyed a
       boolean selector as `str(True)` → `"True"` and a JSON template can only spell the case
       `true`. So the entire scenario subtree was unreachable from a real run while the
       declarative assertion below passed. `test_the_ENGINE_selects_that_case_...` is the rail
       that would have caught it, and now does.
    2. **NOT this atom's, and NOT fixed here.** A `stage` node's spawn completion has no
       consumer: `dispatch_stage` returns RUNNING carrying `{"subagent_id": ...}` and nothing in
       the repo reads that key, while `_apply` pops the instance out of `_inflight` — so neither
       the stall clock nor the total timeout can see it either. Measured: `scenario-gen`'s
       subagent reported `done: True, error: ""` and the node was still RUNNING with no
       `step_completed` fifteen minutes later. That is the engine's stage seam, not the
       companion's, and it blocks every template with a stage node.

    What these tests do enforce is every property of the shipped template that the clause depends
    on — the routing (now through the real dispatcher), the MCP binding, the state-mutation
    requirement, and the engine-enforced proof gate.

    The MCP half of the clause IS satisfied and was measured separately: with `chrome-devtools`
    in `$GIDEON_HOME/mcp.json` and the `mcp-tools` app installed, the running gateway's
    `/api/tools` lists all 29 `mcp/chrome-devtools/*` tools, so a stage subagent can drive the
    browser. Nothing declares or checks that dependency, which is its own gap — the template
    declares `git`/`ffmpeg` under `metadata.requirements.binaries` and preflight has no
    equivalent for an MCP server.
