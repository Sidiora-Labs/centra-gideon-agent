"""EI-7 — the ``second-opinion`` action provider is wired at all four points it needs.

§4.1 states the failure this guards: "a new action provider that skips this is rejected by hook
create/update even though the UI offers it". A provider registered in one set and missing from
another validates, saves, and then fails at fire time — strictly worse than not offering it. So
the four points are asserted together:

1. the dispatch registry (``action_providers.registry``) resolves the name;
2. ``validation.ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`` accepts it, so a trigger can be created;
3. ``guardrails.rungs`` carries an autonomy declaration for it (a registered provider with no
   declaration is indistinguishable from an ungoverned action at the dispatch seams); and
4. ``triggers.screen`` classifies it write-capable, so an unattended fire needs the opt-in.

Each assertion carries a vacuity floor: the same lookup against a name that does NOT exist must
fail. Otherwise a membership test against a set that answers "yes" to everything would pass.
