"""Tests for persist-time conflict detection, the Session Brief, and the fencing filter.

The recurring hazard in all three is a control that is present and inert: a conflict pass that
finds nothing looks identical to a store with no conflicts; a brief that dropped half its items
looks identical to a project with half as much knowledge; a fence that failed to neutralize a
close marker looks identical to one that worked. So each test here asserts an EFFECT.
