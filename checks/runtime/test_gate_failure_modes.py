"""The per-gate fail-open/fail-closed classification, verified against real behaviour (S130).

§1.4 decision 1 (R3 am.): *"Fail-open vs fail-closed is classified **per gate**: budget/storm-guard
checks time-box and fail-open; security fences (capabilities, injection screen, fencing) stay
fail-closed."*

🔴 THE DEFECT. The classification existed as data (`FAIL_OPEN_GATES` + `gate_failure_mode`) and was
read by **no production code** — only tests. Measured:

    set(firepath.GATE_ORDER) & FAIL_OPEN_GATES  ==  set()

Two vocabularies that never intersected. The set held per-trigger CAP KEYS a person edits
(`cost_cap`, `rate_cap`, `duty_gate` — the `GATE_KEYS` vocabulary), while the fire path walks GATE
names (`screen`, `quiet`, `duty`, `budget`, `claim`, `yield`, `capability`, `incident`). So **every
gate the engine actually runs resolved to "closed"** — including `duty`, which §1.4 and
`calendar.evaluate_duty` both require to fail OPEN.

**The gates were right; the classifier was wrong.** Driven: an unregistered duty provider allows the
fire ("duty gate 'no-such-calendar-app' is not registered; the fire proceeds"), and an unreadable
budget refuses it. The table describing that behaviour disagreed with it in both directions, and
nothing outside tests read the table, so nothing caught the drift.

These tests therefore assert the classification against **what the gates do**, not against the table
itself. A test that only compared the table to a hardcoded list would have passed before the fix.
