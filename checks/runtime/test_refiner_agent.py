"""WF2LEA-6 — the template-refiner agent is propose-only, and its tools file, never apply.

Two enforcement layers must BOTH hold and are both asserted here: (1) the refiner's tool set
contains no write or orchestration tool, checked against the SAME classifiers the workflow leaf
posture enforces (`batch_compile.is_write_tool` + `ORCHESTRATION_TOOLS`), so adding a direct
template-write tool reds this; (2) a research-class leaf — which is what the `refine-template`
stage runs as — denies every write tool (and `workflow_author`) at the handler while admitting
the refiner's read/propose tools. And the propose tool FILES a proposal and mutates no template.
