"""Tests for the risk registry, autonomy floors and the confirmation matrix (UP-R4/R6, S44).

The scanner is measured against the SHIPPED library, not fixtures, because its most damaging failure
mode is the false positive: a risk scanner that fires on a template doing its job gets suppressed
wholesale, and the real findings go with it. Three false positives were found that way and are
encoded below as regression tests.

The other property under test is asymmetry. Every control here fails in a chosen direction — a
destructive action is never auto-approved in any mode, an unattended run still stops at HITL nodes,
and a single failed run RESETS earned trust rather than averaging it away.
