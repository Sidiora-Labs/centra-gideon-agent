"""S79 — criterion 4's adversarial test for the REFINER path (§3.1 TRUST / §7.4).

The criterion, verbatim: "Content inside `fence_untrusted` provably never becomes a
lesson/skill/template — and the adversarial test covers the REFINER path: injection planted in a run
transcript or `run_feedback` comment must not surface as a proposal (let alone an accepted diff)."

**Measured before writing.** The refiner path had NO screen and NO fence: grepped `refiner.py` for
`screen(`, `fence_untrusted` and `triggers.screen` — none present. With an injection planted in
a `step_failed` error, the text flowed straight into the cluster SIGNATURE, which is exactly what a
refiner prompt carries as its evidence. §3.1's TRUST clause makes fencing the caller's
responsibility
and names the refiner as "the 5th" call site; it had not been built.

The suite is an attack corpus rather than examples, and it asserts the property at BOTH layers the
criterion names: the payload must not reach a cluster (so it cannot choose the target), and must
not reach a prompt.
