"""The declared headroom contract at the assembly seam (CONTEXT-ECONOMY CE2-8).

A turn must stop discovering the context limit by failing at it. What that means, and what
each test here holds:

* **Three DECLARED states, not an exception.** The set is closed and callers branch on a
  value.
* **The output reserve is part of the bound.** A prompt that fills the window EXACTLY
  leaves no room to answer and must not read as ``fits``. The reserve is
  ``local_models.budgets.output_budget``'s number — asserted by parity, so a second
  output-budget notion cannot be minted quietly.
* **The window came from the registry, not a hardcoded default.** ``model_context_window``
  answers every query with 200k for a model it has never heard of; adopting that would be
  the defaulted-field-is-an-unsupplied-input defect and would leave the whole contract
  measured against a number nobody declared. Unknown is ``None``, never 200k, never 0.
* **The user is told when compression runs**, naming what was compressed.
* **Pressure is observable BEFORE the failure**, while the state is still ``fits``.
* **A driven assembly** past a small CATALOG-declared window produces a legible refusal
  that names the specific oversized component.
