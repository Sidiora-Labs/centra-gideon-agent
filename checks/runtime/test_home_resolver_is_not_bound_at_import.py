"""A lazily-imported module must not bind a home resolver at import (#2443, #2442).

Both of those issues were the same defect, reached from different directions.

`tasks/native.py` did `from gideon.config.loader import config_dir` at module level, and
`registry._ensure_native()` imports that module LAZILY — on first use. Under test, first use can
land inside a test that has patched `loader.config_dir` to return its own tmp home, so the module
captures THAT LAMBDA. `monkeypatch` then restores the attribute on `loader` at teardown, but
nothing can restore a copy another module already took, so every later test in the process resolves
the FIRST test's home.

Measured, in the failing pair (trace of the real resolver):

    GET id=t-201ca58d
        path = .../test_withheld_granted_the0/home/tasks/...   <- the FIRST test's home
        env  = .../test_a_provider_that_refuses_l0/home        <- the current test's home

**The env var does not save you**, which is what made this hard to find: `GIDEON_HOME` is
read by the REAL `config_dir`, and the captured lambda never consults it. So the second test filed
its task into a directory it never looks at, which surfaced as two unrelated-looking assertions:
`assert 0 == 1` (its own tasks dir is empty) and `assert 200 == 400` (its unlink loop found nothing,
so the undo it expected to refuse succeeded).

`agent_metadata.py` was the same shape (#2442), lazily imported from `agents/runners.py`.

## What this rail does, and what it does not

The hazard needs BOTH halves: an import-time binding AND a lazy import of that module. Scanning for
the intersection found **59** modules, so this is systemic and latent rather than two accidents —
the two above are simply the two that were reached in an order that bit.

Fixing 59 modules is not this change. So this is a **ratchet**: the intersection must stay a subset
of the baseline recorded below. A NEW module joining it reds by name; every module fixed should be
deleted from the baseline, which can only shrink. It does not claim the baseline is safe — each
entry is a latent instance of a defect that has now cost two issues.
