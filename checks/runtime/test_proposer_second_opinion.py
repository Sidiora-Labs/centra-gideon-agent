"""EI-7 (EXECUTION-ISOLATION §4.1/§4.2) — the second-opinion handoff's two safety properties.

Success criterion 6 has three clauses that can each be faked, so each is asserted at its CALL
SITE with a vacuity floor:

1. **"a DIFFERENT cataloged runner"** — not "some runner ran". The assertion is that the runner
   that stalled is *unreachable*: when it is the ONLY healthy runner in the catalog, selection
   returns nothing and the service degrades to the ``subagent`` backend. A test that only checked
   "a runner was chosen" would pass against a selector with no exclusion at all, so the vacuity
   floor is that the same catalog with a DIFFERENT exclusion does yield that runner — proving the
   catalog was populated and the filter, not an empty universe, is what dropped it.

2. **"accepted only when the disk re-diff confirms the edits"** — asserted as the NEGATIVE. A
   proposer that claims an edit it did not make is REJECTED. The vacuity floor is the paired
   positive: the same proposer, same claim, with the bytes actually written, is accepted. One
   without the other proves nothing (an always-reject gate passes the negative alone).

3. **"SEL-audited"** — a row is read back out of the log, not merely "the code path exists".

Every filesystem touch is under ``tmp_path``; the runner catalog's sidecar reads/writes are
redirected with ``GIDEON_HOME`` (the safe lever — ``monkeypatch.setattr`` on
``config.loader.config_dir`` misses import-bound stores and is not undoable once a consumer has
imported), and the redirect is asserted to have bound before anything depends on it.
