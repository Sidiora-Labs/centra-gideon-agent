"""The rail for the task write-path coercion class (#387, #386, #388, #818).

**The class.** A task field was coerced in some places and not others, in BOTH the read and the
write path, and the inconsistency was the bug rather than any single missing check. Three
different places enumerated the fields — ``Task.from_dict``, ``NativeTaskProvider.create_task``
and ``update_task`` — and they disagreed:

* ``from_dict`` coerced ``order`` with ``float()`` and ``preview`` with ``str()``, and took
  ``title``, ``description`` and ``labels`` verbatim;
* ``create_task`` had its own per-field rules, and its own comment recording that a new model
  field is silently dropped on create unless someone remembers to name it;
* ``update_task`` had typed branches for three fields and, for everything else, a catch-all
  ``setattr(task, key, val)`` behind a ``hasattr`` check — no type check at all, and
  ``__post_init__``'s normalization only ever runs at construction, so an update was the one
  write that never re-validated.

What that accepted, each its own report and each reproduced before this suite was written:

===================================  ===============================================================
``PUT {"order": "abc"}``             200, then every read raised inside a bare ``except`` — the task
                                     answered 404 on GET/DELETE/list while its file stayed on disk
                                     holding its id (#387)
``labels: "not-an-array"``           persisted bare through BOTH create and update;
                                     ``labels.slice(...).map`` took the whole Tasks page into an
                                     error boundary (#386)
``PUT {"description": 12345}``       ``(12345).lower()`` in the search scorer, so
                                     ``POST /api/tasks/search`` answered 500 for EVERY query, not
                                     only ones that would match the poisoned task (#388)
``PUT {"exit_criteria": "via put"}`` iterated the string CHARACTER BY CHARACTER — one un-meetable
                                     criterion per letter, so the task could never be completed
                                     (#818)
===================================  ===============================================================

**What this suite guards.**

1. The table is EXHAUSTIVE over ``Task``'s fields. This is what makes the fix extensible rather
   than a sweep: a field added to ``Task`` without a coercer reds here instead of becoming the
   next field nobody coerced.
2. Read salvages, write refuses — and both go through the same table, because two functions
   would drift.
3. Each reported value is refused or normalized at BOTH ends, create and update, so the
   asymmetry that let one path accept what the other rejected cannot come back.
