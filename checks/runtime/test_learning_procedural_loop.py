"""WF2LEA-13: the procedural-memory loop, driven end to end.

M5d shipped half a loop. `MemoryService.record_procedural` had TWO live writers
(`after_turn_review.record_procedural_outcomes` off the dashboard turn path and
`learning/run_end.py` off a workflow's terminal failures) and
`MemoryService.procedural_priors()` had **zero production callers** — a repo-wide grep
returned the definition plus two tests. Every turn paid to capture how-to-work priors
that nothing ever read. `record_procedural`'s contract also declared four outcomes
where only two were ever written.

This suite pins the closed loop, and it drives the WHOLE chain rather than the reader
alone (a reader that renders nothing in practice is the same defect in a new place):

    record_procedural_outcomes   (live writer, dashboard turn path)
      → promote_by_heat          (live promoter, history consolidation tick)
      → procedural_priors        (the surfaceable set)
      → procedural_block         (the ambient block)
      → build_session_context    (the real prompt assembly)

Plus the two contract decisions: `denied` gained a live writer in the native runtime
(and `synthesize_failures` was already READING for it — the worst inert shape, a live
reader of a value nobody wrote), while `corrected` was removed from the vocabulary
because the seam that detects a correction cannot attribute it to a tool.
