"""Attribution integrity on the task write paths (#554).

Issue #554 was filed against the COMMENT endpoint: it took `author` from the request
body, so any caller could sign a comment as anyone. That half was closed (the POST route
refuses a supplied `author` and derives it from the owner handle) and is pinned in
`test_tasks_api.py`. This file covers the identical defect on the sibling field the fixed
comment code explicitly claims agreement with — "the same handle `Task.author` is stamped
with on create" — which was still taking `author` straight from the request body on FOUR
paths: `POST /api/tasks`, `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`, and both bulk ops.

Two things make it more than cosmetic:

* `Task.belongs_to` reads `author`, so it decides `?mine=1` and `/api/tasks/ready`. A
  forged author removes a row from the owner's own views — measured below.
* The UPDATE path re-attributed rows that were already honestly signed, which
  `identity.py` forbids in as many words.

Every assertion here reads STORED state (the task JSON on disk), not the response echo —
a handler that answered 400 and wrote anyway would pass a status-only test.

The refusal is deliberately loud rather than a silent drop: a 201 that stored a different
author than the caller asked for tells a forging client it worked and never tells an
honest one its attribution was discarded. So each refusal test is paired with a vacuity
floor — the honest write on the same path still records the acting identity — because
"everything is refused" would otherwise satisfy the refusal half on its own.
