"""The ambient render under ONE budget (§2.4 / §7 crit 5 — S80).

Criterion 5: "the lesson block, skill INDEX, template suggestion, voice/facet blocks, and self-model
snapshot fit ONE per-turn slot-allocated token budget; lessons are never crowded out
(sacrificial-slot truncation only); the authority preamble renders."

**Three inert controls, measured before the module was written.** `allocate()` and
`AUTHORITY_PREAMBLE` had zero callers outside their own module and tests. `learning.
context_budget_tokens` is a fully round-tripped config knob that nothing read. And the blocks were
governed by per-block CHARACTER caps summing to ~36,750 tokens against a declared 4,000. Driven
with 120 realistic lessons the old render exceeded the budget by 1,576 tokens, and at 400+
lessons reached 10,101.

The tests are grouped by the criterion's own clauses: one budget, lessons never crowded out, the
preamble renders. Plus the two defects driving the code found (a header added AFTER the budget was
spent, and the preamble outranking the lessons it speaks for), which are the regressions.

    Driving this corrected the assertion twice. (1) The catalogue is itself text and must be
    AFFORDED — at 500 tokens with 200 lessons, 478 went to lessons and none was left. (2) More
    fundamentally, a lesson's `l0` and `l1` are the SAME string (a correction has no shorter honest
    form), so the greedy fill spends the budget down to a few tokens and the rendered catalogue
    almost never fits for lessons specifically. That is the right trade: a real correction beats a
    note saying one exists.

    So the auditable guarantee is on the ALLOCATION, which `report()` exposes and the observability
    panel can show, rather than on the prompt text. `test_the_report_names_what_did_not_fit` is the
    other half.
