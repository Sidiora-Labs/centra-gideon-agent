"""KL-15's batching core: bounded retry, adaptive bisection, and nothing silently dropped.

The atom names one proof specifically — *"a fake provider that rejects batches above K proves the
bisection converges and that no chunk is silently dropped"* — because that is the property the
design rests on. Providers are removable app bundles, so core cannot know their batch ceilings: a
number core declares is wrong in both directions (too low wastes the batching, too high fails whole
imports). Discovery by bisection replaces the declaration, and the cost of discovering is
logarithmic rather than the import.

What the old path did, for contrast: `embed_item_chunks` called the provider once per chunk inside a
bare `except Exception: vec = None`, so a transient 429 and a permanently unembeddable chunk were
the same outcome, with no retry and no log.

The invariant every test here leans on: `embed_texts` returns a list of EXACTLY `len(texts)`,
positionally aligned. A short or reordered list would attach one chunk's vector to another's text,
and nothing downstream could detect it.
