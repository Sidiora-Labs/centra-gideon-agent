"""Spawn-ceiling audit tripwire (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1, SH1.3a).

Every process-spawning call site in ``src/gideon`` must be *accounted for*: either
it is **ceiling-wrapped** (routed through the post-exec shim via ``create_subprocess_limited``
/ ``spawn_shim_argv``, so an agent-influenced child carries a resource ceiling) or it is
**operator-exempt** (an operator-initiated spawn — the frontend build, the service/update
machinery, the interactive terminal, host-fact probes — which must NOT be constrained).

The census is an AST walk (no import side effects) over every ``subprocess.Popen/run/call/
check_output/check_call``, ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec/shell``, ``os.execv*``, and
``StdioServerParameters`` site. Each is keyed by ``file::qualname::callee``. The keys are
partitioned across two hardcoded allowlists below. **A new, unmapped spawn site reds this
test naming its file:line** — the author must consciously classify it. That conscious step
is the control: an agent-influenced spawn that forgets the ceiling cannot slip in silently.

Adding a site → add its key to exactly one allowlist with a one-line reason. Removing a
site → drop its key. The test fails if the census and the union of the allowlists disagree
in either direction, so a stale allowlist entry is caught too.
