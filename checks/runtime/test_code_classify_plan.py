"""Pure-function tests for the code-kind stage-plan normalizer (_normalize_plan).

The classifier's stage_plan must never produce rows that COLLIDE on their effective
downstream key (stage id, or title for a stageless row) — the store keys
task_list_ids / stage_status by `stage || title`, so a collision silently shares one
TaskList + status entry and corrupts stage advancement. The planner occasionally
blanks the stage id (returning only a title); these tests pin the dedup that guards it.
