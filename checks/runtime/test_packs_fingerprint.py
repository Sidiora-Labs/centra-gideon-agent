"""Project-fingerprint auto-surfacing + the pack_owned update flow (AGENT-PACKS §7/§1, AP-7).

The done_when clauses here are almost all NEGATIVE properties — "no model call", "not on a
read", "installs nothing", "never re-nags", "does not clobber your edit" — and a negative is
only real if something fails when it stops holding. So each block below pins the negative:

* ``test_the_scanner_makes_no_model_call`` + ``test_the_scanner_imports_no_model_seam`` —
  zero-LLM proven twice: dynamically (the ``ModelCallGuard`` attempt-audit sink is wired to
  explode; a scan records nothing) and statically (an AST sweep over the module's imports).
  Prose alone is unfalsifiable, and the dynamic test alone would pass on a lazily-imported
  seam that simply wasn't reached by the fixture's rules.
* ``test_a_scan_needs_one_of_two_reasons`` / ``test_reading_a_project_does_not_scan`` — the
  "on project-create and on-demand ONLY" clause, asserted as the negative.
* ``test_surfacing_writes_nothing`` — propose-only: a full scan with inspect reports leaves the
  home byte-identical.
* ``test_a_rejection_is_remembered_and_never_re_nags`` — the persistence test the never-re-nag
  claim is worthless without.
* ``test_confidence_is_the_declared_ceiling_scaled_by_coverage`` — pins the arithmetic, so the
  number in the UI has a definition rather than a vibe.
* ``test_a_user_edited_component_is_skipped_with_a_drift_note`` — §1's whole point.

Every test binds ``GIDEON_HOME`` to a tmp dir; nothing here may reach the real home.
