"""The session-resurrection audit: a deleted chat stays deleted.

``api_chat_session_delete`` is a HARD delete — it purges the JSONL history, the
tool-result store and the turn-checkpoint tree, precisely so a destroyed conversation
cannot come back (see ``test_chat_hard_delete.py``). Measured on ``origin/main``
against a live gateway, two writers undid that:

* ``POST /api/chat`` naming a hard-deleted key answered **200**, put the key back in
  ``GET /api/chat/sessions`` and served ``GET /api/chat/sessions/{key}`` 200 again —
  carrying only the resurrecting turn, so the conversation returned as a half-session.
* ``POST /api/chat/sessions/{session}/resume`` did the same, with an empty transcript.

There are **50** ``{session}``-addressed routes; ``/resume`` is one of them. Driving the
other 49 against an unknown key on a live gateway, **47 already answered 404**. The two
that did not are both under ``/api/skills/ephemeral/`` and neither writes a chat session:
``GET .../{session}`` answers an empty ``200`` (it lists a collection) and
``POST .../{session}/promote`` answers ``400`` because body validation runs first. So
this is not a missing convention — it is two writers outside an established one.

**What this module audits.** The durable question is *who owns "does this session key
exist, and may it be written?"*. That owner is
:func:`~gideon.dashboard.chat_persistence.session_key_exists`, and the hazard is a
writer that reaches ``state.get_or_create_session`` with a CLIENT-SUPPLIED name without
asking it first — because ``get_or_create_session`` mints a blank session on a miss.

The census is an AST walk (no import side effects) over every
``get_or_create_session`` call site in ``src/gideon``, keyed by
``file::qualname``. The keys are partitioned across the two hardcoded allowlists below.
**A new, unmapped call site reds this test naming its file:line** — the author must
consciously classify it as client-named (and then it must call the owner) or
creates-by-design. That conscious step is the control.

Adding a site → add its key to exactly one allowlist with a one-line reason. Removing a
site → drop its key. The test fails if the census and the union of the allowlists
disagree in either direction, so a stale entry is caught too. Modelled on
``test_spawn_ceiling_audit.py``, whose shape this is.

    ``resolve_session`` answers ``None`` for an ARCHIVED (``closed``) session — it is
    "give me the live session", and a soft-closed chat is not one. But archival is not
    deletion: the conversation is right there on disk, ``/cleanup`` put it away, and
    reopening it is the documented way back (``api_chat_session_resume`` explicitly

    So the archived state is established first and asserted to be REAL — ``resolve_session``
    really does answer ``None`` there — and then both writers are required NOT to refuse
    it. Swap the predicate for ``resolve_session`` and this reds.

    Scope note: what each writer then DOES with an archived transcript is a property of
