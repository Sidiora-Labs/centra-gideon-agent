"""``roadmap-dashboard.html`` must say WHY an atom is not moving, and never guess.

The dashboard used to render every atom that was not done, not in progress and not on the
ready frontier as one grey ``blocked`` bucket, mixing three unrelated situations: a sign-off
or repo or release only the OWNER can produce, a machine / OS grant / live account / price
row this ENVIRONMENT does not have, and plain dependency ordering behind another unfinished
atom. One colour for all three is the same as no colour: the owner cannot see which items are
his, which is the page's whole stated purpose.

Nothing here asserts how many atoms are in any state. That population turns over daily (the
old bucket held 37 at main ``281d693b1`` and 34 three commits later), so a test that pinned a
size would red on someone else's flip; these pin the SHAPE instead.

So the tests here pin the two properties that make the split trustworthy rather than merely
colourful:

* **It partitions.** Every atom lands in exactly one state and the states account for the
  whole catalog, enforced in the generator (not only here) by ``assert_state_partition`` — and
  proven to have teeth by adding a state and watching it red.
* **It refuses to guess.** An atom whose ``blocked_reason`` matches no rule is
  ``unclassified`` and named on the page. The specific trap is provenance prose: "split from
  WF2UNI-12 per owner ruling 2026-08-27" records who decided a split, and reading that as
  "the owner can act" would put an atom that is purely waiting into the owner's queue. A
  wrong classification here is worse than the grey bucket it replaced, because it would be
  acted on.
