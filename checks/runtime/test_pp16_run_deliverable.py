"""A run has a DOCUMENT deliverable, and every way of having none is NAMED (PP-16 unit 1).

PP-16's remaining work is five units, and this file rails the first one — the only one that was
agent-closable, in the atom's own words:

    (1) A RUN-LEVEL DOCUMENT DELIVERABLE — the run-side answer to GET /api/loops/{id}/report
    (store.read_deliverable + read_log, kind-named REPORT.md / MONITOR_LOG.md / DESIGN.md).

Measured on `origin/main` before this change, the run side answered none of it. Of the 26 run
routes, **none served a document**: `outbox` lists PUBLISHED artifacts (a different noun — a
document a worker maintains in place has not been published), `workspace` lists changed FILENAMES
with no content, and `outputs/{node_id}` serves a node's structured output, not a markdown file.
`api.uLoopReport` — the loop half — has had an FE consumer since loops shipped; the run half had
neither route nor panel.

Two families of property, and both matter:

* **Reachability + the DRIVEN mapping.** The filename is not a constant in the new module. It comes
  from walking `loop_aliases` FORWARD and asking each kind's own `deliverable_name`, so this file
  asserts agreement between the derived table and the kinds themselves, in BOTH drift directions —
  a kind that renames its document must move the table, and a table naming a template no kind
  resolves to must red.
* **Absent is not zero, in text.** Five different facts read as "no document" if you render a blank
  panel, and only one of them is a worker that has not written yet. Each is asserted by NAME, and
  the empty-string trap is asserted in both directions: an absent document reports `content: None`,
  and a document someone really wrote nothing into reports `""` and `present: True`.

Vacuity floors throughout: every read runs against a real run store in an isolated home with real
files on disk, and each census asserts it found rows before concluding anything about them.
