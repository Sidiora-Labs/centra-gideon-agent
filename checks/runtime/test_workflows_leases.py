"""Claim leases — the flock-guarded on-disk half of the pure claim logic.

The pure decision (`containers.claim`/`release`) is covered in `test_workflows_containers`.
Here the load-bearing properties are the ones only the FILE + flock give:

* a claim survives the process that took it (the file, not the lock, is the lease);
* an EXPIRED claim on disk is treated as free — a crashed holder frees the work after its
  TTL without an admin step;
* a second holder is refused while the first still holds, and contention (the flock already
  held) is a distinct, non-crashing outcome;
* only the holder may release.
