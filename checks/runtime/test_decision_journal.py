"""The personal decision journal (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §2, atom PA-4).

Every assertion here is aimed at a CALL SITE rather than at the mechanism it drives. The
question each test answers is "would deleting the caller be caught?":

* the type registration tests would go red if ``decision`` were dropped from
  ``NATIVE_TYPES``, from the HTTP handler's type set, or from the Passthrough graph map —
  each with a vacuity assertion beside it, so a rail that stopped matching anything cannot
  read as clean;
* the trigger tests would go red if ``log_decision`` stopped minting the one-shot, if the
  id stopped being deterministic, or if the workflow it names stopped shipping;
* the lesson tests would go red if ``resolve_decision`` stopped calling ``write_lesson`` —
  including the case where the write is REFUSED, because stamping a soft reference at a
  lesson that does not exist is the failure that would otherwise look like success;
* the tool tests drive ``invoke()`` by NAME, so deleting a handler yields "unknown builtin
  tool" rather than a silently unexercised function.

Stores are tmp_path throughout: the core module takes ``store``/``trigger_store``/``memory``
as parameters, so nothing here needs the real home, a gateway, an embedder or a model.
