"""An ANSWERED gate is not a pending gate (bugfix).

**The shipped defect.** `consume_continuation` claims a token by renaming the record aside, and
`list_continuations` globbed `*.json` — which matched the claimed file too. So an answered gate
kept reading as pending for the life of the run, and the user-visible consequence was that a
token-less *"approve it"* stopped working **permanently** the moment a run answered its first
gate: the next approval saw two "pending" gates and refused with `WF_AMBIGUOUS_GATE`.

Measured on `origin/main` before the fix, one live gate plus one answered gate:
`list_continuations` returned **2**, and for a run whose *only* gate was answered it returned
**1** — handing the token-less resolver an already-claimed token, so the honest
`WF_NO_PENDING_GATE` arrived as `WF_RESUME_UNKNOWN_TOKEN` instead.

**Why this is worth a module of its own: one glob answered SIX surfaces.** The token-less
resolver, the needs-input HTTP route, the blocking-mode response body, the introspection
open-asks projection, the controller's per-epoch idempotency check, and the rewind drop all
derive "what is still pending" from `list_continuations`. A claimed record leaking into it is
not one wrong number; it is an answered question re-rendered as an open one on every surface,
plus a rewind that could not reclaim the record at all.

**The shape, and why not the obvious one.** The obvious fix narrows the glob to exclude the
claim suffix — but that hard-codes a sibling's naming convention into every listing, and the
next reader to write its own `glob("*.json")` inherits the same blind spot. Instead the claim is
represented by **location**: the record moves into a `claimed/` subdirectory, which a
non-recursive `*.json` glob cannot match by construction. `os.rename` remains THE claim
primitive, same-filesystem and atomic, so the measured single-use property is untouched —
which is asserted here rather than argued (`test_ATOMICITY_survives_the_new_claim_location`).

Not chosen: `workflows/leases.py`'s shape (a field inside the file with an `expires_at`). A
lease is deliberately *reclaimable* on expiry and is set by a flock-guarded read-modify-write.
A consumed approval must never be reclaimable, and the read-modify-write is precisely the
read-then-unlink race that measured 36/40 double-winners before `os.rename` replaced it.
