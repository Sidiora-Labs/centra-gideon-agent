"""HC-5 shared-core parity (HARNESS-CRAFT §2.3/§3.2, Success Criterion 8).

The `best-of-n` and `check-work` bundled templates are the ENGINE-NATIVE halves of the
same-named bundled skills. The plan's risk table names the failure this module exists to
prevent — "skill/template drift (two behaviors for one name)" — and its mitigation: both
halves call the same §2.1/§3.1 core, templates are thin spec wrappers, and *a shared
test exercises both entry points*. This is that test.

Entry points driven, per template:

* **best-of-n** — the skill's tool (`mcp_subagents._best_of_n`, the call SKILL.md tells
  the presenting model to make) versus the bundled template's own `sample` action node
  dispatched through the v2 engine seam (`workflows.engine.dispatch_action`). The node
  is taken from the REAL `workflows/bundled/best-of-n/workflow.json` and its `with`
  bindings resolved from run inputs, so the template's wiring is what is under test —
  a hand-built node would prove only the provider.
* **check-work** — the §3.1 core (`check_work.derive_and_run`, the documented flow the
  skill executes and the SDLC post-gate hook calls) versus the bundled template's
  `check` action node, same construction.

Model seams are stubbed exactly where `test_sampling_best_of_n.py` stubs them
(`llm_helpers.one_shot_completion` for samples; the judge through
`provider_bridge.resolve_provider_for_use_case`, which is where the core's DEFAULT
factory resolves when no factory is injected — the path both real entry points take).
One stub serves both entry points in each test, so a difference in the answers could
only come from the entry points themselves.

DEVIATION recorded (the note §2.3 owes): the plan sketches "fan-out node → judge node →
select node", but the shipped core does not decompose — its pieces are private and the
concurrency proof, fail-open tiers, tie-break and outcome record span the whole call.
The template therefore calls ``best_of_n`` WHOLE from one action node (the engine sees
fan-out → judge → select as one metered action; the parallelism is the core's own
``asyncio.gather``), and `test_the_template_providers_call_the_cores_not_copies` pins
that the wrappers stay wrappers.
