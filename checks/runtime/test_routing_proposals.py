"""Routing proposals — propose-don't-write, cooldown, basis, SEL (MRT-5 §6.3-6.4).

The central claim under test is negative: the learned stage's proposal path leaves
``routing_policy.json`` **byte-identical**. Asserting "the table grew no new key" would pass for
a path that rewrote the file with the same content, or that touched a sibling key — so these
tests read the raw bytes before and after and compare, and
:func:`test_the_byte_harness_can_see_a_real_write` proves the comparison is not vacuous.

Every test drives ``tmp_path`` as the home. Nothing here may touch the real
``~/.gideon`` or the real SEL.
