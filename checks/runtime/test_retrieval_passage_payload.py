"""KL-18 — the retrieval payload returns the passage that matched, not a neighbor.

Research draft T02: the retriever computes exactly where a match lives
(``line_range`` from ``_attach_locator``), but the tool payload returned
``content[:cap]`` — the document HEAD. For any match deeper than the cap the
model received text that never matched. These tests pin the fix with distinct
sentinel chunks and the exact off-by-one join T02 warns about.
