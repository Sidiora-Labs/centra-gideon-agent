"""Tests for the workspace block, folder contracts and env grants (WORK-CONTAINERS §4, S49).

Three properties, each failing in a chosen direction.

**An ungranted secret is ABSENT, not empty.** An empty string reads to a child as "this
credential is
configured and blank", which produces an authentication failure instead of a missing-configuration
error — and the first is far harder to diagnose.

**A reserved env var is REJECTED, not overridden.** Letting a run set `HOME` or `PATH` lets it
relocate every config file, credential store and binary the rest of the system resolves
through them,
including the machinery enforcing every other rule here.

**A folder contract problem is a WARNING, never fatal.** This reads a format that will grow, and a
strict reader over an evolving format discards the data it was meant to protect — the
23-of-25-dropped-memories bug class.
