"""Shrink-only ratchet for the committed inert-surface inventory (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS SH3.2).

``inert-surface-baseline.json`` is a GENERATED census (by
``scripts/generate_inert_surface_baseline.py``) of *declared-but-inert surfaces* across
five seam kinds — config keys, enum members, trigger kinds, ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` entries,
and SDK exports — each being a place where something is declared and nothing on the other
side of the seam consumes or produces it. That defect passes ordinary tests because they
hand-build the state the missing writer should have created; only a census of both ends
catches it.

This suite is the ratchet that keeps the census honest. It regenerates in-memory and
asserts every per-file inert counter **may only shrink** versus the committed baseline:

  * A per-file counter that ROSE — a NEW declared-but-inert surface — reds CI, naming the
    file and the new surface. This is ``done_when``: "adding a declared-but-unread surface
    reds CI".
  * A DECREASE is welcome (a cleanup added the missing writer/reader). The ratchet does
    NOT demand exact equality and does NOT require the count to go down — only that it
    never goes up. This is why we shipped at the MEASURED population, not zero: a never-run
    gate given teeth at zero would red every pre-existing inert surface at once (an
    outage). See the generator's module docstring.

⚠️  FORBIDDEN-TO-RAISE RULE (the ``done_when`` doc line — do not weaken it): when this test
    reds because a counter ROSE, the fix is to ADD THE MISSING WRITER OR READER for the new
    surface — NEVER to regenerate ``inert-surface-baseline.json`` to bless the higher
    number. Raising a committed count to make CI green re-hides exactly the defect this
    census exists to surface.

# how to update
    Regenerate the committed baseline ONLY when a counter LEGITIMATELY SHRANK (a real
    cleanup landed that wired the missing writer/reader), and do it in that SAME commit::

        python scripts/generate_inert_surface_baseline.py

    Each such cleanup commit should be able to point at the writer/reader it added.
