"""The FE-facing memory surfaces MGAV-9 added: entity topology, slots editor, export.

Each of these exists because something in the panel had no way to reach the backend:

* the proposal queue could DECIDE (``POST .../proposals`` shipped with MGAV-1) but could not
  LIST — a decision surface with no readable queue;
* ``graph_recall_evidence`` was written "for the inspect/recall surfaces" and had zero
  production callers, so a record could not say why recall surfaced it;
* the graph canvas drew records, while the Louvain pass partitions ENTITIES — so the picture
  and the topology block the model reads described different graphs;
* the slots primitive had no editor at all, which made a human-owned register machine-only.

The export test is the load-bearing one: the plan sketched an interactive `graph.html`, and
this repo's export posture forbids script in an exported document. The test pins the static
form so nobody "fixes" it back into something that executes.
