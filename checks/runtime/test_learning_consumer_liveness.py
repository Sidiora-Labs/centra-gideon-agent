"""Consumer-liveness detection — a work unit whose output nobody reads (PP-10).

`PLATFORM-PRIMITIVES` §3. Every watchdog in this repo measures PRODUCER health; nothing asked
whether the output was ever READ. This covers the sweep that does, and the half that makes it a
detector rather than a nag.

Driven end to end against the REAL machinery — the real `publish:` producer
(`workflows/engine._open_publish_outcome`), the real Run Ledger, the real `outcome_resolver`, the
real native artifact provider and pin store, the real proposal queue — under a tmp home. Nothing
here asserts on a mock, because every defect this atom can have is a wiring defect.

What is asserted, and why each clause is load-bearing:

* **the silent half FIRST.** A sweep that fires on a never-opened artifact proves almost nothing —
  anything fires. The assertions that carry the atom are the ones where the artifact WAS touched
  (opened in the dashboard, pulled into a chat turn, pinned, edited) and the sweep says nothing;
* the firing half: three matured cycles with no touch → one `retirement` PROPOSAL;
* **it never acts.** No code path pauses, cancels or retires anything — asserted functionally (the
  runs are untouched after a firing sweep) AND structurally (an AST rail over the module, so a
  later edit that adds a stop cannot pass);
* the horizon: a fresh cycle cannot fire, at two levels — the resolver leaves an in-horizon
  question open, and `dormancy_verdict` refuses a window shorter than `DORMANCY_CYCLES`;
* an UNREADABLE cycle is `INSUFFICIENT`, never `DORMANT` — "we could not tell" must not accumulate
  into "nobody reads this";
* the producer's own writes (`created`, an agent `iterated`) are NOT touches, or every work unit
  would look consumed by itself;
* it reuses `PP-9`'s record — no second counter: the sweep reads `outcome_resolved` rows and the
  horizon comes off the `pending_outcome`;
* it resolves with NO vector store, which is what changed when the publish question moved from a
  semantic-memory metric nothing wrote to a consumption source;
* not nagging: a second sweep reinforces the one row instead of stacking a second, and a REJECTED
  proposal is never re-filed.
