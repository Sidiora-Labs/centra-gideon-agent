"""Active embedding provider resolves the in-process native provider regardless
of which name the active ref uses.

Regression: the active embedding ref is stored with the bundled extension name
``sentence-transformers`` (hyphen), but the native-name check only listed
``sentence_transformers`` (underscore). The mismatch sent the lookup to the LLM
provider registry, which raised ``ProviderResolutionError: unknown provider
entry 'sentence-transformers'`` on every memory-embed attempt during a chat
turn. Both spellings (+ ``native``) must resolve to the one native provider.
