"""The template pipeline's PRODUCTION WIRING (UP-R9/UP-R13.3, WF2UNI-7).

`test_workflows_template_pipeline.py` already proves the pipeline's rules are right. This file
proves they RUN — which is a different claim, and the one that was false: both
`workflows/template_pipeline.py` and `workflows/eval_specs.py` shipped in S45 with zero production
importers, so every rule they implement was correct and unreachable.

So every test here drives a real surface end to end, and the fixtures are deliberately hostile to
the shape of test that would have passed while the code was inert:

* **Mining reads a REAL transcript file.** The records are written to `sessions/<sid>.jsonl` in the
  format `history.ConversationLog.append` actually writes, and the assertion is that
  `workflow_plan` reports what that FILE said. A hand-built record list handed straight to
  `mine_session` is exactly the test that stayed green for a year while nothing called it.
* **The nudge survives a restart.** Persistence is asserted by discarding every in-memory object
  and re-entering through the tool, because an anti-nag rule held in memory is not an anti-nag rule
  — a restart that re-offers a declined shape is the nagging the rules exist to prevent.
* **A frozen candidate comes back through the matcher.** Freezing is only worth doing if the next
  similar intent finds it, so the round trip is driven, not the write alone.
