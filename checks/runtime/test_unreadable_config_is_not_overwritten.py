"""An unreadable config file must never be REPLACED by a write that only knows part of it.

Two defects, one shape: code read a config with a loader that returns ``{}`` (or swallows the
error), mutated the result, and wrote it back. When the file was genuinely absent that creates.
When the file EXISTED but could not be read — a permission blip, a concurrent write caught
mid-flush and therefore momentarily invalid JSON — the same code path DESTROYED it.

  1. ``dashboard/handlers/mcp.py`` — ``_set_scope_entry`` is called with ``~/.claude.json``, a file
     Gideon does not own. Claude Code keeps projects, history and auth state there, not just
     ``mcpServers``, so "enable one MCP server" could replace the user's entire Claude Code config
     with a one-server dict, taking every other server's API keys with it.
  2. ``config/loader.py`` — ``AppConfig.save()`` preserved ``providers``/``use_cases``/``slack``
     from the existing file inside ``except Exception: pass``. A failed read fell through to the
     write with those keys absent, deleting every configured model provider and every stored
     provider API key — on the path every settings toggle uses.

Both writes are ATOMIC, which is why neither left partial-file evidence behind.
