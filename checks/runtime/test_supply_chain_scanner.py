"""The shared install-time content scanner (SkillScanner) — used by both the
skill marketplace and the app platform install gates.

Pattern + structural, no LLM. Verdicts: clean / low / warning / dangerous, with
dangerous reserved for high-confidence malice (terminal, non-overridable) and
trust-tier downgrading trusted provenance. Covers: clean pass, destructive-root,
exfil (sensitive-path + network), remote pipe-exec, obfuscated exec, prompt
injection in prose, zero-width + bidi Unicode, and tier modulation.

Also covers the shape of the EVIDENCE each finding carries, which is what the
install-consent dialog shows a user who is deciding yes/no.
