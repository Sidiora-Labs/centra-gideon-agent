"""The provider-registration invariant: no execution without a policy check (§7 item 6 / R3 am.5).

The plan asks for "a test asserting no execution without a policy check". Measured before writing
it — and the honest result is that the invariant HOLDS today, so this file exists to keep it holding
rather than to fix a defect:

    hooks._run_provider (lifecycle)                  incident_active
    gateway._fire_store_trigger (clock/file/event)   incident_active
    event_triggers.execute_event_action              incident_active
    handlers/triggers._dispatch_store_action (manual) manual_refusal
    handlers/hooks                                   -- reads metadata only, never executes

That last line is the reason this is a source-level test rather than a behavioural one. The
property is *structural*: "every site that reaches a provider passes a policy check first". A
behavioural test can only prove the sites it knows about, so it cannot fail when someone adds a
FIFTH execution site — the exact regression this invariant is written against. The failure mode
prevented is not "the check is wrong", it is "a new call path skipped the check entirely".

🔴 What is deliberately NOT asserted: the plan also describes providers each *declaring* their
enforcement chokepoint as an attribute. Measured: none of the 16 shipped providers declares one.
That is left alone rather than half-built, because an attribute nothing reads is exactly the
inert-control defect this program keeps finding — enforcement lives at the call sites, and this
test guards the call sites. Recorded so the next author knows it was a decision, not an oversight.
