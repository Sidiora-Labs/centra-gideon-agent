"""S73 — the refiner's acceptance discipline (LEARN-R2 / §3.1).

The flagship spoke, and the one with the most ways to go wrong: an optimizer editing templates
run outcomes will random-walk them under judge noise unless the acceptance rules are strict. §3.1's
"acceptance discipline" section is longer than its mechanism section; each gate is asserted here.

**Measured before writing.** Every prerequisite was already in place — `journal.LEDGER_KINDS`
carries
all the events the refiner reads INCLUDING `user_edited_mid_flight` (§3.1's "gold" signal), and
`mutations.OpKind` is a CLOSED ten-op vocabulary, so a diff is expressed in the engine's own terms
rather than in a second edit language needing its own validator.
`test_evidence_kinds_exist_in_the_real_ledger` is what keeps that true.
