"""PEP-7 — artifacts as an indexed knowledge source (PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY §6).

Every claim here is asserted as an OUTCOME a user could observe, not as the presence of a
mechanism:

* "searchable" is asserted by SEARCHING (``search_items_fts`` / the FTS table the list
  endpoint's hybrid retriever reads), never by finding an ``items`` row. The store's FTS5 is
  external-content with NO triggers, so a row written without its ``items_fts`` row is
  perfectly present in ``items`` and invisible to every search — a test that asserted the row
  would pass with search fully broken;
* "not listed" is asserted against the real ``GET /api/knowledge/items`` where-clause
  (``list_items``), not against a helper that mirrors it;
* "backfills exactly once" is asserted by RE-RUNNING the whole startup path and comparing
  counts + the mirror's ``updated_at``, so an idempotence claim cannot pass by never having
  been exercised twice;
* "redacted before indexing" is asserted by searching the index FOR the secret and requiring
  a miss, plus asserting the plaintext is absent from every stored column.

Isolation: ``tmp_path`` home + a ``tmp_path`` sqlite file, so nothing reaches the real home.
