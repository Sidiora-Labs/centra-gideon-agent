"""Hardware-aware model fit — the budget arithmetic and the verdict (LMMV-8).

The defect this module exists to prevent is a budget that counts the same bytes twice. On
Apple Silicon (and any integrated GPU) the "VRAM" a probe reports IS system RAM, so adding
it produces a budget larger than the machine physically holds — which shows a green chip,
takes the user through a multi-gigabyte download, and then OOMs at load. Every arithmetic
test below therefore constructs :class:`HostCapacity` DIRECTLY: a test that probes the real
machine passes or fails by whichever laptop runs it, which is no assertion at all.

Three answers must stay distinct and every test here is ultimately about that distinction:

* ``None`` — the host could not be measured ("unknown").
* ``0`` — the host was measured and nothing fits ("no").
* ``> 0`` — a real budget.

Collapsing ``None`` into ``0`` hides every model from a user whose probe merely failed; the
reverse promises a fit on a machine that has none.

The verdict half carries a VACUITY assertion. ``fit_verdict`` could degenerate to one
constant answer — always green, or always unknown — and every "does it return a verdict"
test would still pass. So one test drives the real shipped whisper variant spread against
one synthetic host and asserts BOTH directions: at least one variant red AND at least one
green, with an explicit failure if all six ever agree.

Nothing here reads the real ``~/.gideon``: no test calls ``configured_reserve_gb()``
or ``hide_unrunnable_default()``, and every reserve is passed explicitly.
