"""Pinned artifacts + the touched-items feed (WORK-CONTAINERS §6.5 R13 — WF2WOR-7).

The dashboard has NO tile registry — the bento grid and per-user layout persistence were
deliberately retired, and widgets are hard-imported. So a pin is a REFERENCE in a list that one
hard-imported widget renders, not a layout entry. These tests pin that shape, because the tempting
wrong version (a per-tile registry) would rebuild the machinery that was removed.
