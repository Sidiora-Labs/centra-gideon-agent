"""KL-20 — knowledge as plain files the owner owns, and the four ways that goes wrong.

The atom's clauses are testable in a very specific way: each one names a defect that looks
like working software from the outside. So the suite is organised around the defects rather
than around the functions:

1. **It is an EXPORT, not ownership.** The projection overwrites an edit made in a text editor
   instead of reading it back. Everything else still passes — files appear, front-matter is
   right, the graph is intact — and the one property the atom is about is absent.
   ``test_owner_edit_is_read_back_not_overwritten`` and
   ``test_read_back_keeps_the_owners_own_subheadings``.
2. **The projection retriggers itself.** The content hash covers the front-matter field the
   projection writes, so writing the hash changes the thing it hashed and every pass finds
   work. Nothing errors; the maintenance host just never idles.
   ``test_projection_does_not_retrigger_itself`` and its hash-scope twin.
3. **A two-sided change resolves silently toward the database.** The owner's edit is applied
   over a change made in the app, or the app's change is applied over the owner's file. Either
   way somebody's text is gone and no surface says so.
   ``test_two_sided_change_surfaces_and_writes_nothing``.
4. **Deletion is not really deletion.** A page the owner deleted comes back on the next tick;
   an item deleted in the app leaves its file behind forever.
   ``test_deleted_page_is_not_recreated`` and ``test_deleted_item_leaves_no_file``.

Plus the two that make the whole thing safe to ship: the gate is OFF by default and provably
turns something on (``test_gate_off_writes_nothing`` / ``test_gate_on_projects_files``), and
every test runs against an isolated home — ``test_the_real_home_is_never_touched`` asserts
that rather than trusting it, because ``config_dir`` patching famously misses a store that
captured its path at import time.
