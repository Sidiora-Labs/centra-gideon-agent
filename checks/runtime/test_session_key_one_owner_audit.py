"""ONE OWNER for a session's on-disk identity — a derived rail, not a hand-list.

A chat session's conversation log lives under one of two key shapes: the bare key (a
channel-provider thread persists under its own key, exactly as the channel app wrote it)
or the ``dashboard:`` form. Deciding WHICH is a question about the disk, and
``chat_utils`` owns it: :func:`resolve_history_key` asks the log which candidate key has
metadata, and :func:`persisted_history_key` wraps that with the write-side fallback.

Two shapes of call site answered the question themselves instead, and both were live
defects:

* ``_history_key_for(x)`` PREFIXES — it never looks at the disk. Eight sites passed its
  answer straight to a ``conversation_log`` read or write, so a session whose file is not
  under that shape got read as empty and written to a second, empty file beside the real
  transcript. ``api_chat_session_delete`` was one of them, which quietly turned a hard
  delete into an orphaned-file leak.
* a raw session NAME off the wire (``request.match_info["session"]``, or a body field
  defaulting to it) is not a key at all. ``api_chat_session_resume`` read four disk facts
  with it and answered ``200`` with ``messages: []`` and ``meta_closed`` still true for
  every non-resident dashboard session — while the canonical form sat computed four lines
  above, used only for an in-memory comparison.

So this rail is a taint analysis for exactly those two edges. It asserts a NEGATIVE (no
site reaches disk from either source), which is why the vacuity floor below matters more
than the assertion: a taint rule that resolves nothing is green for free.

The site set is DERIVED, never listed. The keyed ``ConversationLog`` methods come from
parsing ``history.py`` (every method whose first parameter is ``key``), and the call sites
come from parsing every module under ``dashboard/``. Add a keyed method to
``ConversationLog``, or a new handler, and both are picked up with no edit here.
