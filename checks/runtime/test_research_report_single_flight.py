"""The report lease has a WRITER, so its refusal can actually fire (WF2KNO-12).

The manual-run route refuses with a 409 while ``research-report:<id>`` is held. That check was
written first and, until this seam, nothing ever wrote the claim — a route reading a key no
code sets is a refusal that can never happen, which is the shape this codebase keeps finding
(a live reader of an unwritten key). So three things are asserted here, and each has a way of
looking done while being absent:

* **THE KEY IS ONE STRING.** The runner writes it and the route reads it. Two spellings would
  make the lease silently unmatchable and every assertion about the 409 would still pass on
  each side alone, so the two spellings are compared directly.
* **THE CLAIM IS HELD DURING THE RUN, NOT AROUND IT.** A claim taken and released before the
  work begins satisfies "write_claim was called" while protecting nothing. The assertion runs
  INSIDE the locked body.
* **IT IS RELEASED ON EVERY EXIT.** A run that fails must not wedge the report until the
  claim's self-expiry, so the failing path is asserted too — not just the happy one.
