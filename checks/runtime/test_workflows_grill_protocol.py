"""Tests for the structured `rigor: deep` protocol (UP-R5, S45).

The property carrying this module is that **a question the system could answer itself is never
asked**. A grill that asks what it could look up reads as not having paid attention, and the user
who answers it learns that answering carefully is wasted effort — so the next round gets skimmed.

The second property is that a deferral is not a decision. "You decide" recorded as a confirmed
requirement is the guess-as-requirement failure Step-0 exists to prevent, and it is silent: the plan
looks fully specified.
