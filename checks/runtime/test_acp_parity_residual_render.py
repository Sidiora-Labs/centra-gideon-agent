"""Drift rail for the RENDERED not-gateable residual block (AAP-5 §2.2).

§2.2 requires the residual not-gateable set to be enumerated ONCE, in
:data:`gideon.integrations.acp.permission_authority.NOT_GATEABLE`, and requires §2.7's
parity doc to *render* that registry rather than re-derive it in prose. Before
this rail the doc carried a hand-written table beside the registry, and it had
already drifted: the "Measurement behind it" column stated sweep facts
("44 audited tool events…") that appear nowhere in the registry, and the
per-entry ``observation`` — the field whose job is to name the measurement that
PROVED the residue — was absent from the doc entirely.

Three things are asserted, and the third is the one that matters most:

1. **Drift.** Re-rendering the doc from the live registry is a no-op.
2. **Idempotence.** Rendering twice is the same as rendering once.
3. **Vacuity floor.** A rail that matches nothing reads as clean, which is the
   exact failure mode §2.2 exists to prevent. So: the markers must exist exactly
   once, the block must be non-empty, EVERY registry key must appear in it,
   the rendered provider count must equal the registry's size, every entry's
   ``reason`` AND ``observation`` prose must be present, and the section must
   contain no hand-written table outside the generated block.

The renderer is deliberately shape-loose (scalar dataclass fields render under
their own names; collection-shaped fields are matching machinery and are
skipped), because the registry is co-owned and still moving. The last test pins
that looseness: a synthetic registry with a fourth provider, an extra ``str``
field and an ``Enum``-valued residual state must render without an edit here.
