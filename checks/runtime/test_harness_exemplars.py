"""The exemplars back the done-when: they discover, they run, and they prove the mechanism.

Atom SV-8 (§4.1): `harness/exemplars/` holds a runnable exemplar per landed WF2 slice — a
standalone spec + a ≤30s smoke script + a rationale note — and "a test proves they run".
This is that test. It is the "proves they run" half of the done-when.

Each smoke script drives its exemplar through the REAL engine with a fake/seeded model (no
network, no real LLM), under an isolated GIDEON_HOME, and exits 0 only when the slice's
mechanism produced its expected outcome (e.g. Slice 2's run ends FAILED with the
required_artifacts gate unsatisfied). Running the smoke script — the artifact a human runs —
is what makes this a regression anchor rather than a paraphrase of it.

# the resolution is what let one bug live in all six at once, so the rail is that there is exactly
