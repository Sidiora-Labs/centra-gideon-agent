"""``net-fetch``: the guarded HTTP-egress action provider (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE / WF2KNO-9).

Four load-bearing properties, each with a VACUITY PARTNER that must stay green under the mutation
that reds its sibling — because the cheapest way to fake all four is a provider that never fetches
anything, and every "nothing left the machine" assertion passes trivially against one.

1. **The guard is on the path.** ``_the_wire`` records ONE ordered log of everything that leaves the
   process: the SEL audit row and the HTTP send. A refusal must produce ``[("sel", "denied")]`` and
   nothing else — asserting the ORDER and the absence of a send, not merely the return value.
   Partner: :func:`test_a_permitted_host_is_reached_and_the_audit_precedes_the_send`, which proves
   the recorder can see an ``http`` event at all.
2. **Deny-by-default.** A public, resolvable host with an EMPTY operator allow-list must reach
   nowhere. Partner: the same host, allow-listed, reaching through.
3. **The fence.** Attacker-controlled body text is bounded then fenced, in that order. Partner:
   :func:`test_the_body_actually_arrives`, which proves the assertions are not being satisfied by an
   empty response.
4. **Registration.** ``net-fetch`` is in ``ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS``, so a hook/trigger naming it
   validates. Partner: an unregistered name still being refused, so the schema is not vacuous.

**No network, and no real DNS.** ``gideon.net.guard.socket`` is replaced by a fake resolver
and ``aiohttp``'s session/connector by recorders, so the REAL ``evaluate`` → audit → send sequence
in ``net/client.py`` runs end to end with the sockets removed. Patching ``evaluate`` itself would
have made property 1 untestable.
