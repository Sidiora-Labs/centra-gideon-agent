"""Doctor's Runtime block: one label per fact.

The block printed ``python:`` TWICE — once for the interpreter RUNNING doctor
(``sys.executable``) and once for the INSTALLED venv's interpreter, which are
different facts that can legitimately disagree (doctor launched from a shim while
the gateway venv lives elsewhere). Two rows sharing a label read as a redundant
repeat rather than as two answers, and the venv row's value came straight from
``python3 --version`` stdout, so it rendered ``(Python 3.13.14)`` next to the row
above's ``(3.13.14)`` for what looked like the same thing.

Measured on a real run before the fix:

    Runtime
      python:      ✅ /…/.venv/bin/python (3.13.14)
      backend:   ✅ 0.1.3
      python:      ✅ /…/.venv/bin/python3 (Python 3.13.14)

A duplicated label in the primary diagnostic surface is the kind of defect that
survives forever because each row is individually correct.
