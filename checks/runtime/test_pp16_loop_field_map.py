"""The `Loop` → `WorkflowRun` + `SupervisorPolicy` field map is exhaustive and RESOLVES (PP-16).

`workflows/loop_run_map.py` is a declaration with no runtime consumer — the honesty marker this
program established in `WF2LOO-12` and reused for `PP-14`. A declaration nobody executes rots
silently, so this rail is what makes it a measured map rather than a claim:

* **Both drift directions.** A new `Loop` field with no row reds it (that field is the "feature
  about to be dropped silently" the plan warns about); a row naming a field that no longer exists
  reds it too.
* **Every path resolves.** A `RUN`/`POLICY`/`DEF`/`INTENT` destination is resolved attribute-by-
  attribute against the real dataclass, so renaming `WorkflowRun.elapsed_seconds` — or deleting
  `SupervisorPolicy.idle_secs` — fails HERE instead of at the migration.
* **Every `RUN_INPUT` names a real template input.** The rail re-reads the shipped
  `bundled/*/workflow.json` files and checks the row's parameter against the UNION of what they
  declare — so a parameter no template declares any more reds the row that promised it. (The union,
  not per-template: `task` is declared by four of the six loop-kind templates and two of them name
  it differently, which is the finding the `task` row records.)
* **The homeless list is a ratchet.** `_EXPECTED_HOMELESS` is pinned exactly: a NEW field with no
  home is a deliberate owner decision, and the set must SHRINK as PP-16 lands, never grow quietly.
* **The status delta is computed, not trusted.** `STATUS_VOCABULARY_DELTA` is checked against the
  two enums, so it cannot drift into a comfortable fiction.

Vacuity floors throughout: the resolver is proved to REJECT a bogus path (a resolver that silently
returns `None` would pass every row), and each census asserts it found rows before concluding
anything about them.
