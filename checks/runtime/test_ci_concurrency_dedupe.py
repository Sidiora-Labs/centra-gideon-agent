"""``ci.yml``'s concurrency group must collapse its two triggers onto one key.

Measured 2026-09-07 (issue #2595), from the Actions API rather than the checks tab: every
non-fork PR ran the **entire CI matrix twice, concurrently, on the identical head SHA**.
8 live branches → 16 CI runs → 9 jobs each: ~72 jobs in flight to answer 8 PRs' worth of
questions, against account runner concurrency of 4–6 with ``test`` at ~45 minutes. Half of
all runner capacity was recomputing an answer already in flight, which made this the binding
constraint on merge rate.

The cause was that the group keyed on ``github.ref``, a value the two triggers **disagree
about**: ``refs/pull/<n>/merge`` under ``pull_request`` and ``refs/heads/<branch>`` under
``push``. Different strings → different groups → no dedupe. The guardrail worked *within* a
trigger and could not see *across* the two triggers the same file enables, while its comment
claimed it was preventing wasted runner time.

**Why this asserts a PROPERTY and not a string.** The obvious fix — keying on the head SHA —
also makes the two keys agree, and is wrong: it puts every commit in its own group, so three
pushes leave three live runs instead of cancelling the two superseded ones. That trades the
duplicate-run bug for the very waste the guardrail exists to prevent, and a test that merely
pinned the new expression as text would have happily accepted it. So this file evaluates the
group expression against synthetic event contexts and asserts the four relations that actually
matter:

1. same-repo ``pull_request`` and ``push`` on one branch → the **same** key (the dedupe);
2. two commits on one branch → the **same** key (superseded runs still cancel — this is the
   relation the SHA-keyed "fix" breaks);
3. two different branches → **different** keys (a branch must not cancel its neighbours);
4. two different forks pushing a branch of the same name → **different** keys (no
   cross-contributor cancellation).

Parsed from source with a line scan rather than PyYAML, matching the convention its sibling
``tests/test_ci_tier_enforcement.py`` states: PyYAML is not a declared test dependency.
