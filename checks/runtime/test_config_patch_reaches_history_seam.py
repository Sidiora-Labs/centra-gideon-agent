"""A config PATCH must reach the post-write seam time-travel listens on (DAS-9).

`atomic_write._post_write_hooks` is the ONE place "state just changed on disk" is knowable,
and time-travel's debounced committer is its subscriber. So a writer that rolls its own
tmp+rename is invisible to history: the file lands, and the root it belongs to never gets a
commit.

`PATCH /api/config/gideon` is the primary writer of `config.json` — every toggle in
Settings goes through it — and it used `agent._atomic_json_write`, which does exactly that own
mkstemp+rename. Found by driving a live gateway: three real PATCHes left the `config`
state-history root at `exists=False, commits=0`, while the same write issued through
`atomic_write` produced a `config.git` with a real commit at the debounce boundary. After the
fix the identical drive yields `exists=True, commits=1`.

These tests assert the CALL SITE, not the seam. `atomic_write` has its own tests; what was
broken here was that this handler did not use it, and only a test that drives the handler and
watches the hook can tell those apart.

    🪤 READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING IT AS THE REGRESSION PIN — IT IS NOT ONE. Two successive
    falsifications established the limit. Counting post-write hook invocations does not
    discriminate: something else in the PATCH flow already notifies the seam once for the config
    path (measured — bypass 1 notification, `atomic_write` 2). Asserting the commit does not
    discriminate either, because that other notification creates a pending entry, so both
    `flush()` and `run_pending()` drain it and a commit lands under EITHER writer in this
    harness. The pin for the specific bypass is therefore the source rail at the bottom of this
    file, and the evidence for the change is the live A/B on a real gateway with a fresh home:
    bypass → `config` root `exists=False, commits=0` (reproduced on two separate runs);
    through `atomic_write` → `exists=True, commits=1`. Something about the live path — most
    likely the ordering of that other notification against the final content — makes the
    handler's own notification load-bearing there and not here.

    What this test IS worth keeping for: it pins that a config PATCH ends in a history commit at
