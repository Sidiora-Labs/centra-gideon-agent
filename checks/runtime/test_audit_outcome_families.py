"""The audit surface's outcome filters, checked against the vocabulary writers actually emit.

Settings → Audit log offers outcome filter pills. They used to be defined in the dashboard as
two literal substrings — ``denied`` and ``failed`` — against a log whose writers emit **62**
distinct outcome words. Measured across ``src/gideon``:

    denied 163 · rejected 24 · blocked 5 · refused 1        "Denied" matched 163 of 193
    failure 23 · error 21 · failed 4                        "Failed" matched 4 of 48

and confirmed on a live instance before the fix: a real ``DELETE /api/terminal/sessions/…``
recorded ``outcome=error`` was invisible to the Failed pill (``outcome=failed`` → 0 rows,
``outcome=error`` → 1 row). **On an audit surface a filter that silently omits matching records
is the worst available failure**: the operator reads the empty list as "nothing happened". The
handler already refuses an unknown filter KEY for exactly this reason; the VALUES had no such
guard.

So the families moved next to the log (``sel.AUDIT_OUTCOME_FAMILIES``) and the endpoint ships
them to the panel. These tests are the two invariants that keep them honest, in both directions:

1. no family offers a term no writer emits (a pill that can only ever return zero), and
2. the matcher really is any-of within a field, and still AND across fields.
