"""Regression tests for issue #294 — the dashboard file-explorer roots must follow
the ACTIVE Gideon home (``config_dir()``), never a hardcoded ``~/.gideon``.

Before the fix, ``_dashboard_roots`` added its "Uploads" and "Gideon" roots via
``os.path.expanduser("~/.gideon[/uploads]")``. On a gateway running with a custom
``GIDEON_HOME`` (every dev instance), those two roots resolved to the developer's
REAL home — and because the same roots feed the WRITE allowlist in
``_validate_dashboard_path``, the dashboard could browse AND edit the real home instead
of the active one.

These tests monkeypatch the active home to an isolated ``tmp_path`` exactly the way the
sibling suite (``tests/test_dashboard_file_io.py``) does — patching ``config_dir`` on the
loader module, NEVER the real home — and assert every surfaced root resolves inside the
active home or an explicitly-resolved workspace, and none under the real ``~/.gideon``.
