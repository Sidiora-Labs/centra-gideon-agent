"""S76 — staging-tier observability: the week-at-a-glance panel (§6).

`StagingStore.health()` already answers "is capture working" over a WINDOW, and `record_flush`
already persists `FLUSH_OK/PRODUCED/ERROR/SKIPPED` plus `proposal_ids`. Measured first: the
aggregation hides the one thing this panel exists to show — **a day with ZERO passes is
indistinguishable from a healthy day** in the windowed view, because an absent day contributes
nothing to the outcome counts or the streak. Silent capture death is precisely the failure the
staging tier was built to make visible.

`test_a_silent_day_is_named` is the regression.
