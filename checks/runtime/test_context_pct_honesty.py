"""The context-% surface never states a number the backend did not supply (G8).

ACP-AGENT-PARITY `G8`/`O7`: a `context_usage` frame was emitted every turn with
``pct: 0.0`` and the live telemetry line printed ``context 0%`` on all ~14 turns of an
audited drive — including turns carrying 18 KB of injected context. The producer could
not express "unknown": ``AcpPromptStats.context_pct`` and ``AgentEvent.context_usage_pct``
were bare defaulted floats, so "the adapter told us nothing" and "the context is
genuinely empty" were the same value, and every consumer rendered the second.

The fix makes the measurement optional (``float | None``) end to end. These tests hold
BOTH directions, because each is a real bug this repo has shipped:

* ``None`` (unmeasured) must render NOTHING — no percentage anywhere on the surface.
* ``0.0`` (measured empty) must render ``0%`` — folding a legitimate zero into the
  absent marker is the inverse defect, and it hides a real answer.

Every case below is asserted on the RENDERED surface (the composed line, the API dict)
rather than on the field alone, and each pair is additionally asserted to DISAGREE —
a test that only checks ``is None`` passes just as happily when both cases collapse
again to the same output.
