"""``tools/audit_landed_atoms.py`` must not be able to look clean while measuring nothing.

The tool answers one question — *which ``todo`` atoms are already satisfied by ``main``?* —
and its whole failure mode is silence. A census that matches nothing prints an empty
LANDED-AND-CLEAN bucket, exits ``0``, and is indistinguishable from a roadmap with no drift.
That is exactly how five atoms (``DCU-2``, ``PHF-7``, ``DFE-2``, ``PCS-7``, ``MRT-5``) sat
code-complete on ``main`` for days while reading ``todo``.

So every rail in ``self_check`` is exercised here by **planting the broken condition and
watching it fire**, not by reading the code and agreeing with it. Most tests build a tiny
synthetic ``Corpus``/catalog so they are hermetic and fast; two integration tests run the
real thing against the real repo, because the rails only mean something if they hold on the
data the tool actually reads.

The second half of this file covers the WIRE CHECK (``--check-wires``), whose subject is the
census's own biggest miss: ``APE-3`` scored LANDED-AND-CLEAN with three production call sites
that **no test asserted**, so deleting all three left 116 tests green. The wire check answers
"would deleting the caller be caught?" by actually deleting it, and that makes its own vacuity
problem sharper than the census's: a mutation that silently fails to land reports every wire
as RAILED, and a check that cannot detect a red is indistinguishable from a repo with no
unrailed wires. So the central rail here is a synthetic repo carrying **one railed and one
unrailed wire of the same shape**: the check must separate them. If the mutation degrades to a
no-op the railed case flips to UNRAILED; if it degrades to a parse break both become REFUSED.
Either way this file reds. ``tools/`` is linted by neither ``make lint`` nor CI, so these
assertions are the only enforcement the check has.
