"""Firing the dormant lifecycle events (AUTO §7 criterion 5 — S82).

Criterion 5's second clause: "the 8 dormant lifecycle events actually fire". S67 closed the first
clause (event-kind API parity) and left this one measured but open —
`triggers.events.configurable_but_dead()` returned seven names, and a grep for each outside its own
declaration found exactly ONE hit: the `validation.py` allowlist. Selectable in the hook UI,
saveable, and fired by nothing.

The tests are grouped by what can actually go wrong: the payload contract (a hook receives what the
catalog promised), the FIRE (it reaches a real store), the GATING (an event that means "X happened"
must not fire when X did not), and the never-raise rule (an observer never fails the thing it
observed).
