"""An ARCHIVED chat keeps its transcript, and stays archived until asked otherwise.

Two symptoms of one defect: ``chat_persistence`` and ``chat_handlers`` decided "which
stored conversation does this key name?" and "does the persisted side hold more than my
buffer?" from IN-MEMORY facts.

**Symptom A — data loss.** A send to an archived, non-resident session destroyed its
transcript. ``session_key_exists`` correctly passes an archived key (archival is not
deletion), but the seed refused it, so ``get_or_create_session`` minted a BLANK session
whose ``_resumed_count`` was ``0``. The save guard asked ``_resumed_count > 0 and
len(msgs) <= _resumed_count`` — an in-memory question with an in-memory answer — so it did
not fire, and the blank buffer was written over the real transcript while the rebuilt
metadata line silently dropped ``closed``. Measured on a live gateway: **785 B / 2 turns →
693 B / 1 turn**, un-archived.

**Symptom B — /resume read the bare key against disk.** ``api_chat_session_resume`` took
``body.get("key", name)`` — a session NAME — and handed it to ``get_metadata``, ``_path``
and ``read_messages_chained``, while the canonical form sat computed four lines above and
was used only for an in-memory dedupe. So for a non-resident dashboard session it answered
``200`` with ``messages: []`` and ``meta_closed`` still true, and the clear-``closed``
block no-opped. Masked in practice because the startup restore usually makes the session
resident first, taking the early return.

The two are interlocked, which is why they are one change: making ``closed`` survive a
save is only safe BECAUSE ``/resume`` can now actually clear it. Fix either alone and
archival is either lossy or irreversible.

Every assertion below reads an INDEPENDENT oracle — bytes on disk, the parsed metadata
line, the message count from ``ConversationLog``, or a second endpoint — never the reply
of the route under test.
