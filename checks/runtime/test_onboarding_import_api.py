"""``/api/onboarding/import`` — the onboarding step's two calls (PEP-5).

PEP-4 shipped the engine with no HTTP surface at all; this is the surface, and these
are the properties that make it safe to hand to a first-run screen. Every test drives
the REAL router (``TestClient`` over the registered app), a FIXTURE foreign root bound
through ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR``/``CODEX_HOME``, and a FIXTURE home bound through
``GIDEON_HOME`` — the developer's real ``~/.claude`` is never read and their real
``~/.gideon`` is never written. The fixture asserts both redirects BIND before any
test body runs, because an isolation lever that silently missed would turn this suite
into a scan of the machine it runs on.

The load-bearing tests, one per clause the atom names:

* ``test_fresh_home_scan_shows_the_source_with_nothing_already_imported`` — a fresh home
  with a fixture source shows the step something to offer.
* ``test_planted_secret_appears_nowhere_in_the_scan_response`` /
  ``test_planted_secret_never_reaches_the_home_through_the_route`` — the import completes
  without any secret appearing, over the wire OR on disk.
* ``test_reentry_marks_already_imported_items_existing`` /
  ``test_reimport_reports_existing_and_imports_nothing`` — re-entry shows already-imported
  items as ``existing``, and re-running writes nothing new.
* ``test_a_write_failure_is_reported_with_the_secret_redacted`` — a writer that raises is
  a 500 carrying the failure's own (screened) sentence, never a cheerful empty 200. A
  swallowed write is the defect class this endpoint exists to make impossible.
* ``test_an_unknown_source_is_refused_before_anything_is_read`` /
  ``test_an_empty_selection_is_refused_rather_than_importing_nothing`` — the selection
  axes are validated against the closed registries, and "import nothing" is a refusal
  rather than a success with a zero in it.
