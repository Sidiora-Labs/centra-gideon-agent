"""EI-8 §6.2 — the localhost web preview for a run's dev server.

The claims here are measured against REAL listening sockets, not against a mocked scanner:
the whole feature is "did we correctly attribute a port to this run's workspace", and a fake
``lsof`` would only prove the parser agrees with the fixture that fed it. The two ``-F``
parsers are ALSO tested from fixture strings, because the ``ss`` tier cannot be driven on a
Darwin box and an unverified parser is where this kind of code rots.
