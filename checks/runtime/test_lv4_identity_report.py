"""LV-4 (LEARNING-VISIBILITY T2.4/T2.5): the periodic identity report.

The atom's ``done_when`` is four measurable claims, and each has its own section below:

1. *"counts byte-match store contents"* — every expected count here is derived from the
   STORE, independently of the code under test: raw SQL over ``semantic_memory`` for
   facets and lessons, a directory listing for skills, and the proposal JSON files read by
   this file rather than by ``list_pending()``. A count compared against a constant the
   same author wrote proves only that the author was consistent.
2. *"zero writes to any learning store (inspected before/after)"* — proved by observation,
   with a SHA-256 witness written here (never a helper the production path also calls) over
   the whole ``skills/`` tree plus ``memory.db``'s bytes. The witness carries its own
   vacuity floor: it must be shown to DETECT a write before its silence means anything.
3. *"no-model fixture still produces the deterministic sections"* — both no-model shapes
   (a falsy completion and a raised provider error), asserted against a byte-identical
   comparison with the deterministic compose, plus the working-model control that proves
   the comparison is not vacuous.
4. *"quiet-hours suppresses the ping but not the artifact"* — both directions from ONE
   clock read, so the suppressing and delivering windows differ only in where they sit
   relative to now. A suppression test that would pass with suppression removed is worth
   nothing, so the delivering window IS the vacuity floor.

Every store is redirected under ``tmp_path`` and **every redirect is asserted**. Four of
the five stores bind ``config_dir`` at IMPORT (``inbox``, ``artifacts.native``,
``providers.entity_routes``, and the loader itself), so patching the loader alone would
leave three of them writing into the real ``~/.gideon`` — which matters unusually
much in this file, whose subject is a function that must not write.
