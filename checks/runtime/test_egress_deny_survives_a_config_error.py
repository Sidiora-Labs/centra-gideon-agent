"""A config-read failure must not un-deny a host the operator explicitly denied.

`egress_policy_for` layers `security.egress` onto a base profile behind a deliberately broad
`except` — the docstring says why, and that catch stays: `net` has to stay importable without a
loaded config (tests, early boot).

The defect was that it failed open in ONE direction. On exception it dropped `allow_hosts` and
`allow_private` (safe — the result is narrower than the operator asked for) *and* `deny_hosts`
(not safe — a host they explicitly denied becomes reachable). So a transient config error
silently un-denied a host, and nothing said so.

Fix under test: the last successfully-observed deny list is remembered and reused on a later
failure, and the failure is logged at WARNING. These tests assert the DENIAL still holds through
`guard.evaluate` — the call site an egress actually passes through — rather than only that the
policy object carries a tuple.
