"""Anti-regrowth rail: no NEW vendor residue creeps into core (plan 32).

The provider boundary keeps core provider-agnostic — vendor-specific logic lives in
app bundles. A few vendor-shaped *secret-detection / credential-key* literals are
deliberate keeps (secret patterns can't be renamed without breaking the control; the
CRED_SLACK_* key names are what existing installs hold). This sweep pins that set:

- It scans every core ``src/gideon/**/*.py`` for ACTIONABLE residue —
  vendor SDK imports (``import slack_sdk`` / ``from slack ...``) and vendor
  credential/secret literals (``SLACK_*`` env/cred keys, ``xox`` token patterns).
- Every file with such a hit MUST be listed in
  ``docs/architecture/provider-boundary-keeps.txt`` (the machine-checked keeps
  table). A hit in an unlisted file fails the test (regrowth). A listed file that
  no longer has a hit also fails (stale entry — keep the table honest).

It deliberately does NOT flag vendor *words* in docstrings/comments/prose: core
legitimately documents the reference channel ("Socket-Mode lives in the
slack-channel app"). Only imports + credential/secret literals are residue.
