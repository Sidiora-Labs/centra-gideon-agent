"""`DCU-7` — the human-facing live view + cursor-motion overlay GRANT NOTHING.

DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §3 floor 7 in test form. The atom's done_when is *"the views render;
neither adds any agent capability — asserted by confirming the tool surface is unchanged
with the views on"*, and that clause is a census, not a vibe, so it is asserted three ways
that fail independently:

* **The tool surface is byte-identical with the views on**
  (:func:`test_the_tool_surface_is_unchanged_with_the_views_on`): the seven-tool census is
  pinned by name, and ``tools._list_tools()`` is serialized before and after the views have
  actively rendered — an observed dispatch, a rendered view model, and a served GET — so a
  view that registered, renamed, widened or re-described a tool reds on bytes.
* **No route that can act appeared** (:func:`test_the_computer_use_route_surface_is_pinned`):
  the registered ``/api/computer-use/*`` surface is pinned to exactly one POST (the dispatch,
  `DCU-4`) and one GET (the view). A second acting verb under this prefix is a second chain.
* **The view modules structurally cannot reach the desktop**
  (:func:`test_the_view_modules_import_no_driver_and_reach_no_dispatch`): asserted by AST,
  the same way ``tools.py``'s thinness is — ``overlay``/``render`` import no driver module
  and call neither ``computer_dispatch`` nor ``_run_driver``. The complementary screen-caller
  census (``test_computer_use_call_sites.py``) already sweeps these files for policy calls,
  so a view that started *deciding* reds there without this file changing.

The behavioural half keeps the mirror honest: the trail point for an approved click is the
fresh element's frame centre and it exists BEFORE the driver acts (a wedged driver still
shows the human what was attempted); a refused attempt paints no fake cursor over a click
that will never land; and the view model renders on a disarmed machine, calls no driver, and
scrubs credential-shaped text with the same definition the dispatch's step 7 applies for the
model.
