"""The ready projection on the unified admission core (PP-13).

`pool.frontier`/`pool.next_task` were a second scheduler: a private projection answering *what may
be worked now* with its own ordering and its own leased-work filter, beside the admission core that
answers the same question for the engine. `PP-13` retires it. The ordering became
`admission.rank_key`, the exclusion became the composed `Lease` policy, and `admission.ready` is the
two of them together.

**The deliverable is the equivalence proof, and it is a golden file for the same reason `PP-11`'s
was.** There is no oracle for "does the new scheduler still decide the same thing" once the old one
is deleted, so the old one's output was captured BEFORE the delete, from an unmodified `pool.py`
(`ef8497ed5d29005d6df4cd4acfdba261a2fdedf2facca497f3410dee7627f36f`) at commit `854529a2`, over a
seeded fixture rich enough for the claim to mean something. Both sides read ONE seed file: a
re-stated seed is a second implementation of the fixture, and it would drift.

The fixture is not regenerable — nothing survives to regenerate it from. That is the point of a
retirement, and it is why the vacuity floor below is a test rather than a comment: "identical" over
an empty or single-element list is trivially true, and a comparator proven on one item is proven on
nothing.
