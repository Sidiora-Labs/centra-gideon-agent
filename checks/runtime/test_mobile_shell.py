"""The Capacitor shell wraps the SERVED companion route — rails that keep it a wrapper.

``apps/mobile/`` (MOBILE-COMPANION ``MC-7``) is a Capacitor app whose entire job is to hand a WebView
one URL: ``<gateway>/#/companion``, the route ``apps/console/src/app/App.tsx`` already serves. Its failure
mode is not a crash — it is **drift**, in three directions that a green ``node --test`` cannot see
because each one spans two files this repo builds separately:

1. the shell's route string drifting from the route the SPA registers;
2. the shell's navigation rail drifting from the ``allowNavigation`` list the native platforms
   actually read out of ``capacitor.config.json``;
3. the shell's persisted registry drifting from ``apps/console/src/lib/endpoints.ts``, which owns that
   format and says so — *"two shells that disagree about the format are two shells that cannot
   share a registry."*

Parsed from source, never executed: node is not a test dependency of the Python suite (the
convention ``checks/runtime/test_desktop_seam.py`` set for the same reason — ``apps/desktop/``'s shell-side
modules cannot import core's Python either, so their shared vocabulary is held by a rail). The
behavioural half lives in ``apps/mobile/test/*.test.mjs`` and runs in CI as ``npm run test:mobile``,
which ``checks/runtime/test_ci_tier_enforcement.py`` requires to exist.

**What no rail here can prove:** that a real iPhone or Android device renders the companion inside
its safe area. Those two keys are read by native code, so the assertions below establish only that
they are shipped. See the dated PARTIAL in `the MOBILE-COMPANION plan (internal, not in this repo)`.
