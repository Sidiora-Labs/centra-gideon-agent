"""SECURITY-HARDENING SH-8 — the SEL audit surface.

Rails for the four properties this surface can silently get wrong:

* **Pagination stability.** The log is append-only and read newest-first, so an
  offset scheme duplicates rows after a concurrent append and SKIPS rows after a
  prune. Skipping is the one that matters: the surface would omit events while
  looking complete. Proven by appending BETWEEN two page fetches.
* **Authorization.** The audit trail spans every actor on the instance, so an
  app-scoped token is refused categorically — with a 403, never a 200 carrying an
  empty list (which reads as "your agent did nothing").
* **Credential safety.** Records carry truncated real tool arguments. A planted
  secret must not survive into the read surface, and the per-record integrity
  verdict must still be computed on the RAW line — redacting first would rewrite
  the payload the HMAC covers and report every record as tampered.
* **Fail-closed filtering.** A malformed filter is refused, not ignored. An
  ignored filter returns the whole log while looking like it narrowed it.

Isolation: ``GIDEON_HOME`` is redirected per test, and ``conftest``'s autouse
``_reset_sel_singleton`` guarantees the handler's ``sel()`` binds to it rather than
inheriting an earlier test's directory. ``test_real_home_untouched`` asserts the
outcome directly — SEL events are exactly the state that leaks into a real home.
