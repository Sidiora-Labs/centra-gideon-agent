"""Workspace provisioning + teardown wiring (WORK-CONTAINERS §4.1, WF2WOR-4).

S49 and S52 shipped the two DECISION layers and both had zero production callers, so a spec's
`workspace:` block was parsed nowhere and every run silently ran in place. These tests pin the
performer and its two call sites, and they drive a REAL git repo for the same reason S52 did: the
properties under test are facts about git's behaviour, not about our wrappers.

Four things were MEASURED against a real repo before writing the module, and three of them
changed the design:

* `git add -A` in a worktree commits the preserved `.env` AND `.gideon-setup/` into the run branch.
  So the durable record of a run's work would carry the user's local credentials into git history,
  and both reintegration verbs would then offer to apply them. `_commit_outstanding` excludes them
  with git pathspecs at the ADD, not at review time — a review filter cannot un-commit a secret.
* `git branch -m` on a branch checked out in a LIVE worktree succeeds and the worktree follows it,
  which is what makes the task→run branch rename free. But `-m` onto an EXISTING name fails with
  fatal 128, and a retried run finds its own previous run-branch already there — so it is `-M`.
* `git commit` with nothing staged exits 1 with "nothing added to commit". That means "there was
  nothing to save", not "saving failed", so it is not an error.
* `git checkout <branch>` REFUSES a branch a live worktree holds (fatal 128). That is why both
  verbs are offers the user runs rather than actions the gateway performs — the safe order depends
  on state the gateway does not own.

Isolation: `GIDEON_HOME` is set, not just `config_dir` patched. Measured previously (S52):
patching the module attribute redirected every consumer and broke an unrelated test in the full
xdist mix.
