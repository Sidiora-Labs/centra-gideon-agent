"""Shared prompt blocks and the template lint (Slice 9b, WF2-R15).

Six templates independently defined the Finding record THREE times. That is the problem in one
sentence: a convention repeated by hand drifts, and drift in a Finding record breaks things far
from the text — a gate predicate like "no open Critical" stops being meaningful once one stage
grades on a different ladder, and the Run Ledger stops being minable by the flywheel.

So a template writes `{{block:finding-record}}` and the text is substituted at DEFINITION time,
next to macro expansion and for the same reason: what is stored, what is validated and what the
engine runs are one tree, and no run-time component learns blocks exist.

The lint is the other half. `validate_spec` answers "will the engine run this?"; the lint answers
"does this follow the conventions that keep a growing library coherent?" — which is an authoring
standard, not a run requirement, and therefore advice for a user's own workflow and a hard gate
for the shipped library.
