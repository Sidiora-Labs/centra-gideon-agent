"""Criterion 3: a failing automation autopauses after 5 TRUE failures (§3.7 — S139).

Criterion 3: *"A failing automation autopauses after 5 **true** failures (typed exits —
auth/transport outages **park** instead) and surfaces in the Runs inbox."*

🔴 THE DEFECT — three layers, each dead:

1. **`triggers/autopause.py` was imported by NO production module.** Thirteen functions implementing
   the whole decision — typed exits, the 5-failure budget, parking for transport outages, immediate
   pause for config errors, the attention card — reachable only from tests.
2. **The fire path DISCARDED the provider's result.** `await provider.execute(...)` threw its return
   value away, so nothing knew whether a fire succeeded.
3. **No ledger row was written per fire.** `_record_run` died with `ScheduleService` (S112) and
nothing
   replaced it on this path, so even a wired counter would have counted zero forever.

Driven before writing: six consecutive failing provider runs left the trigger `enabled: True`,
`health_status: 'ok'`, `last_failure_at: ''`. The decision engine was complete and unreachable.

**Two bugs found by driving the fix, both worth recording.** Parking worked before the budget did —
because parking is STATELESS (derived from the exception type) while the budget is STATEFUL, so the
missing ledger row broke only the half that needed history. And the first working version paused
after
**four** failures: `evaluate` adds its own unit (`count = consecutive_failures + 1`), so the count
passed in must be the streak BEFORE this fire, not including the row just written.
