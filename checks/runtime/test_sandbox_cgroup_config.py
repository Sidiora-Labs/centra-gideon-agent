"""The ``sandbox.cgroup_scopes`` config round-trip (PHF-2).

The cgroup tier is enforcement machinery in ``sandbox.py``; this file covers the
CONFIG contract that makes it reachable, point by point. A partially wired field is
the exact failure this repo's round-trip contract exists to prevent — a knob that
loads but has no ``_meta`` cannot be rendered, one that has ``_meta`` but no
``load()`` wiring silently reverts to its default on every reload, and one absent
from ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` is unreachable from the API and therefore from any UI.

Every test drives config through a ``config_path`` patched at ``tmp_path``; nothing
here touches the real home.
