"""The verification call site, and the tristate it must not collapse (TASKS-SOPS §1 — S61h).

`verified_done` was built in S56 as pure decision functions. Like `materialize` before
S61f, it had no
caller — a projected node's `done_criterion` was never executed by a run.

The defect this session found in its OWN first draft is the one worth reading: the
criterion evaluator
returns a TRISTATE (`True` / `False` / `None` = could not run), and the emitter wrote
`bool(passed)`.
`bool(None)` is `False`, so a criterion whose binary was missing reported **"your check failed"** —
sending the user to debug their code when the problem is their environment. §1 projects those two to
DIFFERENT blocked kinds (`needs_input` vs `capability`) precisely because they need different fixes,
so collapsing them at the emitter threw away the distinction the taxonomy exists to make.

Measured on real runs: a passing criterion, a failing one, and a missing binary now produce three
distinguishable outcomes.
