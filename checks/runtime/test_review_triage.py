"""EI-9 — line-anchored review findings, human triage, accepted-subset dispatch.

The atom's `done_when` is SC9: *"a workflow review stage emits line-anchored findings; the triage
panel validates anchors against the real diff; the user accepts 2 of 5; the accepted pair
auto-dispatches to the originating worker which applies them; rejected findings land in the
calibration record; nothing was auto-written without acceptance"*.

Two of those clauses need more than a happy path, and this module is organized around them:

**"Nothing was auto-written without acceptance" is a NEGATIVE property**, so a test that only
checks the accepted pair arrives proves nothing about it. `TestNothingIsWrittenWithoutAcceptance`
asserts the write path is NOT REACHED — the delivery seam is a spy that records every call, and
the assertion is on the absence of a call and on the absence of the rejected text from what WAS
sent. The vacuity leg lives in the same class: the accepted pair DOES reach the same spy through
the same function, so an assertion that could never fail is ruled out by construction.

**"Validates anchors against the real diff"** needs the stale case, not the matching one. An anchor
that no longer matches the diff must be reported UNANCHORED — never silently applied at whatever
now occupies that line number, which is the worst failure this feature can have.
