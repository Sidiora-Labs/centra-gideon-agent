"""The library home's read route (KNOWLEDGE-LIBRARY S3, T3.3 / `KL-8`).

`GET /api/knowledge/library-home` answers the four questions the library landing surface asks —
what did I just add, what am I part-way through, what did I keep, what is on my shelves — in ONE
read, so a failure is one failure the client can name instead of three populated shelves beside a
fourth that is blank for an invisible reason.

What these tests hold, and why each one is here rather than assumed:

* **The route is REGISTERED.** A handler with no `app.router.add_get` is the inert-control shape
  this repo keeps finding; the definition existing proves nothing. Asserted against the real
  route table, with an obviously-bogus sibling path asserted ABSENT so the check cannot pass
  vacuously.
* **Each shelf selects on its own column** — and, more to the point, each shelf EXCLUDES what the
  library list excludes. A home that shows archived rows, mirrored artifacts or
  `DEFAULT_LIST_EXCLUDED_KINDS` puts items on the landing surface that vanish the moment the user
  clicks through to the list.
* **A collection count cannot disagree with the shelf it labels.** `list_collections`'
  `item_count` counts every membership row including archived items, while `resolve_collection`
  hides them — so the existing rail number can EXCEED what opening the shelf shows. This route
  derives the count from the same predicate as the resolve, and the test proves the equality on
  the exact input that separates the two (a shelf holding one live and one archived item).
* **Empty is a real answer, not an error.** Four empty shelves on a fresh library must be a 200
  with empty lists, because the surface's empty states are what turn that into a sentence.
