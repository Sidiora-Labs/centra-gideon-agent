"""Tests for the template-creation pipeline (UP-R9, S45).

Two properties carry this module.

**A denial is a decision.** A tool the user refused in a session must never appear in the mined
template's permission signature. A miner that only counted successes would silently re-request it,
and the user would be re-asked for something they already said no to — which reads as the system
overriding them rather than forgetting.

**Over-scrubbing is worse than under-scrubbing.** A template whose prompt reads `{entity_1}
{entity_2} {entity_3}` has scrubbed away the sentence, not the entities. So the scrubber is measured
against the ways it can be too eager: sentence-initial capitals, domain acronyms, short words.
