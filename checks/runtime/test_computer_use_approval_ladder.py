"""`DCU-5` — the approval ladder at the desktop-drive seam (DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE §3.4).

The clause is *"an unattended run without the grant refuses and notifies; an interactive run
prompts"*, and every part of it is a claim about a CALL SITE rather than about a function:

1. **The refusal happens through ``service.computer_dispatch``**, not by this file calling
   ``policy.check_autonomy`` directly. `DCU-2` shipped three correct screens with zero callers
   and its own audit had to censure them; a suite that only drives the screen would reproduce
   exactly that. Every refusal here goes in at the dispatch, and the census in
   ``test_computer_use_call_sites.py`` is the flipped half (the screen has ONE caller, and
   removing it reds).
2. **The permitted rung goes through the SAME code path and succeeds.** A refusal test alone
   passes against a dispatch that refuses everything, so each guard below has a leg where the
   grant is present, the driver is reached, and the result comes back. Without it the refusal
   proves nothing.
3. **The notification is a durable row**, read back out of a real ``InboxStore`` in an isolated
   home — not an assertion that ``emit_attention_item`` was called.
4. **The rung comes from the ladder.** ``guardrails.autonomy`` owns the four rung names and this
   atom adds none; what it adds is one DECLARATION (``rungs.COMPUTER_USE_DRIVE``) at the
   existing ``one_tap``. ``test_the_declaration_is_what_makes_this_an_ask`` pins that, because
   ``announce_withheld`` files a row for ``ask``/``draft`` and NOTHING for a route that
   executes — so a widened declaration would silently drop the "and notifies" half while every
   other test here stayed green.

🪤 **The ladder registry is process-global and lazy.** ``resolve_rung`` fails closed to
``draft_only`` for a declared key with no registration, and the gateway registers the core
declarations from the action-provider seam — a path a computer-use dispatch never travels. The
refusal would still refuse, so nothing would look broken; it would file a *proposal* ("here is
what it would have done") instead of an *agent request* ("decide"). ``check_autonomy`` calls
``ensure_core_action_types()`` for that reason and ``test_the_hold_row_is_a_request_from_a_cold
_registry`` is the rail: it clears the registry first.

**No test in this file touches the real home.** ``GIDEON_HOME``, ``config_dir``,
``config_path`` and the keystone path are all redirected per test, and the ladder/inbox stores
resolve under them.
