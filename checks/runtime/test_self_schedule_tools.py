"""`WF2LOO-9` — an agent may schedule itself, under a bound the operator controls.

Two things were missing. `automation_create` could already build either shape, but an agent
scheduling ITSELF is a different act from an agent building the user an automation, and only the
tool name makes that difference legible in the tool log and the approval prompt. And the one bound
standing between a self-scheduling agent and an unbounded fan-out of clocks was a **module
constant** — `MAX_AGENT_TRIGGERS = 20` — so an operator who wanted 5, or 0, had to edit the source.

Both tools route through `triggers.tools.create(created_by="agent")` rather than reaching the store,
which is why they inherit the bound, the command screening and the on-creation announcement instead
of re-implementing any of them. These tests assert that routing, because a tool that wrote directly
would look identical until the day it mattered.
