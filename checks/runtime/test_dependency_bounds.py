"""Optional-dependency specs whose imports name a version-sensitive symbol stay bounded.

A `>=` spec with no upper bound is not a preference, it is a bet that every future major
release keeps the symbols this repo imports. `mcp` lost that bet: `mcp 2.0.0` renamed
`mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client`, which `gideon/mcp_client.py`
imports by name for the streamable-HTTP transport. The repo's own venv had `mcp 1.28.1`
and was green, so nothing here failed — and **CI installs from the lockfile, so CI could
not see it either**. Only a fresh `pip install 'gideon[mcp]'` resolved 2.0.0 and
broke, which is the one path a new user takes.

This rail asserts an upper bound on the extras whose modules are imported for a *named*
attribute. It deliberately does not police every extra: a bound costs real maintenance
(someone must widen it), so it is spent where a rename is known to break an import rather
than everywhere as a matter of style.
