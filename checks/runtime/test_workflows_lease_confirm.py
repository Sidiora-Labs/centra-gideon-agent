"""The lease WRITE path and the confirmation resolve endpoint (TASKS-SOPS §5 R10 / §4 R6 — S61d).

S60 built the lease DECISION rules as pure functions and S57 built the confirmation verbs. Neither
had durability or a caller. This session adds both, and the interesting properties were measured
rather than assumed:

**The lease survives real process contention.** Eight separate PROCESSES racing one task through
`claim_task`, 12 trials: 0 multi-winner. That is the property the whole mechanism exists
for — S57 measured the read-then-`unlink` version of a related primitive letting multiple
callers through in 36 of 40 races, and a lease that loses a race is worse than no lease at
all, because both holders believe they own the work. The in-process test below pins the same
rule; the cross-process run is recorded in the plan's execution log.

**A confirmation resolve must not pass the VERB as the gate's answer.** The engine's gate resolution
reads an approval boolean, so handing it `"reject"` would make a rejection truthy — the single worst
mistranslation available in this path. `resolve_confirmation` converts to `resolution.approved`.

    `run_id` — so for an id that names nothing, the 200 described something that cannot exist, and a

    control verbs already answered 404 on the same id.
