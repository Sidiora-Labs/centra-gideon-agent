"""`knowledge-propose` — the workflow path into the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL review queue.

WF2KNO-8 (KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §3.3/§3.4). Three things are worth a test here, and none of
them are the happy path on its own:

1. **The wiring.** A provider registered in one set and absent from the other validates,
   saves, and then fails at run time — so the template's node name, the registry, the hook
   allowlist and the capability fence are all asserted.
2. **The silent drop.** `proposals.enqueue` SKIPS an unknown kind and logs at *debug*. That
   is what made the pre-WF2KNO-8 workaround necessary and invisible, so the kind's presence
   is asserted directly rather than inferred from a green filing.
3. **SKIP is success.** A prior decision forbidding a re-file is the queue working. A
   provider that failed the node on it would make a correct cadence look broken.
