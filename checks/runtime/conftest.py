    """Make an UNSPECIFIED home mean a per-test tmp dir instead of the developer's
    real ``~/.gideon`` (CRE-8).

    The hazard, measured rather than assumed: a plain
    ``pytest -k "project or memory or knowledge or recall"`` appended **44,402 bytes** of
    `artifact_save`/`tool_invocation` rows to the user's real
    ``~/.gideon/security_events.jsonl`` and created/rewrote 62 more real-home entries
    (`tasks/*.json`, `codegraph/*.db`, `workspace/_ext/*/memory/*.md`, `prompts/`,
    `prompt_snippets/`, `learning.db`, `session_search.db`, `tokenjuice_savings.json`, …).
    Thirteen distinct writer families, and every one of them reached the real home through
    the same two seams: ``config.loader.config_dir()`` (153 call sites) and SEL's own
    ``sel._default_dir()``. Patching thirteen subsystems one at a time would have been
    thirteen fixtures guarding one seam, and the fourteenth subsystem would leak again.

    So this redirects those two seams, and ONLY when the caller expressed no preference:

    * ``$GIDEON_HOME`` set (to anything, **including the real home**) → pass through
      untouched. Several rails deliberately point it at the real home and assert a refusal
      (``test_cli_gateway_flags``'s ``--approval yolo`` rails, ``test_seed``'s main-home
      rails); redirecting an explicit choice would make those rails vacuous.
    * ``$HOME``/``Path.home()`` repointed by the test → pass through untouched. That test
      already isolated itself, and its assertions read back from *its* home.
    * neither → the resolution would be the real home purely by default. Redirect.

    Deliberately NOT done, both previously rejected in this repo and re-rejected here:
    a global ``$GIDEON_HOME`` for pytest jobs (CRE-6 removed exactly that: it takes
    precedence over ``Path.home()`` inside ``config_dir``, so it defeats the tests that
    assert env precedence and the ones that assert the default resolution), and a blanket
    ``Path.home`` patch (see ``_isolate_session_map`` — it breaks the real-home safety
    rails, and it would also silently redefine the unrelated ``Path.home()/".aws"`` and
    ``Path.home()/".ssh"`` paths that the artifact/task sensitivity tests assert on).

    What a fixture CANNOT reach, and therefore was fixed at source instead: a home resolved
    into a module-level constant at import time. The rail below caught 147 real-home entries
    still landing in ``subagents/`` after this fixture was in place, because
    ``subagent_persistence`` froze ``config_dir() / "subagents"`` at first import — before any
    fixture exists. Three such constants were converted to call-time resolvers
    (``subagent_persistence._subagents_dir``, ``session_map._sessions_dir``, and a dead
    ``schedule._DEFAULT_DIR`` whose import-time ``config_dir()`` mkdir'd the real home merely
    by importing the module). If a new leak appears here, check for that shape first.

    Ordering matters: this fixture is declared BEFORE ``_reset_sel_singleton`` so it is set
    up first and torn down LAST. The singleton is cleared around every test, so the next
    ``sel()`` call constructs a fresh ``SecurityEventLog`` — and that construction must
    still find the redirected ``_default_dir``, or the leak comes straight back.

    `~/.gideon/triggers.json`. Any new path that WRITES a store built from `config_dir()`
    has to be redirected here too.

    🔴 The THIRD seam was added in S108: `_init_cron` now runs the app-cron and digest reconcilers

    Levels are snapshotted for the whole ``gideon.*`` namespace (not a name list —

    Deliberately NOT done: closing on a weak reference (a connection already collected
    has already warned), and swallowing every teardown error. ``ProgrammingError`` is
    the one documented case that is not this fixture's business — a connection opened

def _restore_provider_registry() -> object:
    """Undo any provider-registry ENTRY a test registers into the process-global singleton, and
    restore the singleton ITSELF if a test reset or swapped it.

    `get_default_registry()` is a module-level singleton, so an entry a test registers outlives it
    and lands in whatever test shares the worker next. Snapshot-and-restore rather than a list of
    known names: three separate files leak (`test_can_resolve_use_case`, `test_provider_resolution_
    unify`, `test_provider_create_bedrock`), each under names of its own, and a name list silently
    stops covering the next one added.

    Measured symptoms — both deterministic in an xdist mix, both invisible in isolation, both in
    files with nothing to do with provider resolution:

    * a leaked CHAT-capable entry makes `workflows.preflight`'s `can_resolve_use_case` probe
      succeed, so `test_workflows_api.py`'s preflight-422 test got a 202 — a workflow run STARTED
      because another file had left a model provider behind;
    * a leaked `acp_agent` entry made `cli_doctor` exit 1 in `test_cli.py`.

    The singleton IDENTITY is restored too, and this is what the sharded suite exposed. Provider
    modules register their TYPES at IMPORT time — `gideon.integrations.llm.__init__` eager-imports
    `acp_agent`, wiring the `acp_agent` type — and those modules are then cached in `sys.modules`.
    So a test that calls `reset_default_registry()` / `set_default_registry(...)` (several do, in
    their own autouse fixtures: `test_ea5_capture_proxy`, `test_ea5_capture_client_upstream`,
    `test_scripted_provider_binding`, `test_evals_cell_provider`, `test_seed_local_model`) swaps in
    a FRESH, TYPELESS registry that the cached modules never re-populate — and the next test on
    the worker then dies with `unknown provider type 'acp_agent'`. It was invisible until #2720
    sharded the suite: with fewer xdist workers a resetting test and
    `test_provider_resolution_unify`'s `acp_agent` cases land on the same worker in sequence.
    Restoring the original object (which still carries its import-time type registrations) heals
    it; the `is` check makes the restore a no-op for the tests that already save/restore the
    singleton themselves (`test_acp_bundles`, `test_agent_providers_endpoint`). Registered TYPES on
    the original are still left alone (there is no `unregister_type`, so a mutation that would drop
    a type can only be a reset/swap, which this catches): `register_type` is how a test simulates
    an installed provider app, it is idempotent, and a type with no entry resolves nothing.

    Measured while landing that change: three `test_gateway.py` tests went red only in a mix —
    `test_services_initially_none` asserts a fresh orchestrator has NO delivery, and a leaked

    offered, and a cross-test hazard of the same class as `_restore_provider_registry` above: an
    entry a test registers outlives it and lands in whatever test shares the worker next.

    Measured, invisible in isolation, deterministic-per-schedule in a mix, and the leak #2720's
    sharding exposed on shard 1: `dashboard.server`'s API-server STARTUP path registers the three
    core source providers (`DirSourceProvider`/`FeedSourceProvider`/`WebSourceProvider` — the
    `watched-dir`/`watched-feed`/`watched-page` kinds) and never unregisters them (a gateway

    `test_a_kind_with_no_enrolled_provider_is_not_offered` — which enrols NOTHING and asserts the
    offered kinds are `[]` — then sees those three and reds. (`test_knowledge_sources_api`'s own
