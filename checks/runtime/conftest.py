def _isolate_real_home_writers(tmp_path_factory, monkeypatch):
    """Make an UNSPECIFIED home mean a per-test tmp dir instead of the developer's
    real ``~/.gideon`` (CRE-8).

    The hazard, measured rather than assumed: a plain
    ``pytest -k "project or memory or knowledge or recall"`` appended **44,402 bytes** of
    `artifact_save`/`tool_invocation` rows to the user's real
    ``~/.gideon/security_events.jsonl`` and created/rewrote 62 more real-home entries
    (`tasks/*.json`, `codegraph/*.db`, `workspace/_ext/*/memory/*.md`, `prompts/`,
    `prompt_snippets/`, `learning.db`, `session_search.db`, `tokenjuice_savings.json`, …).
    Thirteen distinct writer families, and every one of them reached the real home through
    the same two seams: ``config.loader.config_dir()`` (153 call sites) and SEL's own
    ``sel._default_dir()``. Patching thirteen subsystems one at a time would have been
    thirteen fixtures guarding one seam, and the fourteenth subsystem would leak again.

    So this redirects those two seams, and ONLY when the caller expressed no preference:

    * ``$GIDEON_HOME`` set (to anything, **including the real home**) → pass through
      untouched. Several rails deliberately point it at the real home and assert a refusal
      (``test_cli_gateway_flags``'s ``--approval yolo`` rails, ``test_seed``'s main-home
      rails); redirecting an explicit choice would make those rails vacuous.
    * ``$HOME``/``Path.home()`` repointed by the test → pass through untouched. That test
      already isolated itself, and its assertions read back from *its* home.
    * neither → the resolution would be the real home purely by default. Redirect.

    Deliberately NOT done, both previously rejected in this repo and re-rejected here:
    a global ``$GIDEON_HOME`` for pytest jobs (CRE-6 removed exactly that: it takes
    precedence over ``Path.home()`` inside ``config_dir``, so it defeats the tests that
    assert env precedence and the ones that assert the default resolution), and a blanket
    ``Path.home`` patch (see ``_isolate_session_map`` — it breaks the real-home safety
    rails, and it would also silently redefine the unrelated ``Path.home()/".aws"`` and
    ``Path.home()/".ssh"`` paths that the artifact/task sensitivity tests assert on).

    What a fixture CANNOT reach, and therefore was fixed at source instead: a home resolved
    into a module-level constant at import time. The rail below caught 147 real-home entries
    still landing in ``subagents/`` after this fixture was in place, because
    ``subagent_persistence`` froze ``config_dir() / "subagents"`` at first import — before any
    fixture exists. Three such constants were converted to call-time resolvers
    (``subagent_persistence._subagents_dir``, ``session_map._sessions_dir``, and a dead
    ``schedule._DEFAULT_DIR`` whose import-time ``config_dir()`` mkdir'd the real home merely
    by importing the module). If a new leak appears here, check for that shape first.

    Ordering matters: this fixture is declared BEFORE ``_reset_sel_singleton`` so it is set
    up first and torn down LAST. The singleton is cleared around every test, so the next
    ``sel()`` call constructs a fresh ``SecurityEventLog`` — and that construction must
    still find the redirected ``_default_dir``, or the leak comes straight back.

    🔴 The second seam was added in S101: re-pointing the `/api/triggers` WRITES means the

    has to be redirected here too.

    🔴 The THIRD seam was added in S108: `_init_cron` now runs the app-cron and digest reconcilers

    calls wrote `system:notification-digest` into the USER's real store (reproduced by deleting the

    ``ResourceWarning: unclosed database in <sqlite3.Connection …>`` lines, attributed
    to **95 test files** — knowledge, memory, durability, codegraph, learning, lexicon,
    session-search, snapshot, loop. The shape is the same everywhere and it is not one
    store's bug: a fixture builds a store, returns it, and nothing ever calls
    ``close()``, so the connection survives the test and is finalized whenever a later
    ``gc.collect()`` gets to it (the warning is raised from pytest's own
    ``unraisableexception`` plugin, i.e. attributed to a *bystander* test). Every
    connection held that way is a live OS handle and a WAL reader on a tmp dir the test
    is done with, and under ``-n auto`` each worker accumulates its own backlog.

    96th store would leak again — the same argument :func:`_isolate_real_home_writers`
    makes about ``config_dir()``. So this wraps the seam every store shares: the
    ``connect`` of the sqlite driver module. Both bindings are patched — the stdlib
    module (six stores still ``import sqlite3`` directly) and the one

    patching only the stdlib would miss every store that goes through the shared
    binding — see the driver-mismatch hazard in ``sqlite_compat``'s docstring).

    Deliberately NOT done: closing on a weak reference (a connection already collected
    has already warned), and swallowing every teardown error. ``ProgrammingError`` is
    the one documented case that is not this fixture's business — a connection opened
    with the default ``check_same_thread=True`` inside a worker thread may only be
    closed by that thread — and it is the ONLY exception passed over.

    This fixture alone did NOT reach zero: 12 warnings survived, from five production
    sites using ``with sqlite3.connect(...)``, whose context manager ends the
    TRANSACTION and leaves the connection open — and which, being opened inside worker
