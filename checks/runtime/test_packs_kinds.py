"""Pack KINDS — Domain OS packs, rosters, prompt cards, one-link (AGENT-PACKS §4, AP-4).

Four sub-scopes, four blocks below, and the load-bearing tests are the ones that prove a
REFUSAL or a NON-action rather than a happy path:

* ``test_round_trip_on_a_fresh_home_lands_the_trigger_disabled`` — an imported trigger arriving
  ENABLED would start doing work nobody asked for, so the assertion reads the PERSISTED bytes.
* ``test_broken_roster_slug_blocks_the_import_naming_the_ref`` — a broken slug must block, and
  the message must name the exact unresolved ref (a "roster invalid" refusal is useless).
* ``test_only_the_always_tier_deploys`` — proves the ``phase-N`` member is NOT deployed by the
  one-click button, which is the whole point of a staged roster.
* ``test_pasted_card_is_fenced_before_the_model_sees_it`` — the card reaches the model as
  attributed untrusted DATA; asserted through ``security.is_fenced``, never a substring.
* ``test_tampered_resource_refuses_before_any_pclaw_exists`` — one-link's per-resource hash.

Every test binds ``GIDEON_HOME`` to a tmp dir (the robust lever — stores and SEL read it
live), and the round-trip tests use TWO homes so "it imported" can never be an artifact of the
home it was exported from.
