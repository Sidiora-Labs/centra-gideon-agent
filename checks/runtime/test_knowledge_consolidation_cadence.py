"""The consolidation cadence: do the two config knobs actually reach the gate?

Before KL-14's consolidation clause, `knowledge.consolidate_min_hours` and
`knowledge.consolidate_min_cluster` round-tripped fully (dataclass + `_meta` + `load()` +
the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist) and had **no reader anywhere**. The provider gated
itself on `consolidation.MIN_HOURS_BETWEEN_PASSES` / `MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE` — module constants
whose values happen to equal the config defaults, which is exactly why nothing looked wrong.
A user could widen the floor in Settings and the next pass ran on the constant.

So every assertion here goes through the provider or the pass and observes the OUTCOME. None
of them read the config back: reading back a value you just wrote proves the round-trip, which
was never broken, and would have passed before the fix.

**No test here makes a model call.** The model seam is `_apply` / `_write_summary`, reached
only when `action_config` carries `apply: true` AND a non-empty `summaries` list. Every call
below either omits `apply` (the provider's documented DRY-RUN default) or goes through
`run_consolidation_pass`, which passes `{}`. `test_pass_never_reaches_the_model_seam` pins
that shut by making `_apply` raise if anything ever calls it.
