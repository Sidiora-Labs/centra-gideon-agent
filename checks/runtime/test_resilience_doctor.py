"""Doctor framework doctrine + probe tests (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §1).

The doctrine (§1.3) is the whole point of the tier ladder, so it is pinned here as
executable invariants:

* a tier-3 capability failure degrades ONLY that capability — never ``core_ok``,
  never ``restart_suggested`` (§1.3.1);
* a tier-2 (cheap-RPC) failure short-circuits the tier-3 packs and IS the only
  failure that suggests a restart;
* a probe that raises becomes an ``ok=False`` row, never a 500 (the AUTO-R15
  framework invariant);
* secrets are masked out of ``detail``/``evidence`` before they leave a probe.

Success-criterion #1 (gateway healthy, a capability dead → core OK, that
capability failed at tier 3, no restart) is asserted directly.
