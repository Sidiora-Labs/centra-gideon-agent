"""The `trigger_source` provider seam (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE AUTO-A4).

Four things this proves, one per DONE_WHEN clause, and every one is DRIVEN rather than asserted
against hand-built state:

1. A fixture app's declared source fires an `event` trigger end to end — through the real
   `trigger_sources.emit` → `event_triggers.emit_event` → `matches` → `execute_event_action` path —
   with a fenced, provenanced payload, and the frozen capability fence honoured.
2. Disabling the app parks its bound triggers with a typed reason from `autopause`'s vocabulary, and
   the park actually STOPS the fire (a park that did not would be an inert control).
3. `trigger_source` is in `PROVIDER_TYPES` AND has a registered handler (the #47 rule).
4. No vendor names anywhere: the fixture app is `sample-source`.

🔴 The state hazard this suite avoids. The `trigger_sources` registry is process-global, exactly like
`_DUTY_GATES` and the action-provider registry, so every test that registers MUST restore — under
xdist a leaked source would make an unrelated test's `emit` succeed (or park a trigger it never
created). The `_source` fixture owns that teardown; nothing here registers by hand.
