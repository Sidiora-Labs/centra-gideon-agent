"""The `run_completed` chain runtime — "when X finishes, run Y" (§7 item 8 — S122).

🔴 THE DEFECT. `run_completed` was a declared kind with no firing path. It is in `KINDS`, `SPEC_KEYS`
accepts `{source_trigger, source_def}`, the store persists it, `/api/triggers` lists it and the
Automations page renders it. Nothing ever fired one. Measured with a real `clock:nightly` and a
`run_completed:after` pointed at it:

    clock tick considered: ['clock:nightly']    # the source fires
    file poller:           []
    web poller:            []
    → run_completed:after is reached by NOTHING

So "when my nightly backup finishes, notify me" was creatable, listed, and permanently silent.

**This is the THIRD kind found in this state** — `file` (S93), `web_watch` (S121), and now this.
Three instances is a pattern, not a coincidence, so this file also carries the completeness test
that makes it checkable: every kind in `KINDS` must have a runtime or a documented reason.
