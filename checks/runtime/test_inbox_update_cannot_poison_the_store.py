"""A wrong-typed field cannot poison the inbox store (issue 338).

`PUT /api/inbox/{id}` took the body's values on trust. Measured by driving the real handlers
against a temp home — four distinct defects, in the order the handler hit them:

    PUT {"draft": {"a": 1}}       -> TypeError 500 … and the value was ALREADY SAVED
      GET /api/inbox             -> TypeError 500, permanently, surviving restart
    PUT {"confidence": 123}      -> 200. Accepted silently. A wrong type with no symptom.
    PUT "notadict"               -> AttributeError 500 (`body.get` on a str)
    PUT {"status":"dismissed"} to a NONEXISTENT id
                                 -> 404 … with the id already persisted into
                                    `inbox_state.dismissed` and an engagement signal recorded

The corruption is unrecoverable by design, not by accident: `store.update` reached
`self.save()` inside the same loop that did the `setattr`, so the bad value was on disk before
the exception left the function. `redact_item` — the ONE redaction pass every reader runs — then
regexes `draft`, so a single poisoned item took out `GET /api/inbox` and `GET /api/inbox/pending`
whole (a list comprehension over every item), not just its own row.

The pre-404 pollution is the sharper finding. Three blocks ran before the item was known to
exist, and each decided independently whether it does: `mute_thread` guarded with `if item:`,
`favorited` passed `None` into `_record_signal`, and `dismiss` did neither. So this is not a
missing guard — it is three copies of a decision that belongs in one place.

`isinstance` is load-bearing over `type(v) is`: all four string fields are legitimately written
with `str`-subclassing enum MEMBERS by this package's own callers (`handlers_inbox:428` passes
`ItemStatus.DISMISSED` itself, not `.value`), so an exact-type check would refuse the
codebase's own writes. Pinned below.

ARCC was queried first (persisted user data is an explicit trigger domain). SAX-04 Outcome 3
names *"validating input after processing rather than before"* as a pitfall and requires
sanitizing **before storage** with type/format validation and logged failures — which is
exactly the ordering fix. (Outcome 5's state-consistency material is DynamoDB/Step Functions
machinery and does not apply to a local JSON store; noted, not stretched.)
