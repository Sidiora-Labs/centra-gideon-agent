"""KL-13 — the similarity-edge pass's HOST REGISTRATION.

The clause under test: *"the edge pass runs on the KL-14 maintenance host, never inline on the
write path."* That is two claims, and each fails in its own silent way, so each is asserted
separately here:

* **It runs on the host.** Not "a name is in a dict" — a registered name proves a dict entry and
  nothing about reachability. Every positive assertion below drives `maintenance.execute()` and
  measures what the registered callable actually invoked, with the host's batch size read off the
  call rather than assumed.
* **It is RESUMABLE, not a sweep.** `batched=True` is the substance of this registration, not a
  detail. `similarity_pass` returns items PROCESSED, so the value is remaining work and the
  host's sub-batch loop is what drains the library. Marked `batched=False` the pass would still
  import, still register and still look wired while draining exactly ONE batch per tick — a
  library larger than a batch would never converge, and nothing in `MaintenanceResult` would
  say so. :func:`test_the_similarity_pass_DRAINS_across_sub_batches` is the assertion that flips
  red on that mistake; the flag check alone would not.
* **It never runs inline.** Asserted at the write path with a counting stand-in installed: N
  real `create_typed_item` calls must invoke it ZERO times and leave a watermark, and one host
  run must then invoke it exactly once. A stamp file cannot express that half — a watermark that
  coalesces perfectly and a store that also did the work inline leave identical state, and only
  the call count separates them.

**The stand-in, stated plainly.** `knowledge/similarity_edges.py` is a sibling atom's file and
is NOT on this branch; creating it here would collide at assembly. So every assertion that needs
a callable installs a stand-in module (see :func:`_install_pass`). That makes the HOST WIRING —
registration, the `batched` contract, the drain loop, the batch-size pass-through, the write-path
negative — genuinely tested, and leaves the pass's own behaviour untested here (it belongs to the
pass's suite). :func:`test_the_real_similarity_module_satisfies_the_registered_contract` is the
seam that closes at assembly: it skips loudly while the module is absent and binds the moment it
lands, so a signature mismatch fails in this suite rather than at the first live tick.
