"""Criterion 7: kill the gateway mid-fire and restart — the boot sweep that had no caller (S142).

Criterion 7: *"Kill the gateway mid-fire and restart: no double-fire, no lost fire, missed slots
appear in the review card, pending approvals re-arm, `catch_up` triggers fire exactly once,
staggered."*

🔴 **THE DEFECT — five dead layers, the deepest chain this program has found.** The dead-seam sweep
(the technique from S141, generalised) flagged four functions in the criterion-7 chain with no
caller outside their own module. Following each one up found the criterion inert end to end:

1. **`service.boot` had ZERO callers.** Boot ran `migrate_and_arm`, which only arms rows with NO
   `next_fire_at` (`arm.needs_arming`) — so a trigger that WAS armed and went overdue while the lid
   was shut kept its stale past fire, and the first tick found it due. Measured on ten minutely
   triggers overdue by an hour: **10 of 10 due in the same instant at boot**, the restart stampede
   `boot_recovery`'s deterministic per-id stagger exists to prevent (108-179s apart, when called).
2. **`review_at_boot` and `catch_up_plan` read four keys nothing produces.** `last_fire_at`,
   `interval_secs`, `missed_last_slot`, `fires_automatically` — `Trigger.to_dict()` emits **none of
   them**. So even when called, the review was EMPTY however long the lid had been shut, and every
   trigger answered "nothing was missed".
3. **`drain_spooled_fires` had no caller.** A fire parked by a sync CLI memory write sat on disk
   forever — the silent drop the spool was written to fix, one layer up.
4. **`wakeup.retry_queue` had no caller.** A resume whose session was not ready was built,
   classified `REQUEUED`, and thrown away. §3.2 refuses to let anyone drop one: it carries a gate
   answer, and eating it strands the parked run forever waiting for a reply the user already gave.
5. **The loop's own drop check read a key its producer does not emit.** `summary.get("dropped")` —
   `summary()` returns `{total, delivered, by_disposition, retry}`, so a `no_session` delivery (a
   fire that reached nobody) was logged nowhere.

Three of those five are the same shape: a live reader asking for a name its producer never writes.
That is worse than an unread constant, because the silence reads as "nothing wrong".

**And two bugs the wiring itself exposed**, both latent only because nothing called `plan_boot`:
the review was snapshot AFTER recovery had already overwritten the evidence, and `missed_dropped`
re-armed a 03:00 backup to 09:02 — firing off-schedule the very slot it had decided to drop.
