"""Regression: concurrent sparse worktree creation must not lose the cone.

``add_worktrees`` fans ``sparse-checkout set`` out through a thread pool; the
first such call in a repo writes ``extensions.worktreeConfig`` into the SHARED
``.git/config``, so concurrent arming raced on the config lockfile and the
losers silently fell back to FULL hydration (measured: ``could not lock config
file … File exists`` → ``docs/guide.md`` present in a src-scoped worktree).
Fix is two-layered: the batch pre-arms the shared write while still serial,
and ``set_sparse_scope`` retries the one transient lock error class.
