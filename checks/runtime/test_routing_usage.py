"""MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY MRT-3 — the usage/spend fold (``routing/usage.py``).

The load-bearing test here is :func:`test_fold_matches_hand_computed_fixture`: 50 recorded lines
whose expected fold is written out BY HAND (not recomputed by the code under test), so an arithmetic
or bucketing change has to break an assertion rather than agree with itself.

The second load-bearing one is :func:`test_a_guarded_attempt_is_censused_never_summed`. The atom as
written folded ``model_calls.jsonl``; that record structurally excludes interactive chat, and a
union with the turn ledger double-counts a loop (its inner inference is recorded in both, and the
two rows share no id to dedupe on). So the fold sums the ledger and CENSUSES the audit, and that
test is what stops a future change from quietly summing them.
