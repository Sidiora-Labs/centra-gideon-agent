"""ACP-AGENT-PARITY §2.6 gap 10 (atom ``AAP-9``) — an ACP save stamps its Project.

The defect, precisely: ``artifact_save`` stamps ``project_id=_current_project_id()``, which
read ONLY the native runtime's per-turn contextvar. An ACP CLI's tools run in a separate
``gideon mcp-core`` process where that contextvar is empty by construction — and
``provider_bridge`` pops ``project_id`` unconditionally, handing it to the native builder
alone, so nothing about the binding crosses into the ACP branch either. Every ACP save
therefore filed an artifact with no project and it never appeared on its Project page.

The fix resolves the binding SERVER-SIDE from the session key, which already crosses to
that process. Three properties are worth more than the happy path and are pinned here:

* the native path must never reach the HTTP fallback — it runs INSIDE the gateway, so a
  blocking self-request is at best wasted and at worst unservable;
* an unscoped session must stamp "" and never a default project (filing work under a
  project the user never chose is worse than an unstamped artifact);
* the endpoint keys off ``X-Session-Key`` and never off a caller-supplied name, so it
  cannot be turned into a cross-session read of someone else's binding.
