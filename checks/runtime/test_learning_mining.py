"""The §3.2 PRODUCERS — embeddings, intent inversion, positive-path traces (WF2LEA-7).

`learning.detectors` holds pure verdicts fed from outside, and three of its inputs had no producer
at all. That is the failure shape this suite prevents recurring: a detector that is
written, tested, reachable, and permanently returning its "nothing to see" branch because the
argument it needs is never computed.

What is pinned here, in the order the defects would reappear:

* the producer returns REAL ``(run_id, cosine, age_days)`` triples from the real
  ``SemanticArchive``, and ``similarity_verdict`` reaches its AUTO_FILE branch on them — the
  branch that could not fire before;
* a registry MISS is a typed, recorded reason and never an empty list read as "no repetition" —
  every miss variant, because a blind detector that looks calibrated is the specific harm;
* the run's OWN spec is excluded from its own matches (a plan is maximally similar to itself, so
  counting it would let one run clear ``min_priors`` alone);
* intent inversion synthesizes a user-register sentence from execution, and reports drift;
* a positive trace is order-sensitive, gated on COMPLETE runs and on min_frequency, and files a
  PENDING proposal — never an install;
* the wiring itself: `run_end.capture` calls these producers on a real terminal run.

Every test drives the REAL store/ledger/proposal path under a tmp `GIDEON_HOME` — the stores
bind `config_dir` at import, so the env var is the isolation that actually holds.
