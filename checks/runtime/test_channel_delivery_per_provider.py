"""Every channel's outbound reply goes to that channel (issue 959).

`channel_delivery` was a single handle held in TWO places — `RuntimeCoordinator._channel_delivery`
and `ConsoleState.channel_delivery` — and every shipped transport wrote both at `start_inbound`.
So with Discord, Slack and Telegram connected, the last registration won. Measured on
`origin/main` by executing the real registration path:

    for name in ("discord", "slack", "telegram"):   # apps load alphabetically
        orch.register_channel_delivery(FakeDelivery(name))
    orch._channel_delivery  ->  <telegramDelivery>

A Discord message is then received correctly, the agent runs, and the answer is handed to
`TelegramDelivery` along with a Discord channel id — so the reply is lost, deterministically, for
every provider except the alphabetically-last one.

The root cause is a missing routing key, and it was missing on both sides: the 18-method
`ChannelDelivery` protocol has no provider member, and the session→channel link is
`(thread_ts, channel_id)` with no provider — yet a channel id means nothing without one.
`deliver_text("C123", …)` is answerable only by the provider that issued `C123`. Meanwhile the
INBOUND door already takes the provider explicitly (`deliver_channel_inbound(provider, msg)`),
from the same caller at the same lifecycle point. That asymmetry is the bug.

Two resolution policies, because the call sites ask two different questions — a partition measured
from the 25 sites, not invented:

* `delivery_for(provider)` — a REPLY carries the origin channel's id, so exactly one provider can
  deliver it, and None means DO NOT SEND (`chat_runner`'s three mirror sites);
* `owner_reachable()` — a cron result, heartbeat summary, approval prompt or subagent reply is
  addressed to the OWNER via `open_dm(owner_id)` and has no origin channel (every `gateway.py`
  site).

ARCC was queried for this work (message routing / tenant isolation). It returned SAX-05 AWS
multi-tenant material with no requirement applicable to a local single-user app — noted. Its
principle does name the shape: a shared slot with no keying is an absent isolation boundary, and a
reply reaching the wrong channel is a confidentiality question, not only a delivery one.
