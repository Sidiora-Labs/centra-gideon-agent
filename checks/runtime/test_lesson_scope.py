"""WF2LEA-14: a workspace-scoped lesson is STORED workspace-scoped, and stays put.

The defect these tests pin: `mcp_memory.memory_remember` advertised
``scope: global|workspace`` and enforced that a workspace name accompany
``scope='workspace'`` — then POSTed both fields to ``/api/lessons``, where
``api_lessons_create`` read only ``rule``/``category``/``negative``. Neither
``memory_service.write_lesson`` nor ``vector_memory.write_lesson`` had a scope
parameter at all, so the record landed at the ``MemoryRecord`` default (global) and
``MemoryScope.WORKSPACE`` sat in the inert-surface baseline. A caller that carefully
asked for a workspace-scoped lesson silently got a global one and was told "ok".

What is asserted here, end to end through the real handler:

* a workspace lesson persists ``scope='workspace'`` + ``scope_ref=<realpath>`` and
  reads back that way from a FRESH store over the same db file;
* it is NOT visible to another workspace, and NOT visible to a reader with no
  workspace identity — including through the real ``build_session_context``;
* a global lesson is still visible to everyone (existing lessons keep behaving);
* the three refusals: missing workspace, non-absolute workspace, unknown scope —
  each a 400, never a silent downgrade to global;
* every ``MemoryScope`` member is mapped, with no default branch that could turn a
  future member into "global".

All state is under ``tmp_path``; the real ``~/.gideon`` is never touched.
