"""The `council` template's shape contract: independent fan-out, attributed fan-in.

`tests/test_workflows_bundled.py` already holds every bundled template to the library-wide
bar (it validates, it lints clean, its inputs are documented, its action nodes name
registered providers). None of that can tell whether a *council* is still a council, and
the two ways this template rots are both invisible to a validator:

* **The fan-out stops being independent.** Reshape the `parallel` into a `sequence`, or let
  one member's prompt bind another member's output, and the run still validates and still
  produces an answer — an answer three members converged on because they read each other.
  Three correlated reads presented as three independent ones is worse than one read, because
  the agreement looks like evidence.
* **The fan-in starts selecting instead of synthesizing.** Point the terminal binding at one
  member's output (which is exactly what `best-of-n` correctly does) and the template becomes
  a slower, more expensive best-of-N wearing a council's name. The attribution is the whole
  product: a decision the reader cannot trace back to the role that argued for it is one they
  cannot argue with.

So the properties asserted here are the ones the shape is FOR, read off the real
`workflows/bundled/council/workflow.json` rather than a fixture. Every detector also gets a
vacuity floor against `best-of-n` — the closest sibling and the one template that must FAIL
the attribution contract — because a detector that matched everything would satisfy each leg
below while proving nothing.
