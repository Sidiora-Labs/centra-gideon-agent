"""S69 — the injection screen, the frozen capability set, and zero-silent-drop ledger rows (§4a/§7).

§7's acceptance criteria are the only two in this plan that say **"adversarially verified"**, so
this suite is built as an attack corpus rather than a set of examples. Two independent criteria:

* an inbox item containing prompt-injection text **cannot steer** an unattended digest run, and
* it **cannot cause any action outside the trigger's frozen capability set**.

The second matters precisely because the first will eventually fail: a regex screen is a filter, not
a proof. `test_a_screen_evasion_still_cannot_act_outside_the_fence` is the one that encodes that.

**Measured before any of this was written.** `vector_memory._INJECTION_PATTERNS` — the repo's only
screen, private to memory writes — caught **5 of 18** payloads across the plan's six OWASP groups
(0 of 3 on token smuggling, jailbreak, and indirect injection) while tripping on **2 of 3 ordinary
sentences**. Wrong in both directions, which is why this is a new screen and not a reuse.

Both directions are asserted here, and the false-positive corpus is not decoration: a screen that
blocks "summarize the system prompt design doc" gets turned off by its users, and a disabled control
protects nothing.
