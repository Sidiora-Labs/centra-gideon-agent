"""Rung routing at the dispatch seams (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §5.2, atom AG-7).

AG-6 shipped the ladder with NO call sites — a decision object nothing consulted. The two
properties this atom is defined by are:

1. an app-contributed action inherits its DECLARED floor/ceiling with no dispatch-layer
   special-casing;
2. a ``leaves_machine`` type cannot resolve ``autonomous`` without an explicit ceiling
   raise.

**Everything here is driven through a REAL dispatch.** ``execute_event_action`` and
``run_script_hook`` are the production fire paths; the app declaration arrives through
``ActionTypeHandler.register``, the same handler the app loader calls on enable. A test that
constructed a spec and called ``resolve_rung`` by hand would prove the decision layer works
and say nothing about whether anything consults it — which is the exact defect AG-6 left and
this atom exists to close. The source-level check at the bottom is an ADDITION to that, not
a substitute: it fails when a FOURTH dispatch seam appears without routing, which no
behavioural test can notice.
