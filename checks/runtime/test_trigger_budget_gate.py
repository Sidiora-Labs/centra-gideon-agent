"""The budget gate, actually supplied — and `max_fires` enforced (§3.6 / crit 8 — S133).

🔴 THE DEFECT. `firepath`'s budget gate reads `ctx.budget_remaining`, and `service.tick` **never set
it**. So `if ctx.budget_remaining is not None` was always False and the budget gate had never
refused
a real fire. Third instance of this exact shape — S97's `existing_claim`, S116's `requested`, this —
which is why the fix ships with a test that drives `tick`, not `evaluate`.

The user-visible cost was `gates.max_fires`: declared in `GATE_KEYS`, validated, carried by
`LEGACY_FIELD_MAP`, and bounding nothing. Measured, with the claim released each tick so the overlap
gate could not mask the question:

    max_fires=2   →  8 fires over 8 slots
    no gates      →  8 fires over 8 slots       (identical: the cap did nothing)

A second inert piece underneath: **nothing incremented `run_count`** on this path, so even a wired
budget would have compared against a permanent zero. A cap needs a meter.
