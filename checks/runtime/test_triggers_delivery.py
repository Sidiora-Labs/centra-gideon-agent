"""The outbound delivery contract (AUTO §7 criterion 10 / R18 — S85).

Criterion 10: "A completed-run notification deep-links (statusUrl) to the exact run journal row; a
retried delivery does not double-ping."

**Measured before writing.** A grep for `statusUrl` or `status_url` across `runtime/gideon`
returned nothing — the deep link the criterion names did not exist anywhere in the package. A
completed-run notification carried a title and a body, so a user reading "Nightly digest
finished" had no route to the run that produced it. R18 calls that "the notification→journal
dead end".

The two load-bearing tests are the criterion's own two clauses:
`test_the_status_url_points_at_the_exact_run` and `test_a_retried_delivery_does_not_double_ping`.
