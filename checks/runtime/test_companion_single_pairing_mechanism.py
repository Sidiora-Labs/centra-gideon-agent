"""One device-pairing mechanism, and no platform-specific code in the shared surfaces (`CA-9`).

COMPANION-APPS Success Criterion 1 and its S4 T4.2/T4.3 rows assert two properties of the
*repository*, not of the prose that claims them:

* **no parallel device-token code** — MOBILE-COMPANION's own device-token/QR design was folded
  into COMPANION-APPS §C1/§C2 by `CA-3`, and the fold cost nothing because the rival design was
  never built. A doc saying "there is no second mechanism" is not evidence; the moment someone
  adds a `device_token` route, store or claim, every one of those sentences becomes a lie and
  nothing goes red. These censuses are what makes it go red.
* **no speculative per-platform code shipped** — the future-platform recipe in
  ``docs/guides/companion-apps.md`` says a new platform wraps the served UI and implements the
  client contract, gated on PLATFORM-REACH. The failure mode it guards against is a well-meant
  stub: a native SDK import or a reserved branch landing in the surfaces every platform shares,
  ahead of any shell that uses it. That is dead code that reads as a promise.

**What is NOT a violation here.** A sanctioned native shell landing as its own tree with its own
build once PLATFORM-REACH clears the platform is the recipe working, not a regression — which is
why the platform census is scoped to ``runtime/gideon`` and ``apps/console/src`` (the shared halves) and
deliberately says nothing about a shell directory. ``apps/desktop/`` is likewise out of scope: an
Electron shell is DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES' to branch on host OS as it needs.
``gideon.security.auth.enrollment`` is out of scope too — it is a documented deliberate sibling of
``auth.pairing`` with its own store file and its own surface, not a second device-pairing path.

Every census here carries a **vacuity floor**. A pattern that matches nothing looks clean while
proving nothing, so each test asserts its scanner found a subject before it asserts what the
subject is.
