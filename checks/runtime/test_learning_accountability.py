"""S77 — predict-then-verify, auto-filed reverts, the incognito gate (LEARN-R16 / §7).

The last spoke: everything upstream FILES proposals, and this measures what happened after a human
accepted one. §3.1's rule is predict-then-verify rather than measure-after — an accepted proposal
declared which failures it would fix, so the verdict compares prediction against outcome instead of
looking at a delta and inventing a story.

**Measured before writing.** `refiner.canary_verdict` (S73) already returns the five verdicts from
a scalar, so this reuses that vocabulary rather than forking it. And `learning/gate.py`'s permission
half is genuinely CLOSED — probed across all three cadences, a restricted session is refused
whatever its tool count or correction signal. What is NOT closed is COVERAGE:
`test_the_uncovered_cadences_are_pinned` records that `SESSION_END` and `RUN_END` are declared with
zero
live callers, because a gate cannot suppress a path nobody routes through it.
