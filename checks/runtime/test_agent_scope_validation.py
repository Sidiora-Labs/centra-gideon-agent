"""`agent_scope` — declared, persisted, and enforcing nothing (§1.4 decision 2 — S131).

Decision 2's recon note: *"chat-turn hooks fire agent-scoped (`fire_for_ids` over
`AgentProfile.triggers`); the substrate **preserves agent scoping as an optional
`spec.agent_scope`**
and does not silently introduce a global chat firing path."*

🔴 THE DEFECT. `agent_scope` is in `SPEC_KEYS["event"]`, round-trips through the store, and was
validated by **nothing**. Every one of these stored with `ok: True` and zero issues:

    agent_scope="not-a-list"        # a bare string
    agent_scope=[]                  # an empty list
    agent_scope=[123]               # non-string entries
    agent_scope=["nonexistent"]     # an agent that does not exist

And no fire path reads it. A field that accepts any shape and is read by nothing does not *preserve*
scoping — it **promises** it, which is worse than its absence: an author who sets it believes their
trigger is fenced to one agent.

**The legacy path is genuinely fine**, verified rather than assumed: `chat_runner._fire`
resolves the
session agent's own trigger ids per fire and calls `fire_for_ids`, whose resolver returns `[]`
on any
failure precisely so a broken lookup cannot fall back to global firing. The substrate has not
introduced a global chat firing path — the store-backed `event` kind fires on DATA events (memory
writes, and after EIAT-1 inbox arrivals), never on chat turns. So this session validates the field
and makes its unenforced state visible, rather than inventing a scoping mechanism for events that do
not exist yet.

    🔴 AUTO-A4 is the interesting case for this guard, because an APP could plausibly contribute a
    chat-turn-shaped source. It cannot reach the scope: `trigger_sources.emit` namespaces every app
    event under `app:<name>:<event>` and emits with `source=SOURCE_APP`, so an app naming its event
    `chat_turn` still arrives as an `app` event and matches only `AppEvent` triggers. A chat-turn
    SOURCE — a new `EVENT_SOURCES` member — is what would break the pin, which is exactly right.
