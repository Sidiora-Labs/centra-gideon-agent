"""PCS-7 — the prompt-cache tallies must stay ONE store, provably.

The atom's done_when says the per-turn aggregate reuses ``stats.py``'s counters "with
no second store". Three rails already ship, and none of them can see a second store
appear:

* ``test_stats_counters_still_carry_both_cache_keys`` checks the two counters are
  PRESENT on the singleton. Its docstring claims it reds "if a refactor adds a
  parallel per-turn store" — it does not. A new accumulator in another module leaves
  ``Stats().snapshot()`` and ``hasattr(Stats, "inc_cache_*")`` untouched.
* ``test_cache_hit_pct_is_module_level_and_stateless`` pins only that the derived
  helper did not become a ``Stats`` method.
* ``TestCallSiteRail`` pins that the call site CALLS the shared helpers. Calling them
  and also keeping a private accumulator are not mutually exclusive.

So "no second store" was, until this file, an invariant held by a hand-run census
recorded in the plan's execution log. Anything a human counted once, a later change
un-counts silently. This is the executable version: over
``src/gideon/**/*.py``, by AST rather than by grep (a docstring naming
``cache_read_tokens`` is not a store), (1) nothing ACCUMULATES a prompt-cache-named
quantity, (2) the only writers of the tally are ``Stats.inc_cache_*`` and they are
called from exactly one module, (3) the two per-turn locals that feed the telemetry
are ASSIGNED from the terminal event, never accumulated across events, and (4) the
singleton grew no cache-named attribute beside its one counter dict.

Half (1)'s expected result is the EMPTY set, which is the shape that passes when a
scanner matches nothing at all. It therefore carries a positive control: the same
scanner is re-run over a source string that does accumulate, and MUST flag it.
