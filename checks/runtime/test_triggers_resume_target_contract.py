"""WF2AUT-14 ratification ratchet: the resume-target contract SHAPE is pinned.

See `the wf2aut14-resume-target-contract plan (internal, not in this repo)`. Behavioural pins (a
real run driven to a real gate and resumed, the missing-target dispositions, idempotence)
live in ``test_triggers_resume_target.py``; this file is the cement the atom adds — it pins
the *shape* of the contract WF2LOO-9 and every future consumer read against:

* the public authored key,
* the exact authored field set (``node_id`` deliberately absent — descoped),
* the exact normalized-output key set.

A change to any of these is a change to the contract, so it must be a deliberate edit to a
RED test (and to the design note), never a silent drift.
