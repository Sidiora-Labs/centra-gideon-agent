"""Context lifecycle for long-horizon nodes (Slice 10b, WF2-R6).

The templates this engine ships — `deep-research`, `audit-sweep` — are exactly the shapes where
compaction alone demonstrably fails. Compaction keeps the WHAT and drops the WHY, so a compacted
loop re-litigates settled decisions, re-reads files it already verified, and reports confident
conclusions built on summaries of summaries.

Three mechanisms, each closing a different hole:

* **handoffs** — an iteration writes where it got to; the next STARTS from that rather than from a
  compacted transcript. Denser and more honest, because it was written by the iteration that did
  the work while it still remembered;
* **carryover buckets** — typed, bounded, deduped facts that survive any reset. Prose degrades
  under summarization ("I checked the auth module" loses the line numbers); structure does not;
* **decision records** — `{choice, reason, rejected, constraints}`. The rejected alternatives are
  load-bearing: without them a resumed run re-proposes the option already dismissed.

Everything is journaled, which is what makes rewind and resume replay it instead of reconstructing
a summary — and everything is bounded, because an unbounded bucket is a transcript with extra steps
and would reintroduce the context exhaustion it exists to prevent.
