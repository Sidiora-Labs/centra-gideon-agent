"""The confirmation-gate emission call site (TASKS-SOPS §4 — S61i).

S57 built the `ConfirmationRequest` record and its verbs; S61e gave the events a channel.
Neither was
emitted by a running gate — a run could park on an approval and the ledger would show
`workflow_needs_input` and nothing typed, so "how long did this gate wait" and "who answered it" had
no answer in the run's own history.

Both halves now fire from the controller, and the placement is the whole design:

* **PENDING rides `_ensure_continuation`**, which already dedups on `(path, epoch)`. The watchdog
  polls a waiting run repeatedly; a second emission site would put one "awaiting approval" row per
  poll into the ledger for a single question. Measured below: a re-poll leaves the count at 1.
* **RESOLVED fires AFTER the claim is won and the epoch checked.** Emitting earlier would log an
  approval for a race the caller LOST, and the audit would show two people approving one gate.

The id is derived from `(run, gate, epoch)` via the shipped `confirmation.request_id`,
never from the
resume token: a token is single-use and rotates, so a token-derived id would give the two halves
different values and they would never pair up.
