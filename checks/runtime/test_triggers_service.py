"""`TriggerService`'s tick — §3 / §3.1 (S88).

§3: "One asyncio loop — the existing single re-armed `_arm_timer` task generalized … computes the
earliest `next_fire_at` … sleeps until it (capped at 30s for external-edit pickup via mtime
`_sync`),
coalescing same-second firings."

**Buildable because S87 shipped the store.** S83/S86 recorded "the store and the service are one
unbuilt foundation"; that was half wrong — the service needs the store, not the reverse. Every
dependency was verified importable before this file existed.

**The boundary this file defends:** §3.2 says "the scheduler never executes directly".
`tick()` returns
the fires that passed every gate; a WakeupDispatcher runs them. A service that both decided
and executed
would make crash-safety untestable, since §3.2's safety comes from the payload surviving in an
inbox.

Every test drives a REAL `TriggerStore` on `tmp_path`. The type-seam defect this session found
(`next_fire_at` is `str` on the entity, `float` in `scheduling`) is invisible to a mocked store.
