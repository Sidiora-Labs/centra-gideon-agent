"""The empty-state suggestion list has to work in the empty state.

`_FALLBACK_SUGGESTIONS` is shown in exactly one situation: `generate_suggestions` found no
substantive context — no memory, no sessions, no automations — or the LLM was unavailable. It is
also what `SuggestionsCache` seeds from before the first generation. So it is the brand-new-install
list, on `#/chat`, which is the most-visited surface in the product.

Two of its six entries asked about state that state does not have:

    "Summarize my recent conversations"   there are none; that is WHY the fallback fired
    "Review my latest PR"                 assumes a repository context nobody has configured

A suggestion chip whose best possible answer is "you don't have any" spends a first impression to
say nothing.

🪤 THIS RAIL PINS THE CRITERION, NOT THE STRINGS. An exact-list assertion would red on every
re-wording and teach the next person to update the expected list without thinking — the same
failure mode that let two stale hint counts survive in `apps/console/src/ui/forms.tsx`. What is asserted
here is the property that made the old entries wrong: **no fallback suggestion may refer to prior
user state**. Copy can change freely; only a dead end coming back reds the gate.
