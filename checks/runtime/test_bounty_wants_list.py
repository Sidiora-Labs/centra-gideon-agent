"""The app bounty wants-list is executable, not prose (ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING ET-7 input).

``docs/maintainers/app-bounty-wants-list.md`` is the single list two plans consume:
``ET-7`` files one ``bounty`` issue per row, and ``CE-9`` files the three channel rows.
A wants-list is exactly the kind of doc that rots silently — it names provider types,
scaffold commands and file paths, and every one of those can go stale while the table
still *reads* fine. A contributor who picks up a rotted bounty burns an evening
discovering core cannot install what the issue asked for.

So the four things a bounty issue would carry over into the public are asserted here:

1. **Every row's type is a real ``PROVIDER_TYPES`` member.** A row naming a type core
   does not have sends a contributor to build an uninstallable app.
2. **Every row's type actually scaffolds.** The list's central promise is "there is no
   registration step to wait on" — asserted by resolving each type through the real
   ``cli_app_new`` type table, the same table ``gideon app new --list-types``
   prints.
3. **At least six rows, spanning all three families.** ``ET-7``'s ``done_when`` bar is
   "≥6 ``bounty`` issues (channels + providers + sources)"; a list that silently fell
   to five, or lost a family, would fail that atom at posting time rather than here.
4. **The three channel rows agree with the drafted issue prose** in
   ``community-bounty-drafts.md``. Those two files are the list and the issue text for
   the same three bounties; if they disagree, one of them is lying.

Cited in-tree paths are checked too — the docs-lint ratchet catches a dead *link*, but
these are the paths a contributor is told to read.

# the gap that let a row rot

Every check above validates a row's SHAPE. Not one of them ever asked whether the row's
claimed GAP still exists — so the file carried a suite that made it look executable
while a justification went false underneath. It happened: the ``trigger_source`` row
correctly measured 0/4 adoption across the first-party channel apps, ``CE-10`` drove
that to 4/4 hours after this list merged, and every test here stayed green while the
list went on publicly soliciting work that was already built and tested.

Core CI has no checkout of ``GideonApps``, so it cannot re-count the apps repo,
and a comment asking a future reader to re-measure is the failure, not the fix. What IS
enforceable from here is the *vintage* of each claim and the *core half* of it:

5. **Every measured-gap row carries a well-formed ``measured <ISO date> @ <apps ref>``
   stamp**, and a row that is NOT a measured gap carries none. An undated gap claim can
   no longer reach the public list at all.
6. **Every row stamp agrees with the one population stamp** in the doc's admission
   criteria, so a half-done re-measure — header bumped, rows left behind, or the reverse
   — reds instead of passing quietly. Re-measuring the table is all-or-nothing.
7. **The core-side premise of each measured gap is RE-MEASURED every run.** Rows 4-6
   rest on facts about core's own registries ("exactly one builtin gate, ``manual``";
   "``native`` is the only registered memory provider"; nothing surfaced as
   ``kind:external``). Those live in this repo, so they are read off the real registries
   rather than trusted — in a clean subprocess, because the registries are
   process-global and a sibling test that registers without restoring must not be able
   to turn this rail red or green by accident.

Checks 5-7 do not make the apps-side count self-verifying; nothing in core can. They
make it DATED, INTERNALLY CONSISTENT, and false-for-a-reason instead of silently false.
