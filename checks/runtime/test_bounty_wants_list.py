"""The app bounty wants-list is executable, not prose (ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING ET-7 input).

``docs/maintainers/app-bounty-wants-list.md`` is the single list two plans consume:
``ET-7`` files one ``bounty`` issue per row, and ``CE-9`` files the three channel rows.
A wants-list is exactly the kind of doc that rots silently — it names provider types,
scaffold commands and file paths, and every one of those can go stale while the table
still *reads* fine. A contributor who picks up a rotted bounty burns an evening
discovering core cannot install what the issue asked for.

So the four things a bounty issue would carry over into the public are asserted here:

1. **Every row's type is a real ``PROVIDER_TYPES`` member.** A row naming a type core
   does not have sends a contributor to build an uninstallable app.
2. **Every row's type actually scaffolds.** The list's central promise is "there is no
   registration step to wait on" — asserted by resolving each type through the real
   ``cli_app_new`` type table, the same table ``gideon app new --list-types``
   prints.
3. **At least six rows, spanning all three families.** ``ET-7``'s ``done_when`` bar is
   "≥6 ``bounty`` issues (channels + providers + sources)"; a list that silently fell
   to five, or lost a family, would fail that atom at posting time rather than here.
4. **The three channel rows agree with the drafted issue prose** in
   ``community-bounty-drafts.md``. Those two files are the list and the issue text for
   the same three bounties; if they disagree, one of them is lying.

Cited in-tree paths are checked too — the docs-lint ratchet catches a dead *link*, but
these are the paths a contributor is told to read.
