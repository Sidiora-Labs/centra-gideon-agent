"""AAP-5 §2.2: the host-authority permission mode must reach the CLI in the CLI's
OWN vocabulary, and a refusal must never be silent.

Both halves of this file guard a measured live failure, not a hypothetical:

1. **Vocabulary.** ``permission_authority.HOST_AUTHORITY_MODE`` is ``"default"`` —
   claude-code's spelling. codex-acp's ``configId="mode"`` options are
   ``read-only`` / ``agent`` / ``agent-full-access`` (read off a live ``session/new``
   snapshot). Forwarding ``"default"`` verbatim got ``-32602 Invalid params`` on every
   codex session, which left codex on its own ``agent`` mode — "Read and edit files,
   and run commands", i.e. exactly the CLI-is-its-own-authority state §2.2 exists to
   leave. Measured A/B on one live prompt ("write a file in the workspace"): with the
   untranslated mode the write reported ``ungated`` and executed; with ``read-only``
   the same write raised ``session/request_permission`` and parked on the host gate.

2. **Silence.** ``AcpConnection.send_request`` registers the pending future and
   returns WITHOUT awaiting; every ``session/set_*`` site discarded it, so the
   ``-32602`` was read by nobody. A refused permission mode that logs nothing is
   worse than one that fails loudly, because the audit trail says "mode forwarded".
