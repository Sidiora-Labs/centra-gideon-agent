"""S70 — quiet windows, the duty-gate seam, the week grid, and `automation doctor` (AUTO-A1/A2).

`gates.quiet_hours` has been a RESERVED key with no semantics since S62: declared in `GATE_KEYS`,
accepted by validation, consulted by nothing. So the first test here is the one that matters most —
`test_wrap_semantics_match_the_shipped_notification_matcher`.
`providers/entity_routes._in_quiet_window`
already answers "is 23:00 inside 22:00→08:00" for notifications, and two different answers to that
question on one machine would be a bug nobody could explain.

What the shipped matcher CANNOT express, measured: no day-of-week, one window per call, server-local
minutes with no timezone, and a bare bool with no catch-up-or-skip resolution. That gap is this
session's scope, and the wrap semantics are preserved verbatim across it.
