"""The keystone out-of-band enable for desktop computer use (`DCU-1`, §3 floor 1).

Five groups, one per clause of the done_when — plus one group that exists entirely because
of a hazard in the atom itself.

1. **Fail closed in every direction** — absent, unreadable, non-JSON, wrong root type,
   unknown version, unknown key, and an ``enabled`` that is not the literal ``true`` all
   resolve to OFF. A parse error must never read as enabled.
2. **The refusal** — a WHAT/WHY/FIX naming the out-of-band enable step, raised (never a
   falsy return, never a simulated success), proven through a fixture tool that calls the
   real guard.
3. **No flip surface** — not in ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG``, no route/CLI/config field names it,
   the agent-reachable path checks refuse it, and the process's own module never writes it.
4. **The reachability ratchet, and its vacuity** — ⚠️ *the population of computer-use tools
   is EMPTY today.* `DCU-4` ships the tool surface, the stdio shim and the in-gateway
   dispatch chain; `DCU-3` ships the macOS driver. So a test that literally iterated "every
   computer-use tool" would pass over nothing. This group therefore (a) states the
   population size out loud so the emptiness can never be silent, (b) proves the ratchet's
   scanner actually FLAGS an entry point that skips the guard, using a synthetic module, and
   (c) runs the ratchet over the real package, where it is armed-but-unexercised until
   `DCU-4`. Group 2's fixture tool is the same function the scanner is proven on, so the
   refusal proof and the ratchet proof are about one object rather than two.
5. **Boot audit** — the resolved source + digest + outcome reach the SEL, and the gateway's
   run loop calls the boot hook.
