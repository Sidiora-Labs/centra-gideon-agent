"""Tests for consolidation and the maintenance provider tier (KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §3.4/§4.4).

The consolidation pass is the most dangerous thing in the knowledge subsystem: it runs
unattended, it rewrites the store, and every one of its failure modes is quiet. A pass that
clusters nothing still reports success. A pass that archives a user's own note reports success
too. So the tests that matter here are the ones that check a control has an EFFECT, not that it
exists.
