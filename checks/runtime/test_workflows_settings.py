"""The four config knobs, and the wiring that keeps them from being inert (TASKS-SOPS §8 — S61k).

§8 names four `WorkflowsConfig` fields and the four points each must pass through: dataclass +
`_meta`, `AppConfig.load()` mapping, `to_dict()`, and the PATCH allowlist. All four are wired here.

**The part that actually matters is the fifth point nobody writes down.** `materialize`,
`confirmation` and `pool` each carry their own module constant, so a field can be set, persisted,
echoed by `to_dict` and rendered in Settings while the runtime goes on using 20 / 7 days / 900s.
That is the present-and-inert control this program keeps finding, and it is what these tests pin:
knob is read through `workflows.settings`, and the call sites are asserted to resolve from config.

**A stale plan premise, measured.** §8's recon says `workflows.match_threshold` already exists.
It does not — `WorkflowsConfig`'s own docstring records that it was DELETED with the old SOP feature
under the namespace-reuse clean break, and a repo-wide grep finds it only in that docstring. It is
deliberately NOT re-added: the new semantic channel is session-59 scope and its threshold is not
user-tunable yet, so a knob nothing reads would be the exact defect this file exists to prevent.
