"""Tests for the ``demo-home`` seed fixture (DL-4).

``tests/test_seed.py`` covers the seeding *mechanism* (rails, audit, CLI wiring)
against the ``empty`` fixture. This file covers the ``demo-home`` fixture's
*content*: that the hand-authored records actually load through the production
stores, and that every file in the fixture tree is declared as package data so
the wheel carries it.

Two failure modes drive the shape of these tests:

1. **Silent record loss.** Both entity readers swallow every exception
   (``hierarchy._read_project``, ``native._read_task`` are
   ``except Exception: return None``), so a trailing comma in a fixture file
   makes that record vanish with no error and no log line. Asserting "the file
   exists" would still pass. Every assertion below therefore goes through the
   real store and asserts on the loaded record.

2. **Silent packaging loss.** The package-data glob was ``tests_fixtures/*/*``
   — exactly one level deep — so every file the fixture keeps in a subdirectory
   (``projects/<id>/project.json``, ``workspace/memory/history/*.md``) was
   excluded from the wheel. A source checkout looked perfect and only a real
   ``pip install`` would have shown the fixture half-missing.
