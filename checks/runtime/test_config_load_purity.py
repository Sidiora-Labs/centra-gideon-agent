"""``AppConfig.load()`` must be a PURE READ, and the migration must still run at boot.

The defect. ``load()`` used to back ``config.json`` aside with ``shutil.copy2`` and call
``cfg.save()`` inline whenever the parsed config needed migrating. So *any* caller that
merely read config rewrote the user's file and dropped a ``.bak`` beside it — including a
module that resolves config into a module-level constant at import time, which on this
repo's CI happened during pytest **collection**::

    import gideon.integrations.mcp_artifacts
      → mcp_core.py:111   _API = _resolve_api_base()   # module level
        → mcp_core.py:106 cfg = AppConfig.load()
          → the migration write-back → the REAL ~/.gideon/config.json

Three things made it maximally hard to catch, and each one shapes a test below.

* **No fixture can reach it.** It ran in the ``importtestmodule`` path, before a single
  fixture exists. So the purity rail is a SUBPROCESS test: the import must be that
  interpreter's first (``sys.modules`` makes a re-import a no-op) and the property must
  hold with no conftest in play. That also makes it deterministic instead of dependent on
  which xdist worker imported what first — which is exactly how it hid.
* **It is invisible on a developer machine.** The write only fires when ``config.json``
  exists AND is pre-migration; a developer's own config is already migrated, so
  ``needs_migration`` is False and nothing is written however broken the code is. Every
  test here therefore seeds a genuinely pre-migration config. One that seeded an
  already-migrated config would have passed throughout the defect's life.
* **It under-reported.** ``copy2`` preserves the source mtime, so the ``.bak`` looked
  older than the run and the real-home rail named only ONE of the two changed entries.
  ``checks/runtime/test_real_home_guard.py`` owns that half.

The pairing is the point. "``load()`` writes nothing" is trivially satisfiable by deleting
the migration, which would silently strand every existing config. So the purity rails here
are worth nothing without :func:`test_the_gateway_boot_path_persists_the_migration` and
:func:`test_load_still_applies_the_migration_in_memory` beside them. Ship both or neither.
