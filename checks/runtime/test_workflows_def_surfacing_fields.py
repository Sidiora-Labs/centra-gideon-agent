"""The def-side surfacing fields and the def→record adapter (TASKS-SOPS §2 — S61).

S58-S60 built the surfacing records as pure decision modules. `WorkflowDef` had none of the fields
they read — measured against `dataclasses.fields`, there was no `surface_mode`, `cadence_days`,
`escalation`, `packs`, `hands_off_to` or `guided` anywhere on the def. So every one of those
mechanisms was reachable only by a caller that hand-built a record, which is another way of saying
none of them could be driven by an authored template.

This session adds them to `DefMetadata` — the TYPED metadata block, not `extra` — for the reason
that block's own comment records: `from_dict` drops what it does not name, and annotating all 18
bundled templates with `keywords` once left the matcher reading 0/18 while the authors believed the
field was set. A field in an open dict is a field the reader treats as absent.

The adapter is ONE conversion point per record type. Two readers of the same fields drift, and the
drift shows as a def that surfaces through one path and not the other for identical metadata.
