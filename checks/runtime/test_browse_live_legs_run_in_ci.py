"""BA-2's behavioural clauses must be proven ON THE MERGE GATE, not on whoever's laptop.

``GIDEON_REQUIRE_BROWSE_PROOF`` (``checks/runtime/browse_chrome.py``) already turns a missing
browser from a skip into a failure. That lever protects nothing on its own: **nothing in the
repo set it**, and the ``test`` job installs no browser, so on the machine that gates every
merge the behavioural layer skipped. Measured on a browser-less tree: **20 skipped**, spread
over ``test_browse_safety_script.py`` (10), ``test_browse_cdp_live.py`` (9) and — the part that
made it invisible — ``test_browse_behavioural_proof_is_reachable.py``'s own load-bearing case
(1). A skipped surface reads exactly like a pass, so the green check said "the safety script
blocks ``fetch()``" while having never opened a browser.

``ci.yml``'s ``browse-live`` job closes that: it installs a Chromium and sets the require-env,
so a browser that is missing, renamed by a Playwright bump, or unlaunchable is a RED there
instead of twenty quiet skips. This file is the rail over that WIRING, because the wiring is
now the load-bearing part — delete the env line, or drop a module from the pytest invocation,
and the proof silently stops running again with nothing to say so.

Deliberately derived, not pinned by name:

* **The leg is found by what it does**, not by its job id — "the job that runs pytest on the
  browse-proof modules". A rename stays green; deleting the job does not.
* **The module list comes from the source.** Every ``checks/runtime/test_*.py`` that imports
  ``browse_chrome`` can skip on a missing browser, so every one of them must be named on the
  leg. A new ``test_browse_..._live.py`` that nobody adds to ``ci.yml`` would otherwise skip
  forever, which is the one-sided-inventory failure this repo keeps meeting.
* **Every path the leg names must exist.** A typo'd or renamed path is the ``[0 items]`` trap:
  pytest can report a clean exit having collected nothing, and the count is the only tell. Here
  it is a red at lint-speed, before CI.

Parsed with a line scan rather than PyYAML, which is not a test dependency (same convention as
``test_ci_tier_enforcement.py`` and ``test_e2e_specs_are_executed.py``). Every helper takes its
text as an argument so the vacuity tests at the bottom can drive the SAME functions with
synthetic workflows and watch each answer change.
