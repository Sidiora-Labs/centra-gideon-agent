"""A gateway secret does NOT reach a hook, cron-script or bash-action child (PHF-4).

🔴 WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE THE FIX. A real gateway process carried **121** environment
variables — almost all of them inherited from the launching shell (terminal, toolbox,
agent-CLI and cloud-SDK variables) — and `config/loader.py:4008` deliberately seeds `.env`
credentials into `os.environ` "so spawned children (sandboxed agents, MCP servers,
cron-fired subprocesses) inherit them". Against that population the three spawn sites had:

* **cron scripts** — a denylist of exactly ONE prefix (`GIDEON_SECRET`). Every other
  variable, credentials included, was readable by a user script via `os.environ`.
* **bash hooks / bash actions** — a name-PATTERN denylist (`_KEEP_NAMES` +
  `_SECRET_NAME_PATTERNS`), which keeps everything it does not recognise. Its own comment
  conceded the false negatives ("`MY_GITHUB_PAT` is kept").

Both are now built by ALLOWLIST (`sandbox.build_child_env`). These tests plant a
credential-shaped variable in the gateway's own environment and drive each site's REAL
child, asserting from the child's own view of `os.environ` that the secret never arrives.

Each site also carries a non-vacuity assertion: the child still receives PATH. A test that
only proves absence would pass just as well against a child that received nothing at all,
or never ran.
