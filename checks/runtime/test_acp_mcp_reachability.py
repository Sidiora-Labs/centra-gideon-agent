"""AAP-4 — ``gideon-core`` is reachable from an ACP session.

ACP-AGENT-PARITY §2.1, "the biggest single unlock". Phase 1 measured the same
three NOs on all three providers — ``knowledge_search`` NO, ``task_create`` NO,
``notify`` NO, no ``gideon-core`` server (`O4`, `C4`, `K4`) — because every
live ``session/new`` sent ``"mcpServers": []``.

**Prong A is the whole mechanism.** All three ``session/new``/``session/load``
sites and the pooled (concurrent) path carry the ``gideon-core`` spec, with
the session inject-back (``GIDEON_SESSION_KEY`` + ``GIDEON_HOME``)
declared in its env.

**Prong B — config seeding for a CLI that ignores the protocol field — is
deleted** (`AAP-4` DEVIATION 2): no such CLI exists, nothing ever supplied the
argument that reached it, and it was kiro-shaped by construction. The rails at the
bottom of this file are that deletion's regression floor.

The one record that reads like a contradiction, resolved: `K6` found that kiro
never *discovers* the ``$GIDEON_HOME/agents/gideon.json`` the host
writes, because its only roots are ``<cwd>/.kiro/agents`` and ``~/.kiro/agents``.
That is a fact about a **config file path** and it was prong B's motivation — not
evidence that kiro ignores the protocol array, which is a separate channel and
measured live (`K54`, `K100`). A config kiro cannot see and a protocol array kiro
honours are both true, so the deletion removes no kiro mechanism.

Plus the `G31` home-isolation break: the generated agent config's bash-audit hook
named the operator's REAL ``~/.gideon/audit.log`` with a literal tilde.
