"""ES-11's budgeted optimize-harness search (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE §8).

The criterion this file answers has five clauses, and four of them are the kind that reads as
satisfied while being quietly false, so each is railed with its own negative:

* **"nothing live mutates during the search"** is proven by OBSERVATION, not by asserting
  intent. Every end-to-end test hashes the live artifact tree itself — with this file's own
  ``_digest`` helper, deliberately not the module's :class:`LiveWitness`, so a broken witness
  cannot certify itself — before and after a real search. Two negatives make the observation
  non-vacuous: a scorer that mutates the live file raises, and a proposer that writes the live
  file and restores identical bytes is still caught (by the mtime/size snapshot, which is why
  there are two detectors rather than one).
* **the DUAL gate** gets one test per half, each holding the other half satisfied, plus a tie
  case. A gate whose halves are only ever observed together could be admitting on one.
* **the frozen region** is asserted to REFUSE rather than record: the violating candidate is
  scored higher than everything else in its search and still is not the winner.
* **the three halts** each get a firing test and a non-firing counterpart, so none of them is
  a condition that would fire on any input.
* **the winner is a PROPOSAL**: the only filing path is ``refiner_tools.file_template_diff``,
  and nothing in this module can apply a template.

The last group is the call-site half: the bundled template's ``bash`` nodes name subcommands
and ``PC_OPT_*`` env keys, and those names are asserted against the module's own tables. The
decisive question for those — would deleting the caller be caught — is yes in both directions:
renaming a subcommand fails the template's test, and dropping the template's env key fails the
coverage test.
