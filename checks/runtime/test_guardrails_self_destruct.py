"""A scheduled action can no longer kill the gateway running it (WF2AUT-14).

🔴 THE DEFECT, measured before a line was written. The packaged baseline denylist
(`security.baseline_denied_command_patterns`) is the only thing that had ever looked at this, and
it looks at LITERAL TEXT. Counted against it:

* `gideon stop` — no pattern. `gideon update` — no pattern. `gideon service
  uninstall` — no pattern. Each one ends the host process; each one passed.
* `.*personal.?claw restart.*` does exist, and `PC=gideon; $PC restart` walks straight
  past it, as does `gideon   restart` (two spaces) and `$(which gideon) restart`.

And the hazard is reachable, not theoretical: a clock trigger's `bash` action reaches
`BashActionProvider.execute`, which runs `/bin/sh -c command` and screens nothing itself, while
`gideon restart`/`stop` are SERVICE-FIRST (`cli_server._restart` calls
`service_controller.restart_service()` first) — so they bounce the installed service, i.e. the
process hosting the run. The fire's `ScheduleRunStore` row never reaches a terminal state, and
what the user sees afterwards is a hung run, not a self-inflicted stop.

Two things this file is careful about, because both are ways a guard like this goes wrong:

* **Over-refusal is an outage.** `systemctl restart nginx`, `docker restart my-redis`,
  `gideon status`, `gideon cron update nightly` and a log line that merely mentions
  the word must all still run. Asserted, not assumed.
* **A literal-text screen is the bypass class.** So the evasion shapes are named individually
  and driven individually — a respelled absolute path, a shell variable, a `cd` first, and an
  extra argument appended to an otherwise-innocent command.

Distinctness from WF2AUT-9 (`skip_if_active`) is asserted too, by outcome: that guard admits the
fire this one refuses.
