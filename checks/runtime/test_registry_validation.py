"""ET-3 — the registry data tier staged under ``scratch/registry/``.

The three clauses the listing policy lives or dies on are the first three tests:

1. a valid listing PASSES,
2. a ``dangerous`` scanner verdict BLOCKS the listing and the rule that fired is
   recorded,
3. a ``warning`` verdict LISTS WITH DISPLAY and blocks nothing.

Clause 3 is the one that is easy to get backwards, so it is asserted from both
directions: the row is listable AND its blocking list is empty AND the finding is
present in ``display``. Inverting the rule in ``verdict_reasons`` reds it.

**These tests are offline, and they run the real fetcher.** ``validate_registry``
reaches a repository exactly one way — ``git ls-remote`` for liveness and ``git clone
--depth 1`` to fetch — and git treats ``file://`` and ``https://`` the same. So each
test builds a throwaway git repository out of a committed fixture app tree and points
a listing row at its ``file://`` URL. No fetch is stubbed and no check is skipped;
the only difference from production is the scheme, which is why the scheme itself is
gated (``test_a_file_url_is_refused_unless_the_test_flag_is_passed``).

Every negative rail carries a vacuity assertion — the placeholder really was there,
the LICENSE really did exist before it was deleted — because a rail that silently
stops matching reads exactly like a rail that passes.
