"""The scanner-rule gloss has ONE home, and it survives packaging (#2633).

``gideon skills install`` refused a skill and printed one bare row per finding —
``- [high] python_exec in scripts/fetch.py: subprocess.run([...])`` — then stopped at
eight with nothing said. Two defects on the one output whose entire job is to justify a
refusal: the row names the scanner's pattern but never says what the skill could DO, and a
ninth finding vanished silently.

The gloss already existed, in TypeScript (``web/src/lib/scanFindings.ts``), and the CLI is
Python. Duplicating the map in Python is the defect #2535 removed — two literals for one
fact, which drift — and reading the TS at runtime cannot work, because the wheel ships
``web/dist``, not ``web/src``. So the map moved to a language-neutral
``gideon/scan_rule_gloss.json``: the CLI reads it at RUNTIME, the Vite build imports
it at BUILD time, one literal for every consumer.

🔴 THE RISK THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. A new non-``.py`` file is NOT shipped in a wheel by
default. If the packaging declaration is ever dropped, or the file arrives empty, the gloss
disappears — and disappearing quietly is precisely the failure mode the map was written to
prevent ("the failure mode here is silence, and silence is what the user reads as 'probably
fine'"). So a repo-tree check is NOT evidence here: ``test_the_gloss_ships_inside_a_built_wheel``
builds a real wheel and reads the bytes back out of the artifact, and
``test_a_reachable_but_empty_map_is_a_hard_error`` covers the other direction, where the
file is present but its contents are gone.
