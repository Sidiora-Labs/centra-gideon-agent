"""EA-5 (EXTERNAL-ACCESS §8) — telemetry import for unproxyable agents.

**Fixture provenance, stated plainly:** the log shapes below are asserted from
the *adapters' declared contract* — the fields each adapter documents that it
reads — and NOT from a real captured file. No Claude Code session transcript,
OpenAI request log, or SSE dump exists anywhere in this repo to fixture from
(``git grep -ln "session.jsonl"`` finds only unrelated dashboard/history tests),
so a fixture claiming to be a real capture would be a guess wearing a test's
clothes. What these tests therefore prove is the normalisation contract — a §7.2
record with every key present, malformed input skipped and counted, idempotence
by content hash — and *not* that a given vendor's exporter emits exactly these
keys. If a real export ever disagrees, the adapter is what changes; these
assertions about the record shape stay.

Every test runs against ``tmp_path`` as ``GIDEON_HOME`` so the import
ledger is written under the temp home and never the operator's real
``~/.gideon``.

``stage_records`` (the sibling ``capture_store``, which owns redact → fence →
persist) is INJECTED as a double throughout. That is deliberate: this half owns
parsing and idempotence, and a suite that reached for the real store would be
testing hygiene this module is specifically not allowed to own.
