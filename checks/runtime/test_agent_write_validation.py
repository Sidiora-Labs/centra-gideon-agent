"""An agent write validates its SHAPES before it validates nothing (#349).

`POST /api/agents` / `PUT /api/agents/{name}` validated the NAME well (regex, length,
traversal, duplicate → 409) and the three LIST fields with `isinstance(..., list)` — and
handed every other value straight to the dataclass. Three consequences, all reproduced by
executing the real handlers against an isolated home:

======  ==========================================  ================================================
#349 A  a ~1200-deep JSON value                     raw 500 (`RecursionError` inside `cfg.save()`)
#349 B  a wrong-typed scalar on any of 13 fields    200, and the wrong type PERSISTS in config.json
#349 C  a retired/reserved agent name               200 `ok:true` for an agent that then isn't there
======  ==========================================  ================================================

**What the whole-class sweep added to the report.** Three findings the issue does not name:

* the same 500 reproduces through a LIST field (`tools: [<2000-deep>]`), so a scalars-only
  guard would not have closed A — the depth bound has to sit where every field passes;
* `PATCH /api/agents/detail/{name}` has the identical gap on the file-backed runtime config
  the ACP agent reads at boot (`{"description": 12345}` persisted an int; `{"tools":
  [{"a":1},5]}` persisted objects into a list of server names; a deep value 500'd) — one
  function away from the list-field guard #427 already installed there;
* C's reserved half was live too, not merely its retired half: on a config with no `agents`
  map yet, `POST {"name": "gideon-lite", "system_prompt": …}` answered 200, and
  because the seeding migration is add-if-MISSING it never overwrote the impostor — so the
  background chore worker ran the caller's prompt, and PUT/DELETE then answered 403 because
  the name is reserved. The ABSENCE of a seeded profile was the protection, not a guard.

**No second validator.** The rules are `config/edit_spec.py`'s `coerce_edit_value` — the
one the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH path, `PUT /api/config/gideon` and `gideon
config set` all share. This change contributes a spec TABLE (`_AGENT_FIELD_SPECS`) for the
agent profile and one shared entry point (`_staged_agent_fields`), so the create path, the
update path and the file-backed PATCH path cannot disagree about what a field is.
