"""LV-5 — the S3 refinement arm: stumble detector → refine proposal → diff → versioned accept.

The arm is a CLASSIFIER in front of the existing proposal queue, so the negatives are tested as
hard as the positives: every "fires on" case below has a paired "and does not fire when …" that
differs in exactly one input. Two of those pairs are the ones that matter most —

* an **environment failure** never produces a refinement (a flaky network must not harden into
  procedure), and
* a turn with **no skill loaded** never produces one (there is nothing to refine, and a target
  invented from the candidate index would name a skill that had no part in the turn).

The diff is not asserted to "look like a diff": ``test_diff_is_exactly_what_accept_applies``
accepts the proposal for real and asserts the resulting skill body equals the diff's own after
side, so the previewed patch and the applied patch cannot drift.
