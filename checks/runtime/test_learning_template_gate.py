"""The ad-hoc→template gate at its CALL SITE (LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.2, WF2LEA-7).

``detectors.gate`` shipped with zero production callers: the chain decided nothing, and its typed
``Skip`` reasons — the counts §3.2 says "are what say which gate earns its keep" — had no writer.
The load-bearing tests here are the two that would have caught that:
``test_the_ladder_fifth_branch_reaches_the_gate`` (a real turn reaches the chain) and
``test_every_negative_decision_writes_a_typed_row`` (every refusal leaves a row).

Everything else pins the two properties that make the wiring safe: an accepted candidate is FILED,
never installed, and a recording failure can never break the path that files it.
