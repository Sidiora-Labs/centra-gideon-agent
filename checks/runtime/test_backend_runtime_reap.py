"""App-backend process-leak fix: boot-time orphan reaping by path identity.

The gateway spawns app backends on enable. A fresh gateway (empty in-memory
table, auto-ports) can't reclaim a prior gateway's backends by port, and if the
prior gateway died ungracefully (crash / ``kill -9`` / the double-signal
force-exit path) it orphaned them (reparented to init) — repeated hard-kills pile
up MANY orphans per app. The reliable, self-healing signal is the OS process
table: on boot, reap every live process whose command line runs THIS app's exact
entry path AND whose parent is dead (PPID 1). The parent-alive guard is load-
bearing: a process whose parent still lives belongs to a live supervisor — a
concurrently-running gateway or a test process — and reaping it kills a working
backend out from under that supervisor (the exact incident this guards against:
a pytest run's supervisor SIGTERMing the real gateway's live backends).
