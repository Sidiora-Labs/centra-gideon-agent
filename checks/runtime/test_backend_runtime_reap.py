"""App-backend process-leak fix: boot-time orphan reaping by path identity.

The gateway spawns app backends on enable. A fresh gateway (empty in-memory
table, auto-ports) can't reclaim a prior gateway's backends by port, and if the
prior gateway died ungracefully (crash / ``kill -9`` / the double-signal
force-exit path) it orphaned them (reparented to init) — repeated hard-kills pile
up MANY orphans per app. The reliable, self-healing signal is the OS process
table: on boot, reap every live process whose command line runs THIS app's exact
entry path AND whose parent is dead (PPID 1). The parent-alive guard is load-
bearing: a process whose parent still lives belongs to a live supervisor — a
concurrently-running gateway or a test process — and reaping it kills a working
backend out from under that supervisor (the exact incident this guards against:
a pytest run's supervisor SIGTERMing the real gateway's live backends).

    **Each orphan is confirmed reparented BEFORE the next is spawned.** Spawning all four
    and then waiting for four races four independent reparentings against one clock: on a
    loaded CI runner three land and the fourth is still pointing at its intermediate shell,
    so `reap_orphans` correctly skips it and the count comes up short. Raising the timeout
    (this test was already moved 20s → 60s once) only makes that window less likely — it
    does not remove the race, and a test that passes because the machine was fast is not
    testing anything. Serializing the waits removes it: N sequential single-process waits
    have no interleaving to lose.

    **The assertion is DEATH, not the return count.** Measured on CI (PR #196, one job of two):
    serialized waits confirmed all four pids reparented, and `reap_orphans` still returned 3.
    The return value is derived from a SECOND `ps` snapshot taken inside `reap_orphans`, and
    `_pids_running` is documented as best-effort and conservative — a snapshot on a loaded
    runner can legitimately miss a live process, so the count is inherently lossy. What the
    behaviour under test actually promises is that the whole pile ENDS UP DEAD, and that is
    observable per-pid without depending on how many rows one `ps` happened to return. So the
    count is asserted loosely (it reaped a pile, not one) and `_wait_all_dead` — which polls
    each pid individually — carries the real assertion.
