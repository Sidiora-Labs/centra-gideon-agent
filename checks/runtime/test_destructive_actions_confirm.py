"""A destructive mutation states its intent before it runs (#606, #604).

Two routes destroyed state on a bare POST while a SIBLING in the same file already gated:

* ``POST /api/knowledge/tags/{id}/merge`` rewrites every item carrying the source tag and then
  DELETES that tag from the taxonomy — strictly more than ``delete_tag``, whose UI prompt spells
  out its blast radius four lines away in ``TagManager.tsx``. ``merge_items``, in the very same
  handler module, already requires ``confirm: true`` and says why.
* ``POST /api/task-lists/{list_id}/reset`` is the only path that empties ``execution_notes`` —
  the record of what was actually done on each task — and its control is a bare icon button.

The second half of #606 is a different defect in the same route: merging a nonexistent tag
answered ``200 {"ok": true, "moved": 0, "already": 0}``, because the store returned that dict for
a missing tag. That is byte-identical to a legitimate merge of a tag carrying no items, so
"absent" was indistinguishable from "zero" — a success shape that could mean "your subject does
not exist".

`TestNoNewUngatedDestructiveRoute` is the part that stops the class coming back: the two fixes
above are point fixes, and nothing about them prevents the next destructive verb shipping bare.
