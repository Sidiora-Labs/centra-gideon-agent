"""The pending-outcome resolver — a decision's bet is graded once its horizon elapses (WF2LEA-4).

LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 (LEARN-R18). A decision-producing run journals a `pending_outcome` at
DECISION time — the subject it decided, the `metric` that will reveal whether it was right, the
`horizon_secs` after which that metric is meaningful, the `baseline` to beat. This module is the
other half: a one-shot on the curator tick that, for every open question whose horizon has passed,
measures ground truth from semantic memory, scores it against the baseline, journals an
`outcome_resolved` (closing the question), and files a graded lesson PROPOSAL.

The clauses WF2LEA-4's `done_when` names, each driven against the REAL `MemoryService`/
`VectorMemoryStore`, the REAL Run Ledger (`Journal` over `store`), and the REAL proposal store
(monkeypatched to a tmp home):

* INERT unless a memory service with a live vector store is injected — with no store there is
  nothing to measure;
* a question still INSIDE its horizon is left pending (not resolved early);
* past the horizon with a readable metric → resolved + a graded proposal citing the measured
  figure vs baseline, tagged `measured`;
* past the horizon with an UNreadable metric → inconclusive (an honest "could not tell", not a
  fabricated pass), tagged `inconclusive`;
* IDEMPOTENT — a second tick reads the `outcome_resolved` that cites the question's
  `pending_event_id` and skips it, filing nothing new;
* the graded lesson is a PROPOSAL, never a live lesson (propose-don't-install), and it is
  actually FILED (the `min_evidence=1` regression guard — the floor default of 3 would silently
  skip every once-per-decision outcome).
