"""Arming the clock — spec → next fire, and the two storms it prevents (§3.1 — S96).

**🔴 THE BLOCKER THESE TESTS PIN.** Measured before writing a line, against a REAL migrated store:

    store.migrate_from_crons()   # lossless: true, enabled: true
    SVC.boot(store, ...)         # {'rearmed': [], 'total': 1}
    # next_fire_at after boot:   '(none)'   → due_ids() == []  forever

A migrated cron was **permanently inert**: it reported migrated-and-enabled and could never fire,
because `due_ids` only surfaces triggers that HAVE a `next_fire_at` and nothing computed a FIRST
one. `scheduling.recompute_from_completion` handled intervals only; `boot_recovery` needs an
existing fire (handed 0.0 it returns 0.0); `next_after_completion` returned 0.0 for every
non-interval kind on the premise that a "recurrence engine" owned them — and no such engine
existed. That is the real reason the clock cutover could not proceed.

Fixing the first half exposed a second, worse one: a cron that fired kept `next_fire_at` at its
ELAPSED slot, so every later tick read it as still-due — a **fire storm on one past slot**, not
merely an inert row. Both directions are pinned here.

Semantics are inherited from the shipped `schedule.compute_next_run_ts`, not invented: a cron is
evaluated in the trigger's OWN timezone, and an elapsed one-shot never re-arms.

    A skip date is a promise about a calendar day, so when the offset would break it the fire keeps
