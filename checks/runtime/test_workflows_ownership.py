"""Tests for run session ownership and incognito inheritance (WORK-CONTAINERS §5.1, S50).

The property this module exists for: **a run launched from an incognito chat must not write memories
from its stages.** That failure is invisible — the chat itself stays clean, so the user has no
signal
that the mode was defeated.

Two seams had to learn the `workflow:` prefix, and both were verified by calling the real functions
rather than by adding a parallel helper:

* `sel._infer_source` — without it, every run-owned tool call audits as `channel`, the catch-all
where
  unrecognized keys silently land. "What did the run do" becomes unanswerable from the audit log
  even
  though every event is in it.
* `context._prompt_use_case_for` — without it, an owned session resolves to the `chat` prompt,
framing
  a stage worker as a conversational assistant.

The asymmetry: an unrecognized `memory_mode` value parses as INCOGNITO, not NORMAL. The value exists
because someone asked for privacy, and a typo or a newer mode name this build does not know must not
read as "record everything". A lost note is recoverable; a memory the user believed was never
written
is not.
