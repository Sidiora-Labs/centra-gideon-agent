"""A timeout that waits for the grandchild is not a timeout (PEP-9 / DC-4 defect class).

``asyncio``'s ``Process.wait()`` resolves when every *inherited pipe* has disconnected,
not when the child is reaped. So the pair

    proc.kill()             # signals the direct child only
    await proc.communicate()  # unbounded

waits for whatever grandchild still holds the inherited stdout/stderr — i.e. for the
grandchild's full runtime, wearing the timeout's name. Measured over a ``sleep 30``
grandchild with a 1s timeout: **30.02s**; with the child leading its own group and the
GROUP signalled, **1.01s**.

Two independent things are pinned here:

* :func:`test_run_verify_command_kills_the_grandchild_within_the_bound` drives the real
  call site (``loop.gates.run_verify_command``) against a real forking shell and asserts
  both halves of the deliverable — it returns under the bound AND the grandchild is gone.
* :func:`test_control_the_replaced_shape_blows_the_same_bound` is the **vacuity proof**:
  the shape the fix replaced, measured against the same grandchild and the same bound,
  must exceed it. Without this the bound could be a number the fix meets trivially.

The census rail below is likewise bidirectional: the leaf spawns must NOT acquire the
flag, so a future blanket sweep reds this file. Signalling a group you do not lead takes
the gateway down with the child, which is worse than signalling one pid.

**Where the kill lives changed (req.3).** Every deadline now goes through
``gideon.core.cancellation.run_with_timeout`` / ``wait_with_timeout``, the ONE owner of a
blown process deadline — it group-signals only when the child leads a group, escalates
SIGTERM→SIGKILL, reaps within a bound and closes the pipes. So the kill-style census
below asks "is this deadline OWNER-routed?", not "does this except-handler call kill?",
and a bare ``proc.kill()`` in a timeout handler is now the drift it reports. The
``start_new_session`` census is unchanged and still does the group-vs-leaf work:
owner-routing a leaf is safe, giving a leaf its own session is the blanket sweep.
