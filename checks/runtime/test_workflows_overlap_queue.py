"""`on_overlap` — three policies, and the queue `queue` never had (WV-14).

`OverlapPolicy.QUEUE` shipped as the exact OPPOSITE of its name. The run-workflow provider
compared against `SKIP` (return early) and `CANCEL_PREVIOUS` (cancel, then start) and let
`queue` fall through to `store.create` + `_launch` — so the policy whose name promises
ORDERING started a second run beside the still-running first one, silently, which is the
precise hazard `OverlapPolicy.SKIP`'s own comment says the default exists to prevent.

The load-bearing assertions here are the ones a "QUEUE exists" test could never make:

* **three policies, three DIFFERENT observables** for the same busy def — nothing created,
  one run created and NOT started, and the prior cancelled with a new run started;
* **a hand-made DRAFT is never launched by the drain.** `RunStatus.DRAFT` is also where a
  user's deliberately-unstarted editor draft lives, so a drain keyed on "DRAFT for this
  def" would start work the user never asked for. Queued-ness is a marker, and this is the
  test that pins it;
* **the drain runs on the real path** — a real controller reaching its real terminal write
  launches the queued run, and a fresh watchdog's poll does the same after a restart;
* **the exhaustiveness ratchet** — every member of the closed enum has its own branch in
  `overlap.decide`, proven by driving each member AND by reading the branches out of the
  source, with a raising tail so a fourth member cannot inherit a neighbour's behaviour.
