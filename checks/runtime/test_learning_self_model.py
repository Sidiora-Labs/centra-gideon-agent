"""S72 — the capped self-model: reinforcement-promoted, propose-don't-write (LEARN-R21 / §2.6).

The flywheel's ONLY mechanism that learns from what quietly WORKS. Every other cadence learns from
corrections and failures, so this is the one that can notice a habit that keeps succeeding — and
that asymmetry is what makes it worth constraining. §2.6 names three constraints and this suite
asserts each is enforced MECHANICALLY rather than by convention:

* propose, never install — `test_a_refused_plan_yields_no_proposal_at_all`
* bounded by construction — `test_a_full_tier_displaces_rather_than_appending`
* only a compact snapshot injects — `test_the_snapshot_is_bounded_and_drops_whole_entries`

**Measured before writing.** `user.selfmodel.*` was NOT in `vector_memory._NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE`, so
a behavioural principle the harness observed about its OWN working patterns would have rendered as a
FACT ABOUT THE USER. `test_the_selfmodel_prefix_is_excluded_from_fact_blocks` is the regression.
`user.*` WAS already in `_BUILTIN_PREFIXES`, so no allowlist change was needed — measuring both is
what kept this session from inventing one.
