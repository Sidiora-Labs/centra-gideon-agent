"""EA-7 — the channel sender-trust read/revoke API (`handlers/channel_trust.py`).

The trust store shipped writable from two places (a pairing code, the unknown-sender
notification's Allow) and readable from none, so "who can talk to my agent right now?" had
no answer short of reading JSON out of the home directory. These are the two routes that
close that, plus the rails for the two ways this particular surface can go quietly wrong:
leaking the pairing secret into the read projection, and being shadowed by the neighbouring
`/api/channels/{name}` route.
