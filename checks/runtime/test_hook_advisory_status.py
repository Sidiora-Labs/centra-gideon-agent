"""A hook's exit-2 block is recorded as `blocked` only where it was HONORED (G89).

🔴 **The measured defect.** A `PreToolUse` hook fired through the informational
`fire_tool_hooks` seam recorded `last_status: "blocked"` next to `enforcement: "enforcing"` —
and the out-of-workspace write it claimed to block landed on disk. Driven twice, on codex
(`C52`) and on claude-code (`K39`/`O39`: the hook fired 3× and `hooked1.txt` still said
`HOOKED`). Worse than inert: it reported success.

`ActionResult.blocked` is a *request* ("PreToolUse exit_code 2 is a block signal"), and only
`fire_for_ids` — whose two callers turn it into the `BLOCKED:` sentinel — converts that request
into a refusal. So the status is written per FIRE, not per exit code.

The three states an operator must be able to tell apart from the trigger surface, each pinned
below:

1. fired and BLOCKED         → `last_status == "blocked"`, outcome `REFUSED`
2. fired and only REPORTED   → `last_status == "advisory"`, outcome `RAN` + a reason saying so
3. never fired               → `hook_to_record` returns None (no row at all)

`test_informational_fire_never_records_blocked` is the rail: revert the `enforced` branch in
`hooks.run_script_hook` and it goes red, which is the whole point of it existing.
