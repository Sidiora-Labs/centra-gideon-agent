"""One run-history feed across all three trigger kinds (AUTO §7 criterion 4 — S84).

Criterion 4: "A hook, an event trigger, and a cron all show run history in the same feed with the
same record shape and typed outcomes."

**Measured before writing.** `/api/triggers/history` existed and its own docstring said "(schedule
runs)". The per-trigger route answered `supported: false` for the other two kinds — honest then,
since only schedules had rows. And `FireRecord`, the typed row S62 designed for exactly this, was
**exported and never constructed** (`grep 'FireRecord('` outside its module: nothing).

The load-bearing tests are the two honesty ones: a counter must not become N fabricated rows
(`test_a_fire_counter_becomes_ONE_summary_row`), and `launched` must not become `ran`
(`test_launched_maps_to_deferred_not_ran`).
