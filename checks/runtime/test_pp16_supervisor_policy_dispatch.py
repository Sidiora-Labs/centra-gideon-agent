"""`PP-16` seam 3 — the CALL SITE, not the mechanism.

The seam's claim is that the loop supervisor stopped being pluggable Python: the convergence
decision is now DECLARED in `workflows/supervisor_policy.KIND_CONVERGENCE` and evaluated by the one
kind-agnostic evaluator in `loop/supervisor.py`. A test that only exercised `supervisor.done_signal`
directly would prove nothing about that — a policy object nothing dispatches through is the
"declared strategy without an executor" shape this repo keeps getting burned by, and the deleted
plugin would still be the thing that decided if the watchdog had never been rewired.

So every assertion here drives the REAL `LoopWatchdog._poll_once` over a real store row and
observes the shipped seam:

* the watchdog RESOLVES a policy for all five kinds (spying on the `policy_for_kind` name the
  watchdog module actually calls), and the policy it resolves is the declared row; and
* the MECHANISM the table names for a kind is the mechanism that then runs — a `verify_command`
  row really spawns the command path, a `judge_assessment` row really reaches the judge, a `never`
  row reaches neither, and an `orchestrated` row does not reach the point-in-time evaluator at all
  because its per-cycle hook owns done-ness.

Vacuity floors: each spy carries a positive control (it observed something) and the mechanism
matrix is cross-checked in the negative direction (a judge row must NOT run a command, and vice
versa), so a spy that silently observed nothing cannot pass by being uniformly blind.
