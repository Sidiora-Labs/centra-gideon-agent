"""The run-side PLURAL tasks projection (PP-16 seam 4e, OWNER RULING 1).

The ruling's operative sentence: "a run that projects to tasks carries the PLURAL shape,
matching the live field." Seam 4c did the destructive half (the inert singular
`WorkflowRun.task_list_id` is gone); this rails the constructive half —
`materialize.task_list_ids_for_run`, the DERIVED `{node_id: task_list_id}` map that gives the
loop row's `task_list_ids` column a destination when the row retires.

**Why derived and not stored.** Both halves of every entry already persist on the Task rows
themselves: the `workflow_binding` carries `(run_id, node_id)` and `Task.task_list_id` is the
structural parent. A stored run-side column would be a second copy of the truth — the exact
shape whose singular form seam 4c deleted so it could never be mis-filled.

**Railed in both directions, plus the measured reality.** The projection returns the plural
mapping from REAL persisted bindings (written and re-read through the actual native store, not
in-memory stand-ins), and an empty / unbound / foreign-run query projects `{}`. The middle
truth is pinned too: the engine's own write (`controller._write_projected_task`) passes no
`task_list_id`, so a fresh run honestly projects `{}` until its tasks are filed into lists —
a move the write façade permits because `task_list_id` is not engine-owned.
