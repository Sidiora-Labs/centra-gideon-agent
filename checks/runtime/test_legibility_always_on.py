"""PEP-10 — the always-on conventions viewer, and the three domain-craft skills.

The clause that decides whether this atom is real is *"the viewer matches what a session
actually receives"*. A viewer that renders its own idea of the conventions is worse than no
viewer: it drifts silently while the user trusts it. So the load-bearing test in this file is
:func:`test_viewer_items_appear_in_a_really_assembled_session_prompt` — it assembles a REAL
session prompt through ``ContextBuilder.build_session_context`` (the composer every session runs
through) and asserts every item the viewer reports is a substring of it.

Every comparison here carries a **vacuity assertion**. An empty viewer matching an empty prompt
passes forever, and on a fresh home the always-on skill tier is genuinely empty — no bundled
skill ships ``always: true`` — so this rail would be vacuous by default. Each test therefore
plants real content and asserts the planted content was non-trivial before comparing.
