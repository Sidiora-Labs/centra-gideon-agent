"""The trigger-source coordination line is executable, not prose.

CHANNEL-EXPANSION ``CE-9`` clause 3 / ``T7.6``.

``CE-9``'s third clause wants "a coordination line into WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE
[recording] the app-registered trigger-source forward obligation with no bespoke early event
glue shipped". A forward obligation is the single most rot-prone sentence a plan can carry:
it is written while the thing it waits on does not exist, and it keeps reading fine long
after that thing ships. That is exactly what happened here. The 2026-07-26 amendment wrote
"once WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE exposes app-registered source types", the guide's
vendor-completeness table wrote "*when that seam exists* ... until it lands", and then
``WF2AUT-8`` landed the seam and both sentences quietly became false. A contributor reading
the guide was told to wait for something they could already use.

So the four things the coordination line asserts are pinned here:

1. **The seam is REAL, not merely declared.** ``trigger_source`` being a ``PROVIDER_TYPES``
   member proves nothing on its own: a type can sit in the frozenset with no runtime handler,
   in which case a manifest declaring it resolves to nothing. The handler and the SDK contract
   identity are what make the guide's instruction executable, so all three are asserted
   together.
2. **The guide no longer tells a contributor to wait.** The stale conditional phrasing is
   forbidden in that table row by name. This is the "absent-vs-declared-false" guard pointed
   the other way: a shipped capability must not read as an unshipped one.
3. **The guide's replacement instruction is executable and still forbids hand-rolled glue.**
   Both halves have to survive a future edit. Dropping the prohibition would invite the
   bespoke event loop the whole coordination exists to prevent; dropping the declaration would
   put the row back to being useless.
4. **The plan records BOTH halves of the obligation, and the adoption half still has no owner
   atom.** The core seam is discharged; per-app adoption is ``0/4``. If someone mints the
   adoption atom, clause 4 reds and the coordination block has to stop saying nobody owns it.

None of this checks the apps repo, which is not in this tree. The ``0/4`` adoption count and
the swept-for-glue evidence live in the coordination block itself, sourced from a measured
sweep and dated there.
