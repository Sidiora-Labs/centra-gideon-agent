"""End-to-end: an ACP wire frame → the effective-risk decision and the task-mode gate.

`G10` — "effective risk is heuristic and mis-calibrated in both directions". Every
claude ``session/request_permission`` frame arrived with ``tool_kind: ""`` because the
declared kind lives on the *preceding* ``tool_call`` frame, so ``task_modes``' kind→risk
mapping had nothing to read on the approval path; and a shell call whose command text
had not arrived yet resolved to the LITERAL ``"destructive"``, auditing a read-only
``pwd; ls`` as destructive (`O7`, `O10`) while the same missing text made ask mode deny a
read-only ``ls`` (`O13`).

These tests deliberately start at the **JSON-RPC frame** and end at the **risk verdict /
gate answer**, through ``acp_event_to_agent_event`` — never at the layer that authors the
kind. `#1877` measured why that matters: ``translate.py`` authored ``tool_meta`` correctly
and the adapter, documented as mapping "field-for-field", dropped the field, so a live
consumer could not execute. A test that asserts the decoder's output would have passed.
``TestTheAdapterLink`` pins that boundary for ``tool_kind`` explicitly.
