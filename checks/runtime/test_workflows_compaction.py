"""The two-layer context-compaction ladder for LLM-backed workflow nodes (WV-12).

What is actually load-bearing here, and why each is a test rather than a review comment:

* **The proactive layer fires on MEASUREMENT, not on a guess.** A test that only checked
  "a huge prompt gets compacted" would pass against a hardcoded char cap. These pin the
  threshold to `model_context_window` by driving the SAME prompt against a small-window
  model and a large-window one and asserting only the small one compacts.
* **Layer 2 is length-specific.** A ladder that retried every exception would spend a
  second model call on a 429 or a bad credential — things compaction provably cannot fix.
* **Degrade-to-drop-with-placeholder is the rung that keeps a node alive.** "The
  summarizer failed" means a supplied `summarize_fn` RAISED — `summarize_fn=None` is a
  working configuration (`compact` digests deterministically), so the raise is the case
  worth proving, and the placeholder must NAME the loss rather than silently substituting
  a weaker artifact that reads downstream as a complete summary.
* **Anti-thrashing is wired, not reimplemented.** The controller owns the per-node history
  and the ladder appends to it in place; a copy handed out per call would leave
  `should_compact` looking at a permanently empty list.
* **Tool-pair integrity, anchoring and the prefix guard are NOT re-tested here.**
  `context_compaction` owns them and `test_context_compaction.py` covers them. What IS
  tested is that this module routes through that seam, because a second implementation of
  those rules is the drift risk — an orphaned tool-result breaks the provider.

    `audit-sweep` is the long-horizon shape in the bundled library: an `until_dry` loop

    completeness critic every cycle, each binding `{{inputs.target}}` into its prompt. That
    is exactly the growth pattern the ladder exists for, and it is why a unit test alone is
    not sufficient evidence — the unit tests call the ladder, this proves the ENGINE calls
    it, on a real spec, with a real controller, journal and state on disk.
