"""Nothing to install FROM and zero MATCHES are different facts, and the search said neither.

Two sources register at import (`skills/native.py`): `native` mirrors the bundled catalogue and
`installed` mirrors the user's own skills. Neither is somewhere to install FROM — the fan-out
skips `installed` outright and then filters every `native` hit out as already present. So on a
fresh install the store can offer nothing FOR ANY QUERY, and `{"results": [], "counts": {}}` was
byte-identical to a query that genuinely matched nothing. The panel then showed *"No results —
try a different search term or marketplace"*, blaming the query (issue 1780).

Issue 1780 reads this as "the registry is empty". It is not, and that matters: `len(info())` is
**2** on a fresh install, so a naive count would have reported "sources configured" about two
mirrors of what the user already has. `installable_sources` counts sources whose declared
`marketplace_type` is not `native`, which is a property the interface already carries rather
than the two names hardcoded.

This is the repo's own "a failed fetch renders as an empty state" shape: the surface cannot be
told apart from a working surface with nothing to show, so nobody notices for as long as it takes
somebody to go looking.

**The response carries a COUNT, not a message.** The store's source filter already renders
per-source counts, so a number is the fact the frontend is missing; composing the sentence in the
handler would put UI copy in an API. The panel branches on `=== 0` rather than on a falsy check, so
a FAILED request keeps the ordinary wording instead of asserting a configuration fact it never
learned.

What is deliberately NOT changed: no marketplace is bundled to make the registry non-empty. Which
catalogue ships by default is a product decision, and shipping "the middle" — a slightly better
empty state plus a half-registered source — is what the issue asks not to do.
