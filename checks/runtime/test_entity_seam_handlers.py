"""The non-registry provider types are honest enable/disable seams.

The extension ``ProviderRegistry`` has real type handlers for the types that own
a consumed domain registry (model/task/workflow/memory/tool/hook/prompt/channel/
knowledge) and ``EntitySeamHandler`` for the types whose real entity lives in a
separate subsystem: agent, inbox, skills, notification.

These tests pin the seam invariant: the seam must NAME where each entity actually
lives (so no future feature wires the Nth consumer of a no-op path), a genuine
factory↔registry contract mismatch must be flagged for its owner, and enabling
such an extension must NOT smuggle an instance into a domain registry — that would
create a second source of truth.
