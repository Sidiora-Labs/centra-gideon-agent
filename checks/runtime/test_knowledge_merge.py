"""Near-duplicate surfacing + merge (KNOWLEDGE-LIBRARY T3.2).

A merge DELETES one of two items, so the tests are mostly about what must NOT be lost:

* **Curation.** The survivor inherits both items' collections, tags and mentions. A merge
  that dropped the losing copy's shelf membership would quietly undo work the user did.
* **The stronger signal.** Merging a `read`+favorited copy into an `unread` one must not
  demote it — the user's engagement is the thing worth keeping.
* **The search index.** `items_fts` is an EXTERNAL-CONTENT table: a plain `DELETE` is a
  silent no-op and a mismatched `'delete'` corrupts the posting list without raising. The
  merge reuses `_delete_item_cascade`, which owns that contract.
* **Itself.** A self-merge would run the cascade delete on the survivor.
