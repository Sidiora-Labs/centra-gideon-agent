"""Tests for intent classification and tiered template matching (UNIVERSAL-PLANNING S1).

Two things make these tests different from the module's own development:

**The routing fixtures are the deployment gate, and they are UNSEEN.** A keyword classifier tuned
against the same examples that measure it reports its training set back. `tests/fixtures/
planner_routing.json` was written from how a user actually types — lowercase, abbreviated, missing
the keywords the classifier hopes for — and the classifier was corrected until it passed. Measured
along the way: 68% on first contact against an 85% bar.

**A router that cannot explain itself cannot be corrected.** So the reason strings and the
confidence SPREAD are asserted, not just the winners: a confidence that reads 0.95 for everything
is a number carrying no information, which is how a review surface stops being read.
