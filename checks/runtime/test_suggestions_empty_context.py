"""An empty instance must fall back to the canned suggestions on EVERY day of the year.

`suggestions._build_context` used to append a `## Current Time` section unconditionally, and
`generate_suggestions` guards on `len(context) < 50`. A lone time section measures 44-53 characters
depending on how long today's weekday and month names are, so the guard's outcome was decided by the
calendar:

    "Friday, May 01 2026 at 07:30"        ->  44 chars  -> falls back (correct)
    "Wednesday, September 02 2026 at 07:30" -> 53 chars  -> passes the guard, calls the LLM

Counted over 2026: 253 days fell back and **113 days did not** — a third of the year spent asking a
model for suggestions from a context containing nothing but a timestamp. And the first
`/api/suggestions` call AWAITS that generation for up to 45s (`api_suggestions` blocks while
`generated_at == 0`), so a new user's chat chips appeared either instantly or after most of a minute
depending on the day of the week.

🪤 THE DATES HERE ARE THE POINT, NOT DECORATION. A single frozen date would pass against the buggy
code roughly two days in three, which is the worst kind of test — green on most CI runs and red on
Wednesdays. The parametrisation pins both extremes of the old straddle plus the exact boundary, so a
regression cannot hide in a lucky calendar.
