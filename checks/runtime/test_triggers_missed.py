"""Missed fires: review, don't lie, don't storm (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.4 — S65).

Local-first means a closed lid stops the loop, so the honest question after a restart is not "what
should have run" but "what do I tell the user about what didn't".

**The defect this session found in its own first draft.** The shared enumeration budget originally
bounded the COUNT. Driven with thirty triggers each down a week: the alphabetically-first minutely
trigger spent all 480 counting its own 10,080 missed slots, and **twenty-nine triggers got no review
card at all** — the page would have shown one trigger and silently
omitted the rest, which is precisely
the "don't lie" failure §3.4 names. The budget now bounds the ROWS BUILT: counting is one division,
allocating objects is what makes boot slow. Same budget, 24 of 30
triggers get cards, and every count
stays exact so the summaries are honest.
