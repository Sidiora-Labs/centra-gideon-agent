"""``/api/providers/{name}/config`` must hold the same write-only secret policy as
``/api/apps/{name}/config`` — one file, one ``x-meta.sensitive`` flag, one policy.

It did not. ``checks/runtime/test_app_api.py::test_sensitive_config_field_is_write_only`` pinned the
rule on the Apps route (#43) while the Providers route — the one the Settings → Providers
schema form actually calls — returned the stored secret verbatim on GET and echoed it back
on PATCH. For the bundled ``slack-channel`` app that meant its Bot Token and App Token in
every panel-open response, in the form's React state, and revealable on screen through the
field's show/hide toggle.

Found while measuring #952/#953 against a real gateway: the very PATCH used to save Slack
tokens through the dashboard replied with them in cleartext.

The last test is the rail: the policy is asserted to live in exactly ONE module, because
two implementations of one rule are how the routes diverged in the first place.
