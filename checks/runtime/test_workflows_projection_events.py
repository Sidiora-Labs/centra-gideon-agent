"""The task-projection events on both channels (TASKS-SOPS §7/§8 — S61e).

The FE stream unions were recorded as BLOCKED in S61c: the engine emitted none of
`task_materialized`, `confirmation_pending`, `confirmation_resolved`, `task_verified`
and `cascade_blocked`,
and registering a union member for an event nothing sends would be the same present-and-
inert control this program keeps finding. This session unblocks them by emitting on both
channels at once.

Two channels, one vocabulary. The LIVE stream (`RunController._publish`, what the FE folds)
and the REPLAYABLE ledger (`journal`, what a refiner and a diagnosis read) carry the same
fact under names that differ only by the `workflow_` prefix. A consumer folding the stream
and one reconstructing from history would otherwise need two vocabularies for one event, and
the second always drifts.

Measured before asserting: `RunController._publish` accepts ANY event name — there is no
server-side allowlist — so the FE's `WORKFLOW_LIFECYCLE` array is the only gate, and
EventSource silently drops an unregistered type. A member missing from that list is not a
component ignoring an event; it is an event the frontend never receives, with nothing
anywhere to say so.
