"""One host-fact collector, so the fit answer cannot disagree with itself (LMMV-8).

The GPU/VRAM-total probe and the system-memory probe used to be collected in two unrelated
places each: :mod:`gideon.local_models.fit` for the fit budget and
:mod:`gideon.dashboard.handlers_system` for the system widget. Two collectors mean two
answers, and a fit chip that names a different VRAM total than the system card is worse than
no chip. These tests pin the single-source split:

* **capacity facts** (GPU vendor/model, VRAM *total*, unified-vs-discrete, memory total) are
  detected exactly once — in ``fit`` for the GPU, in ``local_models.residency`` for memory;
* **live telemetry** (utilisation, temperature, *used* VRAM, the disk gauge) stays in the
  metrics handler, because it changes every tick and is nobody's capacity input.

Every census here carries a **vacuity floor**: a pattern that matches nothing looks clean
while proving nothing, so each census asserts it found its subject before it asserts where
the subject lives.
