"""Staleness of a synthesized item, and the two routes a "sources changed" banner needs.

WF2KNO-11 clause A. What is worth asserting here is not that the flag flips — it is that the
flag flips for a *defensible* reason and stays down for everything else:

1. **A fresh synthesis is not stale.** The material that existed when it was written is not
   new material. Getting this wrong lights the banner on every document permanently, which
   is the failure mode that makes readers ignore banners.
2. **The COUNT, not just the boolean.** The banner names a number, so the number is what the
   test pins. A rule that answered "stale: true" with the wrong count would still pass a
   boolean assertion.
3. **The two rules are separable.** A tagged newcomer moves ``new_source_items``; touching a
   CITED source moves ``changed_sources``. Asserting one total would let either rule rot
   silently behind the other.
4. **An observed item is never stale.** "Stale" on a note would mean a different thing
   (the world moved on from a fact) with a different remedy, so the rule is asserted
   directly rather than left to be inferred from the synthesized cases.
5. **Regenerate has to actually file a proposal.** The banner's one action was an inert
   control — it reported ``ok: true`` while the update layer filed nothing — and it survived
   because every regenerate test here pinned a REFUSAL path (404/400/503) and none pinned the
   success path. So the success case asserts the pending row EXISTS in the proposal store and
   carries the recomputed prose; a body-shape assertion would have passed against the broken
   route. Its two honest empty outcomes (nothing cited, no model) are pinned beside it,
   because "filed nothing" and "reported success" must never be the same response again.
