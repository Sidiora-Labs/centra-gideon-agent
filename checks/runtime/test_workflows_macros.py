"""Template macros — one-liner patterns that expand into core nodes (Slice 9a).

The engine has twelve node kinds and no more. A judge panel, adversarial verification, intent
routing and a multi-modal sweep are all COMPOSITIONS of those kinds — adding `judge_panel` as
a thirteenth kind would mean a scheduler case, a dispatcher, a resume path, a rewind story and
a widget row for it.

The load-bearing claims:

* **expansion is at definition time**, so nothing downstream knows macros exist. The engine,
  the journal, the resume cache and the rewind cascade all see ordinary nodes;
* **every expansion validates**, which is the whole reason to expand before the write — a
  malformed macro fails at save with a real node path instead of mid-run with a synthetic one;
* **scoring legs are `infer`, never `stage`** (WF2-R16). A judge that reads text and returns a
  score needs no session, no tools and no lane slot; using `stage` turns a five-judge panel
  into five concurrent subagent sessions;
* **the input is never mutated**, because the save path re-reads the author's original for its
  response and expanding under it would make stored and returned specs silently differ.
