"""Criterion 10: a completed fire notifies with a deep link, and a retry does not double-ping
(S140).

Criterion 10: *"A completed-run notification deep-links (`statusUrl`) to the exact run journal
row; a
retried delivery does not double-ping."*

🔴 THE DEFECT — two dead layers, the same shape as S139's autopause chain. `triggers/delivery.py`
implements the criterion in full: `statusUrl` deep links, stable event ids for retry dedup,
`is_duplicate`, destination formatting. But `build_delivery`'s only caller was
`executor.delivery_for`, **which itself had no caller at all**. Driven before writing: a
completed fire
produced no notification and no `statusUrl` anywhere under the home.

**Routes through `state.notify`**, which is `deliver`'s own contract. R18: *"the substrate does not
build a second notification path"* — so the existing `notification_allowed` gate and the
per-(source,
kind) rule still apply, and a muted channel stays muted.
