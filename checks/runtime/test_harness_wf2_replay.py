"""Tests for the SV-5 WF2 replay scenarios — the journal-format gate (Success Criterion #4).

SV-5 adds two required replay scenarios on top of the Session-3 substrate:

- ``workflow-journal-projection`` — a workflow run's journal folded into its per-run SSE
  projection, green against the current journal format;
- ``rewind-during-stream`` — a rewind (epoch bump) mid-stream, proving the fold's epoch
  supersede-drop guard drops a stale in-flight event.

Both carry a ``fold`` baseline that pins the event-fold law (WF2-R11): folding the recorded
projection reconstructs exactly one terminal state. These prove the four halves of SC#4:

1. both scenarios are recorded + green against their checked-in baselines;
2. a format change that breaks the event-fold law fails the compare;
3. a missing required scenario fails the run outright;
4. the workflow journal→SSE projection is recordable through the existing SSE tap (no
   engine change) — asserted by driving the recorder at the same seam the gateway uses.
