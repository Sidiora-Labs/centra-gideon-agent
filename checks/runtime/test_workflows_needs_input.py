"""Tests for the NeedsInputItem contract (WORK-CONTAINERS §6.1 R1, S51).
 The card exists so a blocked run is answerable from a glance. Four properties carry it, and
each was measured against the engine's real vocabulary rather than a guessed one.  **The block
classifier must cover the ENGINE's failure classes.** An earlier version matched `dependency`,
`capability` and `config` — none of which are real `FailureClass` values — so every capability
failure fell through to "a decision", and the card asked the user to decide about a missing
credential instead of telling them to add one.  **A transient block is not the user's to
answer.** Surfacing a rate limit as a decision asks the user to do the system's waiting, and
it trains them to click through cards — which is how a real approval gets clicked through too.
**Owner binding is anti-hijack.** A gate surfaced into a shared channel must only be
answerable by the session that raised it, or answering it is a privilege escalation dressed as
convenience.  **Staleness reminds once.** A card that reminds every sweep becomes the
notification the user mutes, and muting is per-source, so it takes every genuinely urgent card
with it.
