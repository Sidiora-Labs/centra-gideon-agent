"""Refresh + registry-drift regressions (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 §11/§12, LMMV-7).

Two invariants that have each already broken once, locked with BEFORE/AFTER registration
evidence rather than a smoke check:

**(a) The two-population invariant (Success Criterion 9).** Every use-case registry holds
two populations: providers built from ``config.json`` on demand (remote adapters, the env
stub, scanner-contributed entries) and providers an APP contributed once through
``ModelTypeHandler`` on enable. ``refresh_providers()`` exists to re-read the FIRST
population; it must never touch the second. The original bug cleared the whole dict, which
silently unregistered the bundled backend until the next gateway restart. A count-only
assertion is not enough here, so every case asserts three things: the bundled provider is
STILL THE SAME OBJECT, the transient one is GONE (the vacuity guard — a ``refresh_providers``
that had become a no-op would otherwise pass), and the before/after totals move by exactly
the transient population's size.

**(b) Registry drift.** A sidecar/local model provider routed through
``ModelTypeHandler.register`` must land in the local-model registry under the APP name
(``ext.name``) — not under the provider's own ``.name``, which for a sidecar proxy is an
internal spelling (``faster_whisper`` vs the ``faster-whisper`` app) that no binding ref
uses. It must satisfy the ``is_local_model_provider`` duck-type on the way in, and it must
survive the use-case registry's ``refresh_providers()``. Drift in any one of the three
reads as "the model is not installed" in the UI while the provider is loaded in-process.
