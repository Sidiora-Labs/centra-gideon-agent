"""One projection to tasks (PP-16) — the loop side and the run side must not each carry their
own answer to "has this task finished".

A loop and a `WorkflowRun` are the same work unit in two shapes, so a task status cannot mean
one thing to the loop's phase gate and another to the engine's projection. The loop side used to
carry its own string list; this rail is what keeps it from growing a second one back.

**Railed in both drift directions.** A new `TaskStatus` member with no ruling reds, and a
predicate that stops agreeing with the canonical `TERMINAL_STATUSES` reds. Both are the failure
mode that matters: a status the gate does not recognize is finished work the loop waits on
forever.

**The agreement assertions carry a vacuity floor.** "Both sides agree" is satisfied trivially by
two constant functions, so a rail that only compared them would assert nothing — the floor below
proves each predicate actually discriminates, and that the two are genuinely different notions
rather than one function under two names.
