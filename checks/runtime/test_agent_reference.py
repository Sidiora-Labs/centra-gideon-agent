"""Drift guard for the shipped offline agent reference (PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY §3.1).

The reference under ``gideon/reference/*.md`` is GENERATED from the same
``build_manifest`` output the live ``/api/manifest`` walks — one source, two
renderings. This suite is what keeps the checked-in copy honest: it renders fresh
and byte-compares, so a tool/route added without its ``TOOL_META`` / route entry
(or a manual edit to the generated files) reddens the build. When it fires, the
failure message spells out the remedy — see :data:`_STALE_REMEDY`, which pins
``PYTHONPATH`` because a bare ``python -m gideon.manifest_reference`` run from
a worktree regenerates the MAIN checkout instead, and which says that drift on a
branch touching no route is usually ``main``'s from a merge-train union.

It also asserts the two operator-facing contracts the reference exists to serve:
the `pclaw-api` skill points at a reference that actually exists and cross-links
`pclaw-features`, and ``doctor --paths`` resolves the reference dir the skill tells
agents to find.

#: What to do when the drift guard fires. Spelled out here rather than as a bare
#: `python -m …` because both ways of getting this wrong have really happened:
#:
#: 1. **Run from a git worktree and the regeneration lands in the MAIN checkout.** The
#:    repo's `.venv` is an editable install of the main tree, so `-m` resolves
#:    `gideon` there no matter where you stand; the generator prints absolute
#:    paths and writes four files into a checkout you are not working in — on `main`,
#:    where a concurrent commit can sweep them into someone else's diff — while your
#:    own `git status` stays empty and this test keeps failing. Pinning `PYTHONPATH`
#:    is what makes the write land where you are.
#: 2. **Assume the drift belongs to your branch.** It often does not. These files are
#:    a pure function of the tree, so two PRs can each regenerate correctly against
#:    their own base and still be wrong in the union the merge train builds: the
#:    aggregate count line in `index.md` is not something a three-way merge can get
#:    right, and neither side of that conflict is correct. The consequence is drift on
#:    `main` with no commit touching the file, and then EVERY open PR inherits this
#:    failure — so check `origin/main` before hunting through your own diff.
