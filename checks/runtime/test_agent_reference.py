"""Drift guard for the shipped offline agent reference (PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY §3.1).

The reference under ``gideon/reference/*.md`` is GENERATED from the same
``build_manifest`` output the live ``/api/manifest`` walks — one source, two
renderings. This suite is what keeps the checked-in copy honest: it renders fresh
and byte-compares, so a tool/route added without its ``TOOL_META`` / route entry
(or a manual edit to the generated files) reddens the build. Regenerate with
``python -m gideon.manifest_reference``.

It also asserts the two operator-facing contracts the reference exists to serve:
the `gideon-api` skill points at a reference that actually exists and cross-links
`gideon-features`, and ``doctor --paths`` resolves the reference dir the skill tells
agents to find.
