"""PP-15 — the widened convergence core: purity, restartability, and a REAL replan.

Three claims are load-bearing and each is easy to assert falsely:

1. **Purity is PRESERVED and RE-PROVEN.** `evaluate` gained the escalation ladder, and the
   ladder it absorbed was stateful — `check_middleware` advanced a cursor on its own
   argument, so asking it twice gave two answers. A test that only checks the new enum
   members exist would not notice that regression. So the same `(cfg, state, now)` must
   yield the same `Decision` on every branch, and no clock may leak in.
2. **Restartability.** Every input is derived from persisted state, so a fresh process
   re-derives the same `Decision` — including WHICH RUNG. Proven by round-tripping the
   snapshot through JSON bytes, which is the only form a restart actually gets.
3. **`REPLAN` queues a REAL mutation batch.** Asserting that the enum member came back
   would satisfy nothing: the behaviour being replaced (retry with the critique stapled to
   the prompt) also "returns a decision". So the test drives a real run and asserts the SPEC
   changed and the re-derived step EXECUTED.
