"""``walk_window`` must report BOTH of its caps, and only when it really truncated.

🔴 Issue 2553. ``walk_window`` enforces two caps and reported one. ``MAX_ELEMENTS`` set
``walk.truncated = True``; ``MAX_DEPTH`` silently dropped the whole subtree and left the flag
at its ``False`` default, so ``op_snapshot`` forwarded ``"truncated": False`` and a deep window
reached the model **labelled complete**.

That contradicted the function's own two stated contracts — its docstring ("a truncated answer
*that says so* is more useful than a killed process") and ``MAX_ELEMENTS``' comment ("a window
exposing more is truncated *and says so*"). Absent and complete are different facts, and this is
the read a model uses to decide what is on screen: asked whether a window holds a password
field, it saw the walked elements and ``truncated: false``, and could only conclude no.
``MAX_DEPTH`` of 25 is generous for a native window and not generous for a Chromium or Electron
one, which is exactly where such a field lives.

**Why there is a test per cap rather than one truncation test.** A single assertion on
``truncated`` passed on the unfixed code, because the element cap set the flag correctly and
masked the depth cap entirely. One test covering "truncation is reported" is precisely the shape
that let this survive, so each cap is pinned separately and neither can regress alone.

The two floors matter as much as the two caps. Fixing this by setting the flag unconditionally on
the depth branch would make every deep-but-complete tree claim truncation — a flag that is always
true carries no information and teaches its reader to ignore it, which is the same defect facing
the other way. So a complete tree and a leaf sitting exactly at the limit both assert ``False``.

The walk is driven over a synthetic element tree by faking the FFI helpers, because the suite's
existing computer-use tests mock ``walk_window`` itself and therefore never exercise its
internals — which is the other reason this went unnoticed.
