"""GET /api/sessions/{key} — a missing session is a 404, not an empty transcript.

The endpoint used to answer ``200 []`` for ANY unknown key, so a polling client
could not tell a mistyped or deleted session from a real session with no
messages — it silently read emptiness as truth (the exact failure the loop
endpoints already 404 on). The one deliberate exception: a LIVE session whose
file has not been written yet (a just-opened tab) still answers ``[]`` —
answering 404 there would break polling a brand-new chat.
