"""Tests for the ConfirmationRequest record and its gates (TASKS-SOPS §4 R6, S57).

Two shipped defects were found by measuring, and both are pinned here.

**Single-use resolution did not hold.** `consume_continuation` documented "only one
unlink succeeds", and with 8 threads racing one token MULTIPLE callers received the
payload in 36 of 40 trials — the exact double-approval replay the rule exists to
prevent. `os.rename` decides the winner before anything is read: 0 of 40.

**`security.redact` missed three real credential shapes.** A key with hyphens in the
body, a generic `api_key=<value>` assignment, and a bearer token all survived into what
is supposed to be a redacted preview — the single most likely place for a fetched
credential to reach an inbox row.

The third property is that expiry is per-TYPE. Auto-rejecting a destructive confirmation
is safe; auto-rejecting a needs-input question throws away the work that was waiting on
the answer.
