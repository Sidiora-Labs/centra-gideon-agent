"""MRT-5's missing executor: the fold write asks whether the evidence outgrew the table.

``routing/proposals.py`` shipped complete and had **zero production importers** — ``propose`` took a
``current``, a ``proposed`` and an ``evidence`` dict and computed no gap, so the ``done_when``
clause *"a genuine quality gap at n>=5 enqueues a routing proposal"* had no ``n>=5``, no gap
detection and no call anywhere. ``routing/gap.py`` is that caller and ``stats.record_routing_stats``
is its trigger point; these rails exist so that deleting either would be caught.

Three things are asserted here that a green ``test_routing_proposals.py`` could not reach:

* **the wire** — driving the real ``record_routing_stats`` (the per-attempt hook the audit path
  calls) leaves a proposal in the queue. Replace the ``_check_for_gap`` call with ``pass`` and
  :class:`TestTheWire` goes red;
* **propose-don't-write across the WHOLE path**, not just across ``propose``: a model call that
  produces a proposal leaves ``routing_policy.json`` byte-identical, with a floor proving the same
  comparison sees the write that accepting it makes;
* **SC #8** — with both JSON files deleted the path degrades and writes no ``memory.db`` /
  ``knowledge.db``, a negative given a floor so it cannot pass vacuously.

Every test drives an isolated ``tmp_path`` home through ``GIDEON_HOME`` (read per call, cached
nowhere) and asserts the redirect bound. Nothing here may touch the real ``~/.gideon``.
