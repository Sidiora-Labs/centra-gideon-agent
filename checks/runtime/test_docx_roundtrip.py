"""DFE-3: parse → write → parse, across every `BLOCK_KIND`, and the proof it is not vacuous.

The fixture is one rich `DocumentModel` exercising **every** member of `BLOCK_KINDS` plus
inline run spans, paragraph styles, table cells and page setup. It is rendered by this
repo's writer, parsed, re-rendered and re-parsed, and the suite makes three separate
claims about that circuit:

1. `test_the_round_trip_recovers_the_authored_model` — the parse of the writer's output
   equals the model that was authored. This is the claim with teeth.
2. `test_parse_write_parse_is_stable` — the second lap equals the first. Idempotence
   catches a *classification* bug that claim 1 cannot: a parser that reads a construct
   into a shape it then re-renders differently would loop forever without converging.
3. `test_a_deliberate_writer_regression_reds_the_round_trip` — with one writer property
   suppressed, claim 1 must FAIL.

Claim 3 exists because claims 1 and 2 are not interchangeable, and the difference is the
whole reason the acceptance bar demands a regression test. **Idempotence alone is blind to
a uniform writer regression**: if the writer stopped emitting bold, the first parse would
report no bold, the re-render would emit no bold, and the second parse would agree — a
perfectly stable round trip over a document that lost its formatting. Only comparing
against the AUTHORED model can see that, which is why claim 3 asserts an `AssertionError`
out of claim 1's helper and not out of claim 2's.

The comparison runs over a canonical projection rather than raw dataclass equality,
because the model deliberately offers two ways to say the same thing (`text` beside
`runs`, `rows` beside `cells`) and the writer renders them identically. The projection
collapses exactly those documented equivalences and NOTHING else — every property the
writer can express stays in the comparison, which is what makes the regressions red.
