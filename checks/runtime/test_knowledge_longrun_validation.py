"""Long-run validation for the Knowledge Synthesis program (§8 success criteria).

These are the properties that only break AFTER a while: a watcher whose cost grows every cycle,
a seen-set that resets on restart, a persist that duplicates on the fiftieth retry. None of them
fail loudly — the run keeps working and just gets slower, more expensive, or quietly wrong. So
each test here simulates the passage of many cycles rather than checking one.

The plan's criteria this file covers:

* #2 — re-executing a persist is a provable no-op (no duplicate items, stable mention counts)
* #3 — a week of simulated cycles at bounded per-cycle cost, zero re-processed guids
* #5 — the seen-set survives a restart
* #6 — health and lint over a 100+-item store
* #8 — rich-ingest writes knowledge and tasks, and NOTHING to memory
