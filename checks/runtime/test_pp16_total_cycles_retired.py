"""`loops.total_cycles` is retired — the cycle count is the ledger projection (PP-16 seam 4a).

The column was a denormalized cache of something the ledger already derives: both of its writers in
`loop/watchdog.py` wrote exactly ``len(loop_files.get_findings(cid))``, and `get_findings` is a pure
projection over the `step_completed` records `PP-5` already ships. Deleting it removes a second
source of truth rather than moving one.

What these rails are for, and why each can FAIL:

* **The projection is the real source.** `test_the_count_moves_with_the_ledger` mutates the ledger
  (an extra `step_completed`) and asserts the number every reader sees moves with it. Its vacuity
  partner, `test_the_count_does_not_move_with_an_unrelated_ledger_kind`, writes a `judge_verdict`
  instead — a record on the same file, through the same writer — and asserts the count does NOT
  move. Without that partner, "the count tracks the ledger" would be satisfied by a counter that
  counted *lines*.
* **No writer survives.** `test_no_module_writes_the_retired_column` is an AST census over
  ``src/``: a stray writer is exactly how a retired cache comes back, and a grep-shaped assertion
  would be defeated by the (deliberate) prose mentions of the name in comments and docstrings. It
  asserts on real syntax — a string literal in a SQL statement, an assignment, a keyword argument —
  and carries its own vacuity floor (it proves the census walks the files it claims to).
* **Two expressions, one number.** `loop_files.cycles_completed()` routes through the ledger's
  `run_totals` aggregate while the two redacted views count the findings they already hold. Those
  are two code paths to one quantity, so `test_the_two_projections_agree` pins them equal — the
  drift this atom exists to prevent, reintroduced one level down, would otherwise be invisible.
* **A pre-change home still works.** The retirement adds no migration (see `store._connect`'s
  note): an existing `loops` table keeps the column, unread. That tolerance is the one real risk of
  not migrating, so it is measured rather than assumed.
