"""`PHF-7` clause 4 — a model-call path that skips the enforced helper must RED the gate.

Every model call is supposed to pass through :func:`gideon.security.guardrails.wrap_model_call_guard`,
which writes the ``model_calls.jsonl`` attempt audit, charges the spend meter and applies
the budget/breaker policy. A provider that reaches a caller UNWRAPPED still works perfectly —
it just spends money and takes actions with no audit row and no budget. That is the failure shape
this rail
exists for: silent, invisible, and indistinguishable from correct behaviour at runtime.

**Measured before it was written, on `origin/main`.** The invariant holds, so this gate ships
at ZERO because zero is the measured population — not as an aspiration:

* ``wrap_model_call_guard`` is called from exactly ONE place in ``src/`` —
  ``providers/provider_bridge._resolve_from_config_registry``, which wraps "at the single
  point where the entry name + model are known" (its own comment).
* ``resolve_provider_for_use_case`` has five provider-returning paths. Four return a value obtained
  from ``_resolve_from_config_registry``. The fifth is the native-agent branch,
  ``_build_native_runtime``, whose docstring records that "its inference ModelProvider is resolved
  through the SAME active-model" path — so its inner model is wrapped too, and the resolver's own
  SCOPE comment says the same of the ACP CLI branch.

So the allowlist below has exactly two entries, both verified to funnel into the chokepoint rather
than taken on trust: :func:`test_the_allowlisted_builder_actually_wraps` asserts the wrap call is
really inside ``_resolve_from_config_registry``, because an allowlist keyed on a NAME would keep
passing if that function stopped wrapping.

**Why AST and not a regex.** The property is structural — "does this return value come from an
allowlisted builder" — and a text scan cannot follow ``x = f(); … ; return x``. That indirection is
the normal shape here (four of the five paths look exactly like it), so a regex rail would either
miss every real bypass or flag every correct path.
