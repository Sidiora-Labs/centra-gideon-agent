"""PL-9 rail — the emitted, declared and negotiated API version share ONE origin.

Three surfaces name this number: the gateway EMITS it (``/api/manifest``'s
``apiVersion`` plus the two generated reference documents), the SPA DECLARES it
(``X-Gideon-API-Version``), and the gate NEGOTIATES it. The failure this
rail exists to prevent is the cheap one: someone types the literal a second time —
in another module, in a TypeScript file, in a test — and the three quietly drift
until a client is refused for a version the server actually speaks, or waved
through for one it does not.

So the rail is not "the numbers happen to be equal today". It asserts there is
exactly ONE place each value is written down, and that every other surface reads
it from there. Adding a second hard-coded api-version literal anywhere under
``src/gideon`` or ``web/src`` reds this file.
