"""Every run-control verb answers 404 for a run that does not exist.

Most already did. FOUR did not, and they did not fail quietly — they answered confidently about a
run that was not there. Three were reported; the fourth this rail found on its first run:

* ``confirm {verb: skip}`` and ``{verb: quit}`` returned **200**
  ``{"resumed": false, "still_pending": true}`` for a nonexistent id, because
  ``resolve_confirmation`` early-returned for the non-resuming verbs BEFORE any ``store.get``.
  Only approve/reject reached ``resume_run``, which is where the 404 lived. A tool firing skip at
  a typo'd or already-deleted run was told it had worked.
* ``rewind`` / ``run_from`` / ``edit`` returned **409 run_not_live** with "resume the run before
  rewind" — remediation for a run that cannot be resumed because there is nothing to resume. They
  asked ``_live()`` first, and a nonexistent run has no controller either.
* ``preview_edit`` answered ``WF_RUN_NO_SPEC`` — "run has no readable spec" — which ``_STATUS_MAP``
  translates to a **500 spec_unreadable**. The worst of the four: a typo'd id reported a server
  fault. Nobody reported this one; the table below did, which is the argument for enumerating the
  verbs rather than fixing the two that were noticed.

Both are issue 765. The same missing precheck is behind issue 679: ``resume`` answered
``{"resumed": true}`` on a complete/failed/cancelled run *and wrote to the finished run's ``extra``
on the way through*, because it checked existence but never terminality — while its three siblings
(cancel, pause, steer) all refuse with ``WF_RUN_ALREADY_TERMINAL``.

**Why the fix is one helper.** That ``_service_failure("WF_RUN_NOT_FOUND", ...)`` line appeared
**fourteen times, verbatim**. That is the reason three paths could omit it without looking
odd in review: there was no single thing to be missing. ``_run_or_missing`` makes "did this verb
check?" greppable.

🪤 THE FAKE VERSION OF THIS TEST asserts that `confirm{skip}` and `rewind` 404. That closes the
reported cases and says nothing about the next verb, which is exactly how four of thirteen came to
disagree in the first place. So the table below is the LIST of control verbs, and a new one has to
be added to it — a verb absent from the table is caught by
`test_the_table_covers_every_control_verb`, which reads the service's own exports rather than
trusting the table to be complete.
