"""The two-way readable vault (MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT §5 — MGAV-6).

Four properties carry this design, and nearly every test below asserts one of them:

1. **A wrong merge is unrecoverable, a refused one is not.** Anything the sync cannot
   parse with confidence is left EXACTLY as the human wrote it, flagged, and reported —
   never overwritten, never dropped, never guessed at.
2. **``source_hash`` covers the BODY ONLY.** The sync rewrites frontmatter on every
   pass; a hash over the frontmatter would make every page read as edited forever, and
   a hash over nothing would make none of them. Both directions are pinned.
3. **Append-only means append-only.** A sync never reorders or rewrites a timeline line,
   even when the record it cites is gone.
4. **Wikilinks come from ``mem_links``, not from the text.** A link the graph does not
   hold cannot appear on a page.
