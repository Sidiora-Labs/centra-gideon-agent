"""PCS-7 — ``cache_hit_pct``'s DISJOINTNESS evidence must keep resolving to live code.

``stats.cache_hit_pct`` does not merely assert that ``input_tokens`` excludes the cached
tokens; the whole denominator rests on that premise, and the docstring discharges it by
CITING independent places in the tree at ``path:line-range`` (eight anchors, tabled below).
That evidence block is load-bearing prose: a reader who cannot follow it has no way to check
the arithmetic, and a reader who follows a citation into unrelated code is actively misled.

Prose citations rot silently. Two of this docstring's citations already did, and neither of
the atom's two hand-run audit passes caught it, because nothing executes a docstring:

* ``dashboard/chat_runner.py:3712-3714`` was cited as composing the rendered "cached"
  figure as ``cache_read + cache_creation``. PCS-7 DELETED that pre-summed composition —
  splitting it into ``N read / N written`` is the atom's own change — so the citation
  pointed into ACP JSON-string commentary. The cited code did not move; it ceased to exist.
* ``dashboard/chat_runner.py:492-525`` was cited for the ``context_pct`` honesty rule and
  pointed at agent-name resolution and a redaction helper.

So this file executes the evidence block. For every citation, the range is read FROM DISK
and must still contain the token the docstring claims is there — which catches a line
shift and a rename alike, the two ways such a citation dies.

The table below is the rail's own statement of what must hold, written from the CLAIM each
citation makes, never derived from the file it checks — a floor read out of the same range
it is meant to pin would pass on any range at all.

Vacuity floors, because "every citation resolves" is the shape an empty citation set also
returns:

* ``test_the_docstring_really_carries_every_tabled_citation`` proves the docstring cites
  each one, so a deleted citation reds instead of silently shrinking the checked set.
* ``test_the_citation_set_is_exactly_the_tabled_one`` scans the docstring for the citation
  PATTERN and requires the count to match the table, so a NEW untabled citation reds
  rather than riding along unchecked.
* ``test_the_checker_discriminates`` positive-controls ``_range_contains`` two ways: a
  real repo range that genuinely lacks a token must be False, and a synthetic file whose
  token sits just outside the range must be False while the containing range is True.
