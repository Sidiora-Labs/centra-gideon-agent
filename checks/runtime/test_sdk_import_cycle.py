"""``gideon.sdk.*`` must import cleanly whichever submodule an app reaches for FIRST.

``gideon.sdk`` is the only sanctioned import path for an app bundle
(``checks/runtime/test_apps_import_boundary.py`` pins that direction), so an SDK submodule that
loads only when a SIBLING was imported before it is a boundary defect, not a style nit.

The defect this file exists to keep out: ``packages/python-client/provider_helpers.py`` imported its core
machinery from the sibling facade ``packages/python-client/model.py``, which re-exports
``register_branded_app`` from ``provider_helpers`` — a module-scope cycle. From a cold
interpreter ``import gideon.sdk.model`` worked and ``import
gideon.sdk.provider_helpers`` raised ``ImportError: cannot import name
'register_branded_app' from partially initialized module``. Nothing in the SDK chose that
winner: ``model`` merely sorts before ``provider_helpers``, and the one app that imports
both happened to name ``sdk.model`` first. An import-sorter change or one new app importing
``provider_helpers`` first would have broken every branded provider app.

Why a subprocess per order rather than two imports in one test: by the time pytest has
collected this file ``sys.modules`` already holds both modules, imported in whatever order
the rest of the suite established. A test that imports both in-process passes on the broken
tree and proves nothing. The call site that matters is a COLD interpreter, so each order
gets its own.
