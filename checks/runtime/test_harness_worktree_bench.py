"""Tests for the worktree fan-out benchmark + §1.1 measure-first gate (HARNESS-CRAFT HC-1).

The gate decides whether a whole atom (`HC-2`) gets built, so the tests that matter are the ones
that keep it from being talked into a verdict: the near-boundary band, the too-small-repo case, and
the fact that the benchmark reads the SHIPPED log line rather than its own stopwatch.

Nothing here asserts a wall-clock threshold. The end-to-end case runs a real (tiny) fan-out and
asserts SHAPE — that durations were captured at all, from real rows, and that the verdict on a
small repo refuses to generalize.
