"""Tests for derived per-template eval specs (UP-R13.3, S45).

These run against the SHIPPED library, because a derived benchmark's whole value is that it cannot
drift from the artifact — and a fixture-backed test of a derivation would let it drift into being
confidently wrong, which is the failure a hand-maintained benchmark has.

Two findings measured here, both encoded as regressions:

* A hand-rolled tree walk over guessed key names found **4 of 13** nodes in `deep-research`, because
  the engine's branch children live under `cases`/`default_case`. Every branch subtree was skipped.
* Testing for `stage` alone reported `deep-research` — which makes eight model calls via `infer` —
  as fully deterministic and needing no judge. A confident false claim about the exact property the
  eval exists to check.
