"""Version single-sourcing consistency (plan 34 T1.2, contract C3).

pyproject.toml is the single source of truth for the package version. This test
asserts the three surfaces a release exposes agree:

  1. pyproject.toml  ``[project].version``
  2. ``gideon.__version__``  (importlib.metadata when installed, literal
     fallback on a source tree)
  3. the latest release heading in ``CHANGELOG.md``  (``## [X.Y.Z] — DATE``,
     skipping the ``[Unreleased]`` section)

If any of the three drift, this test goes red — that is the guardrail that keeps
`pip show`, `gideon --version`, and the in-app "what's new" panel honest.
