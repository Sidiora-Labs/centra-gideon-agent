"""The file-watch poll runtime — what actually FIRES a `file` trigger (§3 / crit 2 — S93).

S83 shipped `file_watch.py` (globs, hashing, delta) and stopped there because there was no store to
enumerate `file` triggers from. S87 shipped the store; S92 made file triggers creatable in chat.
Measured before writing: `file_watch.changed_files` had **zero live callers**, and the tick clock
(`service.due_ids`) only surfaces triggers with a `next_fire_at` — a `file` trigger has none. So a
chat-created "when a file in ~/notes changes…" automation was present and inert: creatable, never
fired. These tests pin the runtime that closes that, and its disjointness from `ScheduleService`
(the property that makes booting it beside the cron loop safe).
