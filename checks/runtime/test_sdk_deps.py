"""Optional-SDK import guard (plan 34 T1.4).

``require_sdk`` backs the lazy imports in the hosted-provider adapters after the
``openai`` / ``anthropic`` SDKs were demoted out of core dependencies. These
tests pin the two behaviours the adapters rely on: a present SDK imports
transparently, and an absent one raises a ``MissingSDKError`` that (a) names the
exact ``pip install gideon[<extra>]`` remedy and (b) is still catchable by
existing ``except ImportError`` guards.
