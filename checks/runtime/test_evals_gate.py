"""EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE amendment E2 / ES-6 — the Loop-2 cheap gate subset.

Four clauses, and a section per clause:

1. a curated dozen FAST, assertion-heavy scenarios re-run before a proposal ships;
2. a planted regression in a candidate skill edit shows a SCORE DROP on its own proposal card
   (``{before, after, pin}``) before the user accepts;
3. gate-run cost is bounded and metered via ``SpendMeter`` — bounded meaning it STOPS;
4. a proposal with no gate run renders "ungated" honestly and NEVER blocks.

**Where these tests stop being real, and why.** Everything is the shipped code except the LLM:
the real scenario library and its manifest, the real ``load_scenario`` parser, the real
``Assertion.check``, the real subset selection, the real ``RunPin``, the real ``SpendMeter``, the
real ``candidate_files`` install rail, the real proposal store and the real inbox projection.
:class:`_ScoringMatrix` substitutes for ``run_matrix`` at the boundary
``skills_bench.bench_skill``/``ablation.run_ablation`` already make injectable, and models the
agent as a PERFECT-RECALL reader of whatever the arm staged — the strongest honest assumption, and
the one that makes a planted regression in the candidate text observable without buying tokens.
The child-side half of that seam (the arm reaching the spawn env, the staging, and the
throwaway-home refusal) is tested against the REAL code in its own section.
