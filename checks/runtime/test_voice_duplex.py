"""MULTIMODAL-IO §4 — the duplex-loop pure functions.

Every rule these functions implement is a decision the voice loop makes without
asking a model, so each is pinned here: tail-anchored phrase gating, the
three-consecutive-word echo threshold at/below/above the line, and each
individual reduction ``clean_for_speech`` performs.
