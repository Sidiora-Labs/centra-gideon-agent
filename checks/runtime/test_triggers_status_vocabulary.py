"""Every status a writer can produce is a key of the table that translates it (WV-15).

🔴 WHY THIS RAIL EXISTS. `triggers/history.py` keeps three status→outcome tables, and each one is
read with a `.get(status, <fallback>)`. The fallbacks are the honest ones — unclassifiable must not
read as a success — but a fallback is SILENT, so a status nobody mapped looks exactly like a status
somebody decided about. Measured on the parent commit: FOUR live statuses were unmapped.

* `hooks.py` → `HOOK_STATUS_TO_OUTCOME`: `skipped_incident` (the incident kill switch held the
  action BEFORE dispatch) and `launched` (a fire-and-forget background turn) both fell to
  `RAN if last_run` — "it ran and did something durable" for a hook that ran nothing.
* `gateway._record_blocked_fire` → `SCHEDULE_STATUS_TO_OUTCOME`: `blocked_injection` fell to
  `FAILED`, so a defended injection attempt read as a broken automation.
* `service._record_suppression_row` → the same table: all six `INERT_OUTCOMES` members fell to
  `FAILED`, so a quiet-hours skip read as a genuine failure.

**A REGEX SCAN FINDS ONLY THE EASY HALF.** The owner's own `grep` over `hooks.py` found
`skipped_incident` and missed `launched`, because that write is
`hook.last_status = result.outcome if result.outcome in ("launched", "queued") else "ok"` — the
status is a NAME whose values live in the `in` tuple of the condition. Two of the four real writers
have that shape and a third writes a variable pinned by an early-return guard in a different module:

    status = str(getattr(result, "outcome", "") or "")   # dashboard handler: pinned by its `elif`
    status=outcome                                       # service.py: pinned by `not in` + return

So the rail reads ASTs and infers each write's POSSIBLE VALUES from the guards that dominate it.
Deliberately a small, total inference (constant / conditional-expression / `str()` and `or`
unwrapping / local-name resolution / `in` and `not in` guards): anything it cannot resolve is a
FAILURE, not a shrug, because "I could not tell" is how the four got in.

**Two directions of drift are pinned, not one.** The value check catches a new status; the
file-census check (`test_the_writer_file_census_is_pinned`) catches a new WRITER, which no
per-file scan could see. And every writer carries vacuity floors — a scan that suddenly finds two
literals where it found nine has stopped measuring the thing it was written to measure, which is
the failure mode that makes a green rail worse than no rail.
