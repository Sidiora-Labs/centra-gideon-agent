"""App provenance + collision precedence — issues 2528 and 2514.

One fact, several representations, and the surfaces disagreed about it:

* **2528 finding 2.** The shipped git source carries bundles with the SAME NAMES as
  locally-added ones, so an unfiltered Store could render the REMOTE card for a bundle the
  user had just added from disk. The measured symptom was a card showing the git divider and
  the stale remote description ("Unattended research campaigns as an agent tool…") in place
  of the on-disk manifest's ("Ask one question and walk away…"). Those two strings are the
  before/after anchors here.
* **2528 finding 3.** ``_scan_registries``' docstring promised it skips apps "already
  surfaced by a dir-scan" while its body only knew its own ``seen`` set — and because its git
  loop ran first and shared that set, a remote pointer DROPPED the local pointer for the same
  name. The docstring was the correct spec; the body never implemented it. Findings 2 and 3
  are one defect.
* **2528 finding 1.** The bundled git source could not be turned off AND was fetched before
  any consent. Both halves are addressed: ``apps.bundled_source_enabled`` and
  ``network_source_hosts()``.
* **2514.** Settings → Tools badged every non-locked native provider ``built-in``, so apps
  installed from a user-created local source read as shipped-with-the-product.

The rails at the bottom keep the answer in ONE place, in both directions: they name the sites
that may resolve a collision or label provenance, and they carry vacuity floors so a census
that silently matches nothing cannot read as agreement.

    """No surface derives a provenance label on its own.

    ``'platform'`` and ``'first-party'`` are the two words in this vocabulary that can only
    mean provenance, so they are the census tokens. ``lib/api.ts`` is expected for
    ``'first-party'`` and only there: it declares the WIRE type, it does not render a label.

    Issue 2514 is what happens without this rail — the Tools page grew its own two-way
    labelling and the Store card silently disagreed with it.

    🔴 `pages/tools/ToolsPage.tsx` IS in the expected set below, and that is a deliberate,
    temporary widening rather than an oversight. This branch originally replaced that page's
    `providerLocked ? 'platform' : 'built-in'` binary too — the line #2514 reported. **PR #2632
    fixes it better**: it plumbs the bundle's recorded trust TIER through `InstalledApp` from the
    install gate — the only place that sees the signature, so a verified maintainer signature can
    raise `community` to `official` — and shares one string with the install dialog through
    `lib/trustTier`. Provenance ("where did these bytes come from") and tier ("how vouched-for is
    it") are two different facts, so ceding the badge to the better answer costs nothing;
    keeping both would have put two owners on one pill, which is the defect this rail exists for.

    So this branch reverted its Tools-page half. #2632 has since MERGED, and measuring what it
    actually left behind matters more than what was expected of it: `lib/trustTier` owns the TIER
    map (`builtin: 'built-in'`), but **`'platform'` stayed inline at `ToolsPage.tsx:390`** — it is
    the *locked* case, which is not a tier, so it did not fit that map.

    `pages/tools/ToolsPage.tsx` therefore stays in the expected set, and not as a placeholder:
    the word `'platform'` genuinely has two homes now, `lib/provenance.ts` here and that inline
    label there, meaning the same thing on two surfaces. That is a real if mild duplication,
    recorded rather than papered over — it is a residual of the split, not something this branch
    should fix by editing code another change just landed. If the census grows a THIRD entry, the
    rail is doing its job and the duplication has stopped being mild."""
