"""The sdist must graft the built SPA so a wheel built FROM it carries the SPA.

`python -m build` (the release job's command, and `make build`) builds the sdist
first, then builds the wheel from that sdist. setup.py's ``BuildWithWeb`` only
copies ``web/dist`` into ``gideon/static/dist`` if ``web/dist`` exists in the
build tree — so if the sdist omits ``web/dist``, the wheel-from-sdist is SPA-less
and ``scripts/verify_wheel.py`` fails (the gateway can't serve ``/``).

``MANIFEST.in``'s ``graft web/dist`` is what puts the SPA into the sdist. This test
guards that graft statically (cheap — no build), complementing the full
build-install-serve check that ``verify_wheel.py`` runs in the release pipeline.

Regression: caught 2026-07-21 during the plan-34 release dry-run — the release
pipeline had never run (no tag pushed) and `python -m build` produced a SPA-less
wheel because there was no MANIFEST.in.
