"""The one clock loop, and the double-fire the cutover had to prevent (§3 / §6 — S100).

**🔴 MEASURED BEFORE WRITING — a store-only trigger had NO firing path.** S88 shipped
`service.tick()`, S96 taught it to arm, S97 made `overlap` enforce, S98 imported the crons and S99
re-pointed the API's read. But nothing CALLED the tick:

    boot starts ScheduleService: True
    boot starts a TICK loop    : False

So a trigger created the new way (store only, as `tools.create` writes it) was invisible to
the legacy
service and unreachable by the engine that could fire it. Re-pointing the API's WRITES first — the
order the queue implied — would have produced silently dead automations.

**🔴 AND RUNNING BOTH LOOPS WOULD DOUBLE-FIRE.** Measured on the owner's real store after the boot
migration: the legacy timer would fire `['j-at','j-cron','j-every','j-seq']` and the tick would fire
`['j-at','j-cron']` — a real overlap of two live automations. So the tick becomes the SOLE clock
engine and the legacy timer is not armed (`load_without_timer`).
