"""The routing-proposal review surface — list / accept / reject (MRT-5 §6.3).

Before this, ``accept``/``reject``/``pending`` were **library functions reachable from
``tests/test_routing_proposals.py`` alone**: ``model_telemetry.py`` registered only the policy GET
and PUT, and no handler in ``dashboard/`` imported ``routing.proposals`` at all. A queue a user
cannot see or decide is not a propose-don't-write mechanism — it is a mechanism with no surface.

The shape mirrors the tree's other propose-only queue (``/api/learning/proposals``): GET the list,
POST ``{id}/accept``, DELETE ``{id}`` to dismiss. What these rails assert is the *outcome on disk*
— the table, the queue, the suppression — never merely the response body, because a handler that
answered 200 while calling nothing would pass a body-only assertion.

Isolated home via ``GIDEON_HOME`` (read per call, cached nowhere), with the redirect asserted.
Nothing here may touch the real ``~/.gideon``.
