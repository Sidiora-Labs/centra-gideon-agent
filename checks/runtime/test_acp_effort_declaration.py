"""`G21` — an effort the runtime declared it cannot honor must be refused, not persisted.

The composer already hides its effort pill when the bound agent declares no options
(``effortsForAgent`` → ``[]``), but both write paths accepted, PERSISTED and echoed back an
effort regardless: codex measured ``supported_efforts: []`` (`C2`) and a bind with
``reasoning_effort: "low"`` was still stored on the session and in its history metadata. A
control the provider cannot honor is worse than a missing one — it is a setting the user is
told took effect.

These tests drive the endpoints over a seeded DISCOVERY CACHE rather than calling the
validator directly, because the defect was never in a validator: it was that no write path
consulted the declaration at all.
