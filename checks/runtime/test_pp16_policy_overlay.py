"""PP-16 seam 4d: the sparse per-run ``SupervisorPolicy`` overlay (OWNER RULING 2).

The ruling, restated once: ``SupervisorPolicy`` had ZERO persistence while five of its knobs
(`attended`, `autopilot`, `max_cycles`, `idle_secs`, `success_criteria`) are per-INSTANCE,
user-settable settings. A template is SHARED across runs, so it structurally cannot hold a
per-instance value — the declared defaults stay where they are (``KIND_CONVERGENCE``, a
template's ``supervisor:`` block) and the run persists ONLY its overrides
(``WorkflowRun.policy_overrides``). Policy is still computed once, from defaults + overlay:
one admission core, N policies.

These tests pin the contract's two halves and their deliberate asymmetry: the WRITE seam
(``store.set_policy_overrides``) is strict — an unknown key is refused loudly while it still
has an author to complain to — and the READ side (``apply_policy_overrides``,
``WorkflowRun.from_dict``) is tolerant, because there an unknown key means a core downgraded
under a run written by a newer one, which must neither crash nor drop the key on re-save.
