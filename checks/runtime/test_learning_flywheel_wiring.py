"""The flywheel's two once-orphaned modules must keep a production importer.

`learning/accountability.py` (criterion 9's EFFECTIVE…HARMFUL verdict + auto-filed revert) and
`learning/detectors.py` (the ad-hoc→template and tier-migration verdicts) both shipped complete and
well-tested with **nothing importing them**. An AST audit on 2026-08-04 recorded that, `WF2LEA-5`
wired the first and `WF2LEA-7` the second, and both atoms are `done`.

Nothing then pinned the wiring. The failure mode is specific and silent: delete the last call site
and the modules keep passing their own unit tests forever while the behaviour they exist for — a
persistently-harmful accepted change getting reverted — simply stops happening. That is the same
"present but inert" shape the audit found in the first place, and re-entering it would look exactly
like a healthy suite.

**Why this is scoped to two named modules instead of a general rule.** The obvious generalisation is
a docs-lint check: flag any doc claiming a module has zero importers when it has some. That was
built and MEASURED across every tracked doc, and rejected — it cannot be made precise:

* a markdown **table** is one paragraph with no sentence-ending period, so the claim's scope
  swallowed every module named in the table (`gateway.py`, `history.py`, `cli_commands.py` …);
* a `**Done when:** … (module no longer has zero importers)` clause is an aspirational **negation**
  that reads identically to the claim;
* roadmap execution logs are full of **past-tense narrative** — "shipped 1,096 lines with zero
  importers in `src/`" — describing gaps that were then closed. `WORKFLOWS-V2-WORK-CONTAINERS.md`
  even labels its own block "partially superseded — see the Execution log, which wins".

Distinguishing "has none" from "had none, then we fixed it" needs tense, not pattern matching, and a
gate that flags correct history teaches people to delete the history. So the general check was
dropped and the specific, checkable fact is asserted here instead.
