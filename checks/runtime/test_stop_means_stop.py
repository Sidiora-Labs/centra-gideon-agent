"""Pressing stop stops the WORK, not just the stream (PR2-12).

THE CENSUS
==========
Measured on ``origin/main`` (df8cdb5e) before any code here changed, by reading the
call paths rather than by asserting a flag. Each row's closure has a behavioural test
below; each of those tests reds on the pre-fix line.

=========================== ============ =====================================================
layer                       reached?     evidence (pre-fix file:line)
=========================== ============ =====================================================
PR2-3 mid-turn cancel path  PARTLY       ``chat_handlers.py:1030`` sets ``session._stop_state``
                                         and ``session.py:1829`` calls ``provider.cancel``. But
                                         ``_stop_state`` had NO reader in ``chat_runner.py`` —
                                         its only readers were ``chat_handlers``,
                                         ``chat_plan.py:305`` and ``state.py:444/700``. The
                                         running turn never learned a stop had happened; it
                                         learned only that a flag it does not read was set.
in-flight model request     NO           ``runtime.py:1287-1290`` — ``cancel()`` set
                                         ``self._cancelled = True`` and returned "acked". It
                                         never called ``self._model.cancel()``, although every
                                         provider implements one (``openai.py:565``,
                                         ``anthropic.py:788``, ``acp_agent.py:605``). The loop
                                         at ``runtime.py:670-676`` then checked the flag only
                                         when the NEXT event arrived — awaited-and-discarded,
                                         which is exactly what the clause forbids.
dispatched tool subprocess  NO           ``builtin_tools.py:1512-1529`` — the bash child was
                                         reachable only by its own TIMEOUT. No registry existed
                                         for a cancel to consult, and the timeout's
                                         ``proc.kill()`` signalled one pid, so the shell's own
                                         children survived even there. The authoritative spawn
                                         census (``tests/test_spawn_ceiling_audit.py``) lists
                                         two per-turn agent-influenced async spawns a stop must
                                         reach — this one and
                                         ``sandbox_providers/none.py::_NoneHandle.exec``, which
                                         it funnels through; everything else in that file is a
                                         long-lived server (MCP), a sibling runtime (sidecar,
                                         app backend) or operator-exempt.
spawned subagent            NO           ``subagent.py`` had the machinery — ``_force_reap``
                                         (:768, kill→cancel→reap→tombstone→audit),
                                         ``cancel``/``cancel_fanout`` (:2246/:2263) and a
                                         parent-keyed enumeration (:987) — and NOTHING called
                                         any of it on a stop. ``SessionManager.stop_turn``
                                         (``session.py:1796``) cleared the queue, cancelled the
                                         provider and reset the session; the fan-out kept
                                         running, kept spending, and later delivered results
                                         into a session the user had stopped.
queued-but-unstarted calls  NO           ``runtime.py:740-743`` — ``for call in tool_calls:``
                                         with no cancel check in the body. A model turn emits a
                                         BATCH; a stop arriving mid-batch let every remaining
                                         call execute. (The sibling check at :711/:719 covers
                                         only a batch that had not STARTED.)
=========================== ============ =====================================================

DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE (recorded, not silently omitted)
----------------------------------------------------------
* **The prior turn's follow-up-chip generation** (``chat_runner.py:1447-1454``, fired at
  ``:4012``). It is fire-and-forget background spend, but it belongs to the turn that
  ALREADY COMPLETED — chips are generated after the terminal event and cancelled by the
  next dispatch. A stop on turn N killing turn N-1's chips would remove chips the user
  can still see, for ~200 tokens. Not one of the five layers the clause enumerates.
* **An ACP-backed session reports ``cancelled``, not ``stopped_by_user``.** Its stop
  reason arrives on the wire from the external agent, so the distinction cannot be made
  locally without a second bookkeeping flag — which is the defect this atom is written
  against. What the ACP path DOES satisfy already: ``cancel()`` returns "no_turn" when
  no turn is active (``acp_session_provider.py:152-153``), the in-flight turn is aborted
  by ``session/cancel`` rather than awaited, and ``stop_turn``'s hard-kill path reaches
  the agent's whole process group via ``_sigkill_session``. It cannot register the
  external agent's own tool subprocesses, and no in-process mechanism could.

Two further defects the same reading turned up, both closed here:

* **Spend was dropped.** ``runtime.py:632-639`` yielded the cancelled turn's
  ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` with no ``input_tokens``/``output_tokens``/``cost_usd``, so a stop
  between ReAct cycles threw away every token the earlier cycles burned. The other
  cancelled exit (:723) carried them, so the two exits disagreed.
* **A post-completion stop was not a no-op — it corrupted the next turn.**
  ``NativeAgentRuntime.cancel()`` returned "acked" unconditionally, so
  ``stop_turn`` (``session.py:1832``) set ``session.prev_turn_cancelled = True`` and the
  NEXT turn opened with a bogus cancelled-turn preamble (``chat_runner.py:2056-2063``).
  "Not a failure" is not the same as "no effect".

THE BAR
=======
The clause asks for "a real driven stop asserting no child process survives and no
further tool call is dispatched after the signal — not an assertion that a flag was
set". So the load-bearing tests here drive a real ``NativeAgentRuntime`` over a real
``bash`` child, stop it, and then poll the OS for the child (and its grandchild) and
count tool dispatches. Nothing below asserts ``_cancelled is True`` as a conclusion.
