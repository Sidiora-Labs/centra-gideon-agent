"""KL-14's host: the due rule, the snapshot, bounded batches, and the tick that drives it.

The three failures this host exists to prevent, each asserted rather than described:

* **N passes for N writes.** A bulk import that ran graph work inline did one pass per item,
  each superseded by the next. The watermark collapses that to one.
* **Starvation.** A rule that waits for the ingest queue to drain never fires on a pipeline
  that never drains. So dirt older than `max_staleness` runs anyway — and the age is measured
  from the FIRST unprocessed write, not the latest, because the latest is always recent
  exactly when there is most to do.
* **A swallowed write.** Clearing the watermark to "now" after a pass discards everything that
  landed while it ran, and nothing downstream could tell. `execute` clears only up to the
  snapshot it took BEFORE running.

Plus the two wiring facts that would each make the whole thing inert while looking wired: the
tick must call maintenance with `durability.auto_backup` OFF, and the in-flight probe must
actually be installed by the gateway rather than defaulting to "drained".
