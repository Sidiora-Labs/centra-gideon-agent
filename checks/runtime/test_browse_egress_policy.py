"""BROWSE-AUTOMATION §6.1 — the BROWSE egress profile.

The CDP pre-flight (§6.2, built alongside) is only as good as the policy it evaluates
against, and a policy that is not in ``_PROFILES`` fails INVISIBLY: ``get_policy`` returns
STRICT for an unknown name, so a missing registration looks like a working (merely tighter)
policy at every call site. That silent fallback is what most of this file is about.

All DNS is injected. No test here touches the resolver.
