"""Tests for worktree creation-cost instrumentation (HARNESS-CRAFT §1.1, HC-1).

**A test that only asserts "a timing line was emitted" is worthless**, because the defect this
instrumentation exists to prevent is a line whose NUMBER is wrong — a constant, a zero, a duration
that silently measures the `git ls-files` probe instead of the checkout. Every duration assertion
here is therefore two-sided:

* a LOWER bound, from a deliberate sleep injected into the git call, so a hard-coded `ms=0` reds;
* an UPPER bound, from a wall clock the test keeps around the same call, so a hard-coded large
  constant reds too.

Both bounds survive a loaded machine, because contention can only push the real duration up
(clearing the floor) and it pushes the observed wall clock up with the logged value (preserving the
ceiling). There is no fixed-threshold assertion anywhere in this file.
