"""`PP-16`'s "one adoption/reaping path", asserted at the CALL SITES.

The atom's `done_when` names six unifications; this file owns one of them. Before this,
restart-adoption was implemented twice and — the part that actually cost a user something —
*invoked* two different ways:

* the run side swept from inside `WorkflowWatchdog._poll_once`, on the first poll, with
  `_swept` flipped only after the sweep returned;
* the loop side swept from a `gateway.py` startup hook wrapped in
  `except Exception: logger.warning(...)`, awaited inline in the startup sequence, and then the
  watchdog was constructed and started regardless.

The hook shape guaranteed two defects that the poll shape cannot have, and neither is visible
from a test of the sweep's own body — which is why the rails here are about the caller:

1. **A failed sweep was lost for the life of the process.** The `except` swallowed it, the
   watchdog started anyway, and every loop the sweep should have re-armed sat persisted RUNNING
   with no worker — which a user reads as "still working" while nothing is.
2. **Startup blocked on revival.** Reviving a PLANNING loop re-runs a planner pass (a model
   call). Awaited inline, N stranded loops delayed everything after it in gateway startup.

`tests/test_loop_manager.py::TestBootSweep` covers what the loop sweep DOES; this file covers
that it is reached, reached once, reached before the poll it precedes, retried when it fails,
and reached through the one shared primitive rather than a second private one.

Every guard here carries a vacuity floor: a source scan asserts its target was found and its
anchor present before concluding anything from an absence, and each once-only / retry assertion
is paired with the opposite arrangement so a recorder that never fires cannot pass it.
