"""Detection for the model-root rail (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 Success Criterion 10).

The bound-model-deletion incident was a test that ran a real delete against a real cache
root and removed a model the developer had actually downloaded. The fix cannot be "every
test remembers to pass ``tmp_path``" — that is a convention, and the incident happened
under that convention. So the rail is structural: every entry point in
``local_models/layouts.py`` (the ONE seam all download-probing and all deletion goes
through) is wrapped for the whole suite and refuses a real, user-owned model root.

Detection lives here rather than inline in ``conftest.py`` for the reason
``real_home_guard`` gives: a guard that only ever runs against the tree it guards cannot
be distinguished from a guard that never fires. ``tests/test_local_model_root_guard.py``
drives this function against both a real root and a ``tmp_path`` one.

The rail names the roots it forbids instead of forbidding all of ``$HOME``: a developer's
checkout legitimately lives under ``$HOME`` (``~/Projects/...``), so a blanket
home-rejection would fail on a relative path in a normal clone and get switched off. What
it forbids is the set of places a real model actually lives.

    The rail is installed with ``monkeypatch.setattr(layouts, name, wrapper)``, so it

    A module-level ``from gideon.local_models.layouts import delete_all_layouts``
    binds the unwrapped function object at collection time — before the autouse fixture has
    run even once — and every later call through that alias bypasses the rail.

    Only import-TIME bindings count. A ``from ... import`` inside a function body executes
    when the function is called, i.e. after the fixture has installed the wrapper, so it
    resolves the guarded attribute and is the safe shape (it is what the production callers
    in ``dashboard/`` and ``local_models/`` already use). Imports nested inside a function
    are therefore skipped, and importing the MODULE (``from ... import layouts``) is fine at
    any depth because the lookup still happens per call.
