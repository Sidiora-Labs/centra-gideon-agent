"""Detection for the model-root rail (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 Success Criterion 10).

The bound-model-deletion incident was a test that ran a real delete against a real cache
root and removed a model the developer had actually downloaded. The fix cannot be "every
test remembers to pass ``tmp_path``" — that is a convention, and the incident happened
under that convention. So the rail is structural: every entry point in
``local_models/layouts.py`` (the ONE seam all download-probing and all deletion goes
through) is wrapped for the whole suite and refuses a real, user-owned model root.

Detection lives here rather than inline in ``conftest.py`` for the reason
``real_home_guard`` gives: a guard that only ever runs against the tree it guards cannot
be distinguished from a guard that never fires. ``tests/test_local_model_root_guard.py``
drives this function against both a real root and a ``tmp_path`` one.

The rail names the roots it forbids instead of forbidding all of ``$HOME``: a developer's
checkout legitimately lives under ``$HOME`` (``~/Projects/...``), so a blanket
home-rejection would fail on a relative path in a normal clone and get switched off. What
it forbids is the set of places a real model actually lives.

That paragraph described the intent, and for a long time the code did the opposite: bare
``REAL_HOME`` was in ``forbidden_roots()`` and ``offending_root`` matches on ``parents``, so
every absolute path under ``$HOME`` WAS rejected — a blanket home-rejection, the exact thing
the paragraph says it avoids. The visible cost was 55 spurious ``test_local_model_*``
failures on any machine whose ``TMPDIR`` lives under ``$HOME``, all of them reporting "a REAL
model root" and none of them about a model root. The bare-home entry is still here, because a
sweep of ``~`` really is never a test — but it no longer fires on a path inside the OS temp
directory. See :func:`_test_path_root`.

    🔑 WHY THE RAIL NEEDS THIS. The bare-``REAL_HOME`` entry above is a catch-all, and
    ``offending_root`` matches anything with a forbidden root in its ``parents`` — so every
    absolute path under ``$HOME`` was offending, **including pytest's own ``tmp_path``**
    whenever the OS temp directory lives under the home directory. That is not exotic: a
    harness or a user that exports ``TMPDIR=$HOME/...`` puts every ``tmp_path`` inside
    ``$HOME``, and the rail then fires on the very fixture it tells you to use. Measured on
    one such machine: ``pytest -k test_local_model`` went **55 failed / 188 passed** with
    that ``TMPDIR`` and **243 passed** with a ``TMPDIR`` outside ``$HOME`` — same tree, same
    commit, same host, and the host DID have real weights installed either way. So the
    weights were never the trigger, and the message ("called with a REAL model root") sent
    every reader looking at their model cache instead of at ``$TMPDIR``.

    A path under the temp directory is a test path *by construction*, wherever the OS chose
    to put that directory, which is why this is the right discriminator rather than a list
    of blessed prefixes.

    🪤 IT NEVER RELAXES A NAMED ROOT. The exemption applies to the bare-home catch-all only,
    and ``offending_root`` checks the named roots FIRST, so ``~/.ollama`` stays forbidden
    even if it somehow sat inside the temp directory. And when the temp directory IS the
    real home, "under tmp" would exempt the whole of ``$HOME`` and the catch-all would mean
    nothing — so this returns ``None`` and the rail keeps its original strictness.
