"""`automation_delete_all` — the scoped bulk delete (S109).

Replaces `test_cron_session_scope.py`, which tested `schedule_remove_all` — the one capability the
retired `schedule_*` aliases had that `automation_*` did not. That alias was not just a convenience:
it enforced a real access control (`jobs = [j for j in jobs if j.session_key == session_key]`), so
retiring it without carrying the scope forward would either lose the bulk operation or leave a
future author to re-add it unscoped.

**The scope changed from `session_key` to `created_by`, deliberately.** Measured before porting:
`mcp_schedule` SET `job.session_key` on add, but a row created through `tools.create` carries
`session="fresh"` (the default) and `created_by="agent"` — so a session-keyed filter would match
NOTHING for exactly the rows an agent can create. It would look identical in a diff and enforce
nothing, which is the defect class this program keeps finding. `created_by` is the ownership the
store actually records.

The two old env-var tests (`GIDEON_SESSION_KEY` capture, `GIDEON_CLI=1` admin escape)
are NOT ported: they describe a mechanism that no longer exists. The MCP dispatcher hard-codes
`created_by="agent"` rather than reading it from args, which is a stronger boundary than an env var
an agent's own process could set — asserted below.
