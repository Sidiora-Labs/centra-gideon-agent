"""The install one-liner — the front door — gets a rail, and its header stops lying.

``infrastructure/website/install.sh`` is what ``curl -fsSL https://gideon.dev/install | sh``
executes on a stranger's machine. Until now **nothing in CI ran it, linted it, or compared
it to what we serve**, while its own header claimed all three:

    # ... it is staged here under infrastructure/website/ so it is version-controlled,
    # shellcheck-clean, and CI-smoke-tested (plan 33 full.yml runs it in a bare ubuntu
    # container weekly).

MEASURED (2026-09-06): ``full.yml`` had four jobs — ``matrix``, ``audit``,
``security-corpus``, ``coverage`` — and none touched the installer; grepping
``.github/workflows/`` for ``website/install``, ``install.sh`` or
``gideon.dev/install`` returned nothing. The advertised job had never been written.
That is this repo's ninth absent-vs-declared-false: the claim of coverage was the only
artifact, and a comment nobody can execute cannot go red.

The claim also hid a real regression. Three digests, measured the same day:

    staged  infrastructure/website/install.sh   d7a852c1…  "workspace directory + timezone"
    site    public/install (mirror)     8e06a1fd…  "your name + first model provider"
    served  https://gideon.dev/install  8e06a1fd…  (identical to the site mirror)

The staged copy is AUTHORITATIVE and the served bytes are the stale ones — the opposite of
what it looks like from the site. The site's ``public/install`` has exactly one commit
(``e21bdee``, 2026-07-21), the original hand-apply; core then corrected the line in
``72e43db3b`` (PR #1642, 2026-08-18), whose own message says the installer "claimed setup
collects a name + first provider credential — it collects neither, and cannot". Confirmed
against the wizard: ``cli_setup._setup`` calls ``_setup_workspace_dir`` (step 1) and
``_setup_timezone`` (step 4) and has no name or provider prompt at all — provider binding
moved to the dashboard (``_print_dashboard_pointer``: "the dashboard owns it"). So for
three weeks gideon.dev told every new user to run a command that would do neither of
the two things it advertised.

The sync path is a HUMAN COPY (``infrastructure/website/README.md`` §1: "**To apply:** copy
``infrastructure/website/install.sh`` into the website repo"). It is not broken code — there is no
code. An unenforced instruction drifted the moment someone edited one side, which is why
the fix here is a rail and not a re-copy.

What this module asserts, and why each half exists:

* **Offline, every PR** (rides the ``test`` job; the ``lint`` job re-runs it with
  ``GIDEON_REQUIRE_INSTALL_PROOF=1`` after installing shellcheck + dash, so a missing
  linter is a RED there rather than a quiet skip): POSIX syntax, the three argument paths
  that need no network, the truncation-safe structure that makes ``curl | sh`` fail closed,
  and ``sha256(install.sh) == install.sh.sha256``.
* **The digest pin is the forcing function.** Editing the installer without updating the
  pin reds at lint speed, and the pin line in the diff is where a reviewer sees "the site
  mirror needs re-applying". Offline and network-free, so it can gate every PR — the live
  comparison cannot.
* **Header truth.** Every workflow file and job id the header names must exist, and the
  jobs must really name the installer. This is the direct rail over the defect above: the
  next person who writes "CI-smoke-tested" without writing the job gets a red.
* **Integrity of the two things it downloads** (#2582, added 2026-09-07). The one-liner makes
  two network fetches and used to verify neither. Three rails, one per fix that does not trade
  away what the script is built around: the PyPI install carries a downgrade floor derived from
  ``CHANGELOG.md`` so it cannot rot into a hand-typed constant (#2554's defect); the comment
  attached to the unverified ``astral.sh`` fetch must not claim verification AND must disclose
  the trust boundary, checked against the code either way; and the documented user verify path
  must fetch its digest from an origin OTHER than the one serving the script, which is the only
  reason that recipe is worth anything. The last one is asserted on the URL's host, because a
  same-origin digest reads identically and proves nothing.
* **Rail wiring.** ``full.yml``'s live leg must run BOTH the staged file and the served
  bytes, redirect uv's tool dirs, and report ``unproven`` (never green) when the fetch
  fails. Asserted here because the wiring is now the load-bearing part.

Parsed with a line scan rather than PyYAML, which is not a test dependency — same
convention as ``test_browse_live_legs_run_in_ci.py`` and ``test_ci_tier_enforcement.py``.
Every helper takes its text as an argument so the vacuity tests at the bottom can drive the
same functions with synthetic workflows and watch each answer change.

        no floor,  index offers only 0.1.0    exit 0   ``+ gideon==0.1.0``   silent
        `>=0.1.2`, index offers only 0.1.0    exit 1   "unsatisfiable"             loud
        `>=0.1.2`, healthy index + --upgrade  exit 0   ``+ gideon==0.1.3``   costs nothing

    So the floor forbids nothing while PyPI is honest — ``--upgrade`` still resolves to the
    newest release — and turns a yanked-and-replaced or rolled-back index from a silent old
    install into a resolver error.

    WHY THE FLOOR LAGS BY ONE RELEASE. A floor equal to ``pyproject``'s version is unsatisfiable
    for as long as it takes that release to reach PyPI and its mirrors: measured the same day,
    ``>=0.1.4`` exits 1 with "only gideon<=0.1.3 is available". That window would break
    every user's install AND ``full.yml``'s ``install-smoke``, which runs this file for real on
    every push to ``main``. The previous release has always shipped already, so a lagging floor
    can never demand a version that does not exist yet. The price is exactly one unguarded step
    — a rollback to the immediately-previous release still installs — which is the attacker's
    weakest move and the cheapest thing to give up.

    WHY THE VALUE IS NOT PINNED HERE. A hand-typed version in a shell script, checked by
    nothing, is the defect in #2554 (two copies drifted for three weeks). So the constant is
    derived: it must equal ``CHANGELOG.md``'s second-newest release heading, the repo's own
