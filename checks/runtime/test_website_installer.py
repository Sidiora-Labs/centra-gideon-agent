"""The install one-liner — the front door — gets a rail, and its header stops lying.

``deploy/website/install.sh`` is what ``curl -fsSL https://gideon.dev/install | sh``
executes on a stranger's machine. Until now **nothing in CI ran it, linted it, or compared
it to what we serve**, while its own header claimed all three:

    # ... it is staged here under deploy/website/ so it is version-controlled,
    # shellcheck-clean, and CI-smoke-tested (plan 33 full.yml runs it in a bare ubuntu
    # container weekly).

MEASURED (2026-09-06): ``full.yml`` had four jobs — ``matrix``, ``audit``,
``security-corpus``, ``coverage`` — and none touched the installer; grepping
``.github/workflows/`` for ``website/install``, ``install.sh`` or
``gideon.dev/install`` returned nothing. The advertised job had never been written.
That is this repo's ninth absent-vs-declared-false: the claim of coverage was the only
artifact, and a comment nobody can execute cannot go red.

The claim also hid a real regression. Three digests, measured the same day:

    staged  deploy/website/install.sh   d7a852c1…  "workspace directory + timezone"
    site    public/install (mirror)     8e06a1fd…  "your name + first model provider"
    served  https://gideon.dev/install  8e06a1fd…  (identical to the site mirror)

The staged copy is AUTHORITATIVE and the served bytes are the stale ones — the opposite of
what it looks like from the site. The site's ``public/install`` has exactly one commit
(``e21bdee``, 2026-07-21), the original hand-apply; core then corrected the line in
``72e43db3b`` (PR #1642, 2026-08-18), whose own message says the installer "claimed setup
collects a name + first provider credential — it collects neither, and cannot". Confirmed
against the wizard: ``cli_setup._setup`` calls ``_setup_workspace_dir`` (step 1) and
``_setup_timezone`` (step 4) and has no name or provider prompt at all — provider binding
moved to the dashboard (``_print_dashboard_pointer``: "the dashboard owns it"). So for
three weeks gideon.dev told every new user to run a command that would do neither of
the two things it advertised.

The sync path is a HUMAN COPY (``deploy/website/README.md`` §1: "**To apply:** copy
``deploy/website/install.sh`` into the website repo"). It is not broken code — there is no
code. An unenforced instruction drifted the moment someone edited one side, which is why
the fix here is a rail and not a re-copy.

What this module asserts, and why each half exists:

* **Offline, every PR** (rides the ``test`` job; the ``lint`` job re-runs it with
  ``GIDEON_REQUIRE_INSTALL_PROOF=1`` after installing shellcheck + dash, so a missing
  linter is a RED there rather than a quiet skip): POSIX syntax, the three argument paths
  that need no network, the truncation-safe structure that makes ``curl | sh`` fail closed,
  and ``sha256(install.sh) == install.sh.sha256``.
* **The digest pin is the forcing function.** Editing the installer without updating the
  pin reds at lint speed, and the pin line in the diff is where a reviewer sees "the site
  mirror needs re-applying". Offline and network-free, so it can gate every PR — the live
  comparison cannot.
* **Header truth.** Every workflow file and job id the header names must exist, and the
  jobs must really name the installer. This is the direct rail over the defect above: the
  next person who writes "CI-smoke-tested" without writing the job gets a red.
* **Rail wiring.** ``full.yml``'s live leg must run BOTH the staged file and the served
  bytes, redirect uv's tool dirs, and report ``unproven`` (never green) when the fetch
  fails. Asserted here because the wiring is now the load-bearing part.

Parsed with a line scan rather than PyYAML, which is not a test dependency — same
convention as ``test_browse_live_legs_run_in_ci.py`` and ``test_ci_tier_enforcement.py``.
Every helper takes its text as an argument so the vacuity tests at the bottom can drive the
same functions with synthetic workflows and watch each answer change.
