"""The rail for the unvalidated-id-to-path class (#455, #459, #471).

**The class.** Every JSON-file store named its records by interpolating an id into a
directory — ``_dir() / f"{record_id}.json"``. ``pathlib``'s ``/`` discards the left
operand when the right side is absolute, so that expression is a filesystem address, not
a join. Four stores were reachable from a route parameter with no check, which gave a URL
an ``rmtree`` (#455), a ``.json`` read + ``unlink`` (#471), and the same read + ``unlink``
through two proposal stores (#459).

**What this suite guards, in three layers.**

1. :mod:`gideon.core.record_ids` — the primitive: what a safe id is, and that a refusal
   is raised rather than returned.
2. The stores — each proven instance refuses a traversal id *end to end*, on a real
   filesystem, for read AND for the destructive verb. Asserting the primitive alone
   would leave "the store actually calls it" unchecked, which is the half that was
   missing before.
3. :func:`census` — a ratchet over the whole tree, so a **new** store cannot reintroduce
   the pattern. This is the layer that makes the fix durable rather than a sweep: the
   class opened because nothing could see it.

**Vacuity.** The census is a regex over source text, so a matcher that silently stops
matching would find nothing and pass — the failure mode that lets a ratchet read as
clean while guarding nothing. :data:`INTERPOLATION_SITE_FLOOR` pins the population the
census measured when it was written; if the scan finds fewer sites than that, the scan
itself is broken and the suite says so rather than going green.
