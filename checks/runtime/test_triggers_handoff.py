"""Criterion 12 clause 1: a system-scheduler write is prompted and offered the substrate (S143).

Criterion 12: *"An agent attempting `crontab -e` is prompted and offered the substrate;
`automation doctor` flags an orphaned workflow ref and a broad file-watch glob."*

🔴 **The second clause shipped in S110; the first was UNMET.** Measured before writing a line::

    is_sensitive_bash_command("crontab -e")                      -> None
    denied_command_reason("crontab -e")                          -> None
    is_sensitive_bash_command("echo '* * * * * x' | crontab -")  -> None
    is_sensitive_bash_command("launchctl load …LaunchAgents/x.plist") -> None
    is_sensitive_bash_command("systemctl --user enable t.timer") -> None

So an agent could install a cron in the user's real crontab and **nothing said a word**. The one
`crontab` pattern that did exist lives in `supply_chain.py`'s app-bundle scanner, which reads app
FILES at install time — a surface an agent's own bash call never touches. Easy to mistake for
coverage; `grep` finds the word, and the criterion looks met.

Why it matters: a job in the system crontab is invisible to everything the substrate provides — no
ledger row, no autopause, no quiet window, no capability fence, no kill switch — and it survives
uninstall. It is the one way for unattended work to escape the substrate entirely.

**Both dispatch seams are asserted here.** The native bash tool AND the ACP `hooks.on_tool_call`
path, because a control on one of two seams is a control the other silently skips — exactly how the
`web_watch` screen gap (S134) opened.
