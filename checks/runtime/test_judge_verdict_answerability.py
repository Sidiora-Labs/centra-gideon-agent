"""`ES-12` — judge verdict integrity: verdicts must be answerable from the evidence shown.

The T04 gap: a judge could PASS while citing evidence it was never shown, and nothing
downstream could tell — the verdict asserted a conclusion the presented evidence cannot
support. The contract now grounds every citation against the exact slice the caller showed
the judge (verbatim-span or a declared observation command), flags partial fabrication,
rejects a PASS resting ONLY on fabricated citations, and stamps each verdict with the
sha256 identity of the slice it judged.

The T04 regression fixture is `test_t04_fixture_*`: the exact fabricated-PASS shape from
the draft, asserted to have been ACCEPTED by the pre-`ES-12` contract surface (no
answerability signal existed) and REJECTED now — reproduce, then pass.
