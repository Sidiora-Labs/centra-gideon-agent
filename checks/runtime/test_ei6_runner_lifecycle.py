"""EI-6 SC5 — durable-session reattach, dead-only tombstoning, and runner leases.

**What this suite can and cannot prove, stated up front.** ``tmux`` is not installed on the
machine this was written on, so a real tmux daemon was never exercised. Rather than skip the
clause (a skipped surface reads exactly like a passing one) the aliveness question is answered
by REAL OS PROCESS STATE through a shim binary literally named ``tmux``, placed on ``PATH``,
which answers ``has-session`` and ``list-panes`` by calling ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` on a process
this suite actually spawned.

So the chain under test is real except for one link:

* the worker is a real ``subprocess.Popen`` child, not a fixture flag;
* its aliveness is the kernel's answer, not a boolean someone set;
* the production code's argv, its subprocess spawn, and its exit-code contract
  (``has-session`` exits 0 for present / non-zero for absent) are executed verbatim;
* only the tmux *daemon* is substituted, by something that defers to the OS.

What that leaves unproven: that a real tmux server reports the same exit codes for these
argv (it does, by documented contract, but this suite did not observe it), and that a worker
placed inside a real tmux session survives a real gateway kill.

The dead leg is reaped with ``wait()`` before it is probed, deliberately. A killed-but-unreaped
child is a ZOMBIE, and ``kill(pid, 0)`` succeeds on a zombie — so a "dead" leg that skipped the
reap would still report alive and the control would silently prove nothing.
