"""ONE loop-status vocabulary, backend to frontend (PP-16).

🔴 WHY THIS RAIL EXISTS. A loop's lifecycle status is one backend enum (``loop.loop:LoopStatus``)
and the frontend narrated it from TWO tables that had drifted word-for-word and tone-for-tone:

* ``web/src/lib/loopStatus.ts`` — read by the Code list, the in-chat SDLC progress card and the
  Projects linked-work rows: ``stagnant`` → "Stalled", ``intake`` → "Analyzing",
  ``complete`` → "Complete", ``running`` → primary, ``complete`` → ok.
* ``web/src/pages/loops/loopStatusMeta.ts`` — read by the Loops list and the dashboard Active Work
  widget: ``stagnant`` → "Stagnant", ``intake`` → "Intake", ``complete`` → "Completed",
  ``running`` → ok, ``complete`` → primary, ``paused`` → warn.

So the same loop said "Stalled" on one surface and "Stagnant" on the next, and green meant
"running" on one and "finished" on the other. The first file's own header comment claimed it had
already fixed exactly that drift — it consolidated three per-page maps, and then a fourth shipped
beside it. And ``pages/workflows/terminalSuccessLabel.test.ts``, the rail that locked "a finished
run is *Completed* everywhere", could not see the violation: it named the other two registries by
path and matched a ``{ label: ... }`` shape that ``lib/loopStatus.ts`` did not use.

PP-16 retires the second table. This is the cross-tier half of that: the surviving registry must
cover the backend enum EXACTLY, and no second one may reappear.

**Both drift directions are pinned.** A new ``LoopStatus`` member with no frontend word reds this,
and a stale frontend key naming a status the backend cannot produce reds it too — a status the
frontend renders but the backend never sends is dead vocabulary a reader will trust.

**Every scan carries a vacuity floor.** A regex that stops matching reads as a clean pass forever,
so each census asserts its positive control (the surviving registry) still matches before it
concludes that nothing else does.

#: Also deliberately NOT counted: a table that PROJECTS a loop status into a different closed
#: vocabulary. `lib/useAgentActivity.ts`'s `LOOP_STATE` maps the 12 `UnifiedLoopStatus` members
#: onto the 5 `AgentActivityState` members (`working`/`needs_input`/`waiting_approval`/`idle`/
#: `error`) for the ambient worlds — it holds no label and no tone, so it cannot produce the
#: "Stalled vs Stagnant" or two-meanings-of-green drift this census exists to prevent. Same
#: reasoning as the rank-order exemption above: a projection is not a words-and-tones table.
