"""The lossless cron migration (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §2/§6 — S66).

The step that cannot be redone cheaply. Once `crons.json` is converted
and the legacy service retired,
a dropped field is a behaviour nobody can recover without the user's old file — and the failures are
quiet: a lost `skip_dates` fires on a holiday, a lost `strict_schedule`
catches up when the author said
not to, a lost `timezone` runs at the wrong hour for half the year.

**Driven against a real file, not a hand-written fixture.** The tests
below build jobs with the actual
shipped `ScheduleService` and let IT write `crons.json`, then migrate
what is on disk. A fixture I wrote
myself would encode my belief about the format; the service encodes the format.

**Two measurements that changed the implementation.**

* `ScheduleService._save` persists 33 of the dataclass's 35 fields — **`dry_run` and `last_outcome`
  never reach disk.** They are runtime-only, so the migration cannot read
  them and must not claim to.
  `NEVER_PERSISTED` records that, or the audit would lie in the other direction.
* `ScheduleDefinition`'s three kinds do NOT line up with the trigger
clock's three. Legacy `every` has
  no equivalent, and mapping it onto `at` — the tempting shape match, since both carry one number —
  would turn every recurring interval job into a one-shot that fires once and dies.
