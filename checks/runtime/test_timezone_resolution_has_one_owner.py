"""Rail: exactly ONE module in the core resolves a wall-clock timezone (#2520).

The defect the issue filed was a wrong default. The COST it named was different: "every
trigger author now has to rediscover this pattern independently", and one first-party
surface already had. Derived by AST + interprocedural taint over `src/gideon/` (a
fixpoint over "which functions RETURN a tzinfo or a zone name", not a grep for one name),
the pre-fix population was **seven** hand-rolled resolvers that did not agree:

    src/gideon/triggers/arm.py:44                _trigger_tz()      → UTC
    src/gideon/schedule.py:432                   get_local_tz()     → UTC   (!)
    src/gideon/schedule.py:445                   _job_tz()          → UTC
    src/gideon/triggers/calendar.py:564          _resolve_zone()    → server-local
    src/gideon/knowledge/research_reports.py:396 _report_tz()       → UTC
    src/gideon/knowledge/report_schedules.py:76  _effective_tz()    → "" (= UTC)
    src/gideon/cli_setup.py:292      _detect_system_timezone()      → own /etc reader

The last two are why a name-based search is not enough: neither constructs a `ZoneInfo`, so
neither appears in `grep -rn ZoneInfo`. `_effective_tz` was found by the taint fixpoint (it
returns a zone NAME) and `_detect_system_timezone` by the `/etc/localtime` clause below.

So this rail is not "the default is right" — that is
`test_timed_trigger_timezone_default.py`. This one reds when a NEW site learns to resolve a
timezone on its own. There are exactly three ways to obtain a machine or IANA zone in this
codebase, and all three are checked:

  1. constructing a `ZoneInfo` — the only stdlib route to an IANA zone;
  2. reading `/etc/localtime` or `/etc/timezone` — the only route to the machine's zone;
  3. `time.tzname` — banned outright, everywhere, including the owner: it yields
     abbreviations (`PDT`, `CEST`) that `ZoneInfo` rejects, and reaching for it is the
     specific wrong turn the issue paid to discover.

**Vacuity floor, both directions**, because a scanner that silently matches nothing is a
green rail that checks nothing:

  * `test_the_rail_reds_on_*` plants each of the three shapes in a temp tree and asserts the
    scanner reports it. Three canaries, one per clause.
  * `test_the_scan_is_not_vacuous_*` asserts an absolute lower bound on what the scan finds,
    cross-checked against a SECOND mechanism (plain substring counting over the file bytes)
    that shares no code with the AST walk that derives the expected set.

The scanner matches the honest second implementation, not an adversarial one: a resolver that
writes `"/etc/" + "localtime"` or reaches `ZoneInfo` through `getattr` will slip past. That is
the right bar — the failure this exists to prevent is a well-meaning author solving the
problem again, not someone hiding it.
