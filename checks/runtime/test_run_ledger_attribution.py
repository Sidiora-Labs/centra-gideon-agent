"""TSE2-1 (MULTI-TENANCY-ENTITY): run-ledger attribution — `owner_username` + `origin_harness`.

The audit reserved this at design time because the run store is cheap to touch now and expensive
to retrofit once it federates: a run record must be able to say WHO authored it and WHICH machine
minted it, so a shared/synced run store attributes a run rather than silently folding it into "the"
owner's. The field is added where the schema lives (`WorkflowRun` + the SQLite row), stamped from
the SHIPPED primitives — `identity.current_username()` and `durability.shards.machine_id` — never a
parallel mechanism, and carried onto the opening run-journal row and the mutation ledger row.

Two axes must not be conflated, and these tests hold the line: `actor` on a mutation row is the
KIND of change (`chat`/`engine`), untouched here; `owner_username`/`origin_harness` are WHO and
WHICH-machine. Every attribution field is optional and empty degrades to today's behaviour — a run
with no recorded owner is the owner's (`belongs_to` mirrors `Task.belongs_to`), so a solo install is
byte-identical but for two empty defaults.

The non-cheatable bar is the last test: a foreign-authored run stays VISIBLE in run history with its
own author, yet is EXCLUDED from the owner's "my runs" count. It asserts both a known-true (the
owner's run is counted) and a known-false (the foreign run is not) case, so neither "count
everything" nor "count nothing" satisfies it. On pre-plan code — no `owner_username`, no
`belongs_to` — it cannot even run.
