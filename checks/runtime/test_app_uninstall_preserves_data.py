"""The middle removal rung: uninstall removes the app and KEEPS its ``data/`` (#2541).

Before this, ``app_manager``'s removal ladder had two rungs and a hole between them:
``uninstall()`` is DEACTIVATE (nothing leaves disk) and ``force_uninstall()`` removes
everything including ``data/``. A user who wanted the app gone but the notes they wrote
with it kept had no operation at all, and the force-uninstall confirm dialog told them to
"use Uninstall instead" — a control that did not exist.

These tests drive the REAL cycle the roadmap gate (`PEP-16`) asks about rather than
asserting on a stub: a fixture app is installed into an isolated home, data is written
**through the app's own tool** (a real subprocess that writes markdown and makes real
``git`` commits into ``data/``), the new uninstall runs, and the assertions are that the
app is gone AND every note plus its git history survived — then it is reinstalled and the
notes are read back.

Both directions are proven, because a preservation test that only shows preservation
cannot tell a working preserve from a broken wipe:

* the preserving rung PRESERVES — notes, git history, an empty ``data/``, absence;
* the wiping rung STILL WIPES — ``force_uninstall`` takes ``data/`` with it, takes a
  parked copy from an earlier keep-data uninstall with it, and a reinstall after it
  comes back empty.
