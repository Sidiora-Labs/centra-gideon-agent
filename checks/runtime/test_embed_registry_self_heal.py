"""A config-defined embedding provider must resolve outside the gateway boot path (#47).

Config `providers[]` entries are replayed into the process-wide LLM registry by
``sync_entries_from_config()``, which ONLY ``dashboard/server.py`` calls. Any other
entry point — a CLI command, a worker, a background pass that runs before boot
finishes — saw an empty ``_entries`` and every embed attempt returned ``None``
*silently*: knowledge items sat at ``processing_status: "processing"`` with
``has_embedding: false`` forever, and memory could not embed at all.

Chat never hit this because chat resolution runs after boot. The knowledge/memory
embed pass does, which is why it looked like "embedding is broken" rather than
"the registry wasn't populated".
