"""S75 — the Proposal Inbox and the accept gate (§6.1 / §7).

§7's criterion 1 has two halves: one inbox across all six kinds with provenance, evidence manifests
and risk-tier metadata — **and the model cannot accept its own proposals under any trust mode**. The
second is load-bearing, and `test_an_agent_can_never_accept` is its regression.

**Measured before writing.** `proposals.accept()` takes `(pid, installer=...)` and NOTHING knows
WHO is accepting — no actor, no caller, no trust check. The invariant held only because no agent
tool happened to call it: an ABSENCE, not a control. One new MCP tool would have removed it silently
with no test failing.
