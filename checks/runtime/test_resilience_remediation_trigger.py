"""PR2-8 — the remediation engine as ONE adaptive-clock trigger, and its runs in the digest.

The atom's `done_when` has two clauses and this file covers both, each as a CALL-SITE assertion
rather than a config one:

1. **"runs as ONE adaptive-clock trigger (`created_by: system`) on the Automations page instead of
   the heartbeat job."** A trigger row that exists in storage but never renders is this repo's
   recurring defect, so the listing is asserted through `api_triggers`' real projection — the same
   function the page's `api.schedules()` fetch calls — and the heartbeat half is asserted by DRIVING
   `_beat` with the engine's own entry point instrumented, which fails if anyone re-adds a heartbeat
   driver. `tests/../web/src/pages/triggers/remediationTriggerListed.test.tsx` is the paired
   front-end half: it fails if the row stops rendering.

2. **"its runs are picked up by the runs-inbox learned-overnight digest like any other run."**
   Driven through `GatewayOrchestrator._deliver_fire_outcome` — the single point every store-backed
   fire reports from — into a real `DashboardState.notify`, so the rule resolution
   (`resolve_rule_for_legacy` → mode) is the shipped one. A hand-built note in the queue would prove
   nothing: it would skip the very selection this clause is about. Each pickup assertion is paired
   with a run that must NOT be picked up, so a queue that swallowed everything would fail.
