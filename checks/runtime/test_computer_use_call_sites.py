"""`DCU-2`'s missing half: the three screens exist, and NOTHING in ``src/`` calls them yet.

`DCU-2` ships the decisions (``policy.check_app``, ``policy.check_input_target``) and the
audit (``gate.require_computer_use``). Every one of them provably refuses/records when
called — ``test_computer_use_policy.py`` and ``test_computer_use_gate.py`` drive them
directly. But a screen is only a screen where something consults it, and on ``main`` the
dispatch chain those three sit in **does not exist**: `DCU-3` owns the macOS driver and
`DCU-4` owns ``service.py``'s in-gateway chain and the ``computer_*`` tool surface. So the
atom's third clause — *"every attempt, allowed or refused, produces a SEL record"* — is
today a property of a function nobody calls, which is the exact defect shape this codebase
keeps rediscovering: a control that is present, correct, tested, and inert.

**Why this file exists rather than a chain rail.** `DCU-1` armed the analogous rail for
step 1 (``test_every_computer_use_entry_point_guards_first``) by requiring every
``computer_*`` function in the package to call the keystone FIRST. The equivalent for steps
2/4/5 cannot be written yet without dictating a shape: `DCU-4`'s scope puts the chain in a
central ``service.py`` dispatch, not in each tool, so a per-tool "must call
``check_input_target``" rail would prescribe the wrong composition and a central-dispatch
rail has no dispatch to bind to. Choosing between those is `DCU-4`'s call, not this file's.

**What this file does instead**, which needs no such choice: it says the inertness OUT LOUD
and makes it self-announcing. The census below reds the moment the first production caller
appears — at which point the author must come back and assert the CALL SITE (that the
refusal really fires from the driving path, and that a SEL row is written on the allowed
path as well as the refused one), not merely that the mechanism works in isolation.

**This is invisible to every other gate on main, which is why it is written down here.**
``inert-surface-baseline.json`` censuses five declared-surface kinds — config keys, enum
members, trigger kinds, ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` entries and SDK exports — so a *module-level*
function with no importer is outside its vocabulary entirely (measured: zero occurrences of
``computer_use`` in that baseline). ``test_the_packages_public_surface_is_pinned`` pins the
three names as public API but says nothing about anyone calling them.

**AST, not a text scan.** ``policy.py``'s own module docstring names all three functions,
and ``gate.py``'s names two of them, so a ``grep``-shaped rail would count prose as call
sites and read as "already wired" today — the false-clean this repo has recorded before.
Only ``ast.Call`` nodes count here, and
:func:`test_the_scanner_does_not_count_prose_as_a_call_site` is the proof of that.

    Measured on ``origin/main``: ZERO. ``check_app``, ``check_input_target`` and

    the chain that would call them is `DCU-4`'s deliverable and the driver is `DCU-3`'s —

    by a SEL row: ``policy`` raises without recording, by design, because ``gate`` is a
    separate step a caller must remember.

    **When this reds, do not just bump the number.** Add, in the same change, a test that
    asserts the CALL SITE for whichever screen gained a caller:

    * a non-allowlisted app refused *through the dispatch path*, not by calling
      ``check_app`` directly;
    * a type/set-value into a secure field refused the same way;
    * a SEL row written on the ALLOWED path **and** on the refused path — asserted
