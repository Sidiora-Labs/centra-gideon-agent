"""CA-7 V3 — the tunnel clauses, driven over a REAL TLS tunnel.

`CA-7`'s build half (commit `57102588`) is merged: `ws.py:_check_ws_origin` admits an
`Origin`-less upgrade when the authorizing session carries a paired `device` row, and
`tests/test_ca7_remote_wss_auth.py` pins that admission and its fail-closed edges. What that
suite does NOT do is *transport*: it drives `aiohttp`'s in-process test client straight at the
app, so no socket ever carried TLS, nothing sat between client and gateway, and no connection
was ever killed mid-session. The atom's `done_when` is written as an **observation** over a
tunnel, which is why the atom stayed `todo`. This file closes as much of that as is honestly
closable on one machine.

**WHAT IS REAL HERE** — stated up front, because an overclaim would be worse than a gap:

* A real, separate TLS-terminating relay (:class:`_TlsTunnel`) listens on its own port, presents
  a real certificate, and forwards to the gateway. It injects ``X-Real-IP`` on the request head
  exactly as a reverse proxy does. The client dials ``wss://`` and completes a real TLS
  handshake; `aiohttp` verifies the cert against the CA. **The client never holds the gateway's
  address** — its only peer is the tunnel.
* The gateway side is the real `/api/ws` route behind the real `token_auth` middleware, so the
  admission under observation is the shipped one, not a stand-in.
* Killing the tunnel really destroys live sockets, and the reconnect is a genuinely new TLS
  handshake against a newly bound port.
* Authentication is **cookie-borne**, which is what the companion guide mandates for a native
  client and what no existing `CA-7` test exercised — every test in the older file authenticates
  with `?token=`, the one mechanism the guide forbids.

**WHAT IS NOT REAL** — the honest gap, unchanged from the atom's log:

* The tunnel is **loopback**. There is no public DNS name, no publicly-trusted CA, and no
  internet path. The topology (client → owner's tunnel → gateway, TLS terminated at the tunnel)
  is real; the *remoteness* is not. A clause needing a genuinely remote peer is still unobserved.
* The client is a native `aiohttp` client, not a shipped desktop/mobile shell. It is native in
  the sense the admission cares about: it has no document, so it sends no `Origin`.
  (Corrected by `CA-8`: this used to add "the repo still has none (`desktop/main.js` holds one
  `backendUrl`)". The shell now holds two urls — `localGatewayUrl` for the gateway it spawned and
  `activeUrl` for a paired one — and connects to gateways it did not spawn. It is still not the
  client under test here, and deliberately never will be for THIS admission path: the desktop shell
  **hosts the SPA in a WebView**, so the socket is opened by the page, origin-relative, and the
  shell therefore sends an `Origin` like any browser. The `Origin`-less branch is for a client that
  talks to the gateway directly instead of hosting its UI.)
* "Degrades gracefully" is observed as *the socket dies promptly and the session reconnects*.
  The SPA's backoff ladder is reused by reference, not re-driven here.

**THE VACUITY HAZARD, AND WHY IT IS NOT VACUOUS.** `check_origin` trusts an `Origin`-less
request outright when the peer is loopback (`origin.py:420-424`). Over a loopback tunnel the
gateway's peer *is* 127.0.0.1, so every test below would pass with the CA-7 device branch
deleted. `is_loopback` is therefore forced False for the duration of every handshake, and
:func:`test_the_device_session_is_what_admitted_it_not_the_tunnels_loopback_peer` proves the
admission collapses to 403 the moment the device row is removed.

    own websocket writer). Both are prompt notifications and both are acceptable;
    a shell that only catches the message shape would surface the raise as an unhandled error.
    `asyncio.TimeoutError` is deliberately NOT caught — a timeout here IS the hang under test.
