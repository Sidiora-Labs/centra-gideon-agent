"""The Decision Journal's HTTP read surface (PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT §2.5/§5.3, atom PA-6).

`PA-4`'s execution log recorded that `PA-6` was "frontend-only" because ``calibration()``
already computes the strip. It is not: ``decision_list``/``decision_resolve`` are *chat tools*,
and nothing served a decision or a calibration bucket over HTTP, so the view had no read path at
all. This file covers the one route that closes that — and, more importantly, the property that
made a route necessary rather than letting the browser aggregate raw rows itself:

**there is exactly ONE definition of how well-calibrated the user is.** Every assertion below
compares the payload to ``decisions.calibration``/``decisions.list_decisions`` *by value*, so a
handler that recomputed anything — a filtered aggregate, a rate rounded differently, a
``count_honest`` derived against a locally-spelled ten — goes red instead of quietly giving a
second answer to the question the strip asks.

Stores are ``tmp_path``: ``decisions`` takes ``store`` as a parameter, and the ONE path that
reaches for a live singleton (``_knowledge_store(None)``, which the handler necessarily uses) is
redirected here with an assertion that the redirect actually took — a patch that missed would
otherwise read the developer's real ``~/.gideon`` and still pass.
