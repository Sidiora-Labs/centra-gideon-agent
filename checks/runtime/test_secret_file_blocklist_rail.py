"""#354 — the files surface must refuse every secret Gideon itself writes.

**The bug was not a missing string; it was a hand-maintained list.** ``session_key`` — the HMAC
key that signs every dashboard session token — was documented as "the signing key" in
``dashboard/session_store.py`` and named a secret in ``security.py``, and the dashboard
blocklist still read it out through ``GET /api/file-read``. It had drifted once already
(``sel_hmac.key``/``.local_secret``/``telemetry_salt`` were added after #643), which is the
tell: a list that must be remembered is a list that will be forgotten.

So this file does not assert "``session_key`` is blocked". Any test that spells the names out
is a FOURTH hand-copy of them and cannot catch the next omission — it only knows what its own
author remembered, which is the same failure one level up. Instead it derives the names from
their real sources and asserts coverage:

1. :class:`TestAuthLayerFilesAreProtected` asks the AUTH LAYER where it keeps its files — every
   zero-arg ``*_path()`` helper the auth modules export — and requires each to be refused. This
   is the rail the issue asked for ("a test asserting every file the auth layer writes is
   blocklisted"), and it is what found the ``auth/`` directory: ``auth/credentials.json`` (the
   argon2id password hash), ``auth/enroll_codes.json`` and ``auth/pair_codes.json`` (live
   redeemable device codes) all answered ``200`` with their contents — ``session_key``'s exact
   omission, one directory over.
2. :class:`TestDeclarationIsTheOnlySource` requires the guard to be DERIVED: a synthetic name
   added to the declaration in ``security.py`` must be refused by the dashboard without any
   edit to ``handlers/files.py``. That is the property that makes the omission structurally
   impossible instead of fixed once.
3. :class:`TestRefusalsAreFailClosedAndQuiet` covers the two routes at the wire, including the
   error-shape half: a refusal must not echo the resolved absolute path or any file content.
4. :class:`TestVacuityFloor` keeps the whole file honest — an ordinary file must still be
   readable and an ordinary in-root path must still be revealable, so "refuse everything"
   cannot pass as a fix.
