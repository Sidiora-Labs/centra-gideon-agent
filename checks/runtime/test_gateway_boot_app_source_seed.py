"""First-run seeding of the curated app registry, railed on the REAL boot path.

ET-4 ships ``https://github.com/Gideon/registry.git`` as a *seeded* default git
source: the gateway writes it into ``apps/app-sources.json`` once, as an ordinary
REMOVABLE row, alongside a ``"seeded": ["registry"]`` marker whose job is to keep a
user's removal from being undone by the next start.

``tests/test_app_catalog.py`` rails the SEEDER — every assertion there calls
``catalog.seed_default_git_sources()`` itself. That leaves the WIRE unrailed: deleting
``app.on_startup.append(_app_sources_seed_startup)`` from ``dashboard/server.py`` keeps
that entire suite green while first-run seeding silently never happens (measured — see
the module docstring of that file for the seeder's own rails, and this file's history
for the falsification). A seeder nobody calls is an inert control, and the done-clause
is "seeds into app-sources.json on first run", not "a helper exists". So these rails
boot the real gateway and assert what the user's Store actually reads — over HTTP, from
the file — never by calling the seeder.

Isolation: ``GIDEON_HOME`` is the seam, because ``config_dir()`` reads the env var
on every call and so redirects BOTH bindings at once — ``config/loader.py``'s and the
one ``config/__init__.py`` binds at import. Patching the loader attribute instead misses
the import-bound copy. The redirect is asserted through both bindings before any boot
runs, or these rails would write the real ``~/.gideon``.
