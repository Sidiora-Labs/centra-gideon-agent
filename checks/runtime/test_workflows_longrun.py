"""Tests for the long-run watcher mechanics (KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS §4).

Nearly every failure this module guards against is INVISIBLE: nothing errors, the watcher keeps
running, and it just costs more every cycle or quietly stops noticing things. So the tests here
lean on measuring behaviour — what a 60-item sibling read actually yields, what the second cycle
actually sees — rather than asserting that a function exists.
