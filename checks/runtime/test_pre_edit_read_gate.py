"""AG-14: the pre-edit read gate at the native write seam.

Two kinds of test here, deliberately:

* **behaviour** — a modifying write is admitted only when the target's current content was
  actually observed, and refused with the read to do first when it was not; and
* **the bypass rail** — every filesystem write in ``builtin_tools`` is covered by the ONE
  gate at the seam, so a new write path cannot ship uncovered (the
  fixing-the-wrapper-misses-a-raw-child defect). The rail carries a vacuity assertion:
  if its scan matches no write paths at all it FAILS rather than reading clean.
