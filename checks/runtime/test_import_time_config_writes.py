"""Importing a module must never WRITE the config — the leak no fixture can reach.

`checks/runtime/conftest.py::_isolate_real_home_writers` redirects the two home-resolution seams and
re-points every module-level binding of `config_dir` it can find in `sys.modules`. Its own
docstring names the shape it cannot cover: *"a home resolved into a module-level constant at
import time … If a new leak appears here, check for that shape first."*

This is that check, promoted from a docstring warning to an executable rail, after a **fourth**
instance of the shape reached the real home on CI:

    checks/runtime/test_aap9_project_stamping.py:27  import gideon.integrations.mcp_artifacts
      → mcp_artifacts.py:14                 from gideon.integrations.mcp_core import ...
        → mcp_core.py:111                   _API = _resolve_api_base()      # module level
          → mcp_core.py:106                 cfg = AppConfig.load()
            → config/loader.py:~5657        cfg.save()                      # migration write-back
              → atomic_write(config_path()) # the REAL ~/.gideon/config.json

Two things made that maximally hard to catch, and both are why the rail below is shaped the
way it is:

* **It ran during pytest COLLECTION**, in the `importtestmodule` path — before a single
  fixture exists. No amount of fixture work can intercept it.
* **`AppConfig.load()` is not a pure read.** It performs a migration write-back, so a module
  that merely *reads* config at import time can rewrite the user's file. `load()` also copies
  the old file aside with `shutil.copy2`, which **preserves mtime**, so the `.bak` looks older
  than the run and the real-home rail reports only ONE changed entry — hiding half the
  evidence.

It was invisible on developer machines for a third reason: the write only happens when
`config.json` exists AND needs migration. A developer's own config is already migrated, so
`needs_migration` is False and nothing is written. A fresh CI runner's is not.

Deliberately a SUBPROCESS test. The import must be the module's *first* in that interpreter or
there is nothing to observe (`sys.modules` makes a re-import a no-op), and the whole point is
that this must hold with no conftest fixture in play. That also makes it deterministic —
it does not depend on xdist worker assignment or on which test happened to import first,
which is exactly how the original defect hid.
