"""A credential-shaped setting in a first-party app manifest must be ``x-meta.sensitive``.

Core masks a provider/app setting on the wire only when the manifest marks it
``x-meta.sensitive``. That flag is the sole input to every masker core has — verified by
reading them: :func:`gideon.dashboard.handlers.apps._sensitive_field_names` (which
feeds ``_mask_secret_config``, whose own comment names the consequence, "leaving the
backend in cleartext on every config-panel open (#43)"),
:func:`gideon.config.validation._is_sensitive_path`, and the frontend's
``pages/apps/appConfigForm.tsx``, which decides ``type="password"`` and the write-only
blank-input behaviour from the same flag. So a manifest that declares an ``api_key``
*without* it gets no masking anywhere, on any route: the maskers are correct and the
**data** is wrong. Nothing objected to that before this rail.

Measured 2026-09-06 over the 54 first-party manifests: 25 credential-shaped fields carried
the flag and **one did not** — ``openai-tools.api_key``. That one matters more than its
count suggests, because ``openai-tools`` is one of only two apps a cold
Settings → Providers load actually fetches an instance config for, which made it the single
browser-reachable cleartext credential in the set.

**What this rail can and cannot prove — stated up front, because its sibling's history is a
warning.** ``tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py`` had *never run anywhere* (issue 1777): it
resolved a path that was always absent and module-skipped, so the one lint enforcing the
provider-agnostic-core tenet reported "skipped" on every run while a violation could have
landed at any time. This rail reuses that file's :func:`_app_roots` so it inherits the fixed
resolution, **including the bundled tree that is present in every clone**.

But the bundled tree carries **zero** credential-shaped fields (measured: 30 manifests, 0
fields — they are all internal action/tool apps with no external provider). So the two halves
below do different jobs and both are required:

* the **planted-fixture** tests prove the *detector* works, deterministically, in any clone;
* the **corpus** test proves the *real manifests* are clean, and gets stronger wherever a
  first-party apps clone is actually present.

Consequently this file asserts ``manifests_scanned > 0`` (satisfiable everywhere — the bundled
tree guarantees it, so a broken resolver or renamed tree reds). It deliberately does **not**
assert ``marked_fields > 0``, which would red every clean CI clone. The planted fixtures carry
that weight instead.

**Corrected 2026-09-07 — the earlier version of this note was not enough.** It said the corpus
arm "gets stronger wherever a first-party apps clone is present", which is true and was being
read as sufficient. It is not: with no clone resolved, that arm examined **zero** credential
fields and reported a pass, which is indistinguishable from a clean catalog. It now SKIPS in
that case, naming what was not checked. And because ``_app_roots()`` resolves the clone as a
sibling of this checkout, a CI runner never has one — so **core structurally cannot gate the
apps repository at all.** The enforcing gate is ``GideonApps``'
``.github/scripts/check_settings_schema_posture.py`` rule 4, in the CI of the repo that owns
the manifests. What lives here is the detector plus its planted floors.
