"""EA-6 — the local A/B replay harness's honesty rails.

Six clauses in the atom, and each one names a specific way a measurement surface lies. The
tests below are organized by clause rather than by function, because the risk here is not that
an arithmetic helper returns the wrong float — it is that a card tells a reviewer something
nobody measured, or that evidence quietly becomes a veto.

Every positive leg has a VACUITY PARTNER that stays green under the mutation that reddens its
sibling. The pairs are named in each class docstring: a suite where the mutated and unmutated
runs report the same count has proved nothing about which line it was reading.
