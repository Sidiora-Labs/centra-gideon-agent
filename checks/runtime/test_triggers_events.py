"""S67 — lifecycle-event dormancy + trigger-kind API parity (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §2/§7).

The dormancy list is a REVIEWED CONSTANT, not a scan, because every automatic derivation measured
wrong (see `triggers/events.py`'s docstring: docstring mentions, import blocks, and a real fire that
carries no constant reference). These tests are the guard that keeps a hand-maintained list honest —
`test_dormancy_reconciles_with_the_catalog` is the one that fails when someone wires an event and
forgets to update the list, which is the failure mode that would otherwise tell a user their working
hook is dead.
