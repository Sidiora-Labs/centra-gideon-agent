"""A tile-widget action re-fires the tile's bound workflow — and ONLY inside its frozen set.

AMBIENT-SURFACES §5.4 / atom AS-6, third routing case: *"tile widgets → actions run through
the tile's bound workflow (re-fire with bound args), subject to the trigger's frozen
capability set — a rendered button can never introduce actions the trigger didn't declare."*

🔴 WHY THIS IS A SECURITY TEST, not a plumbing test. A tile's body is MODEL-AUTHORED, so the
action name that arrives at the endpoint is untrusted text. The property to prove is a
NEGATIVE — an action outside the frozen set is refused — and a negative is exactly the kind of
claim that passes vacuously: a fence that refused EVERYTHING would satisfy it while breaking
the feature. So every refusal test here is paired with a CONTROL leg proving the in-set action
is permitted and really re-fires, and the pair is asserted on the same tile.

The frozen set is derived from the tile's SAVED binding (`frozen_capabilities`), never from the
request — see the DEVIATION note in `dashboard/tile_actions.py` about "the trigger's" set: a
tile cannot bind a trigger until AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE step 8 lands (`TileRefresh.mode: "view"`
is deliberately absent), so the tile's binding is what is frozen today, enforced through the
SAME helper the trigger fence uses (`triggers.screen.unfenced_actions`).
