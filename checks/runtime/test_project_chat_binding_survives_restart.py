"""A project↔chat binding survives a gateway restart (issue 314).

`_ChatSession.project_id` was in-memory only. `save_session_to_history` rebuilds the whole metadata
line from the live session on every turn and never wrote it, and neither restore path read it —
measured mechanically: `grep project_id src/gideon/dashboard/chat_persistence.py` returned
NOTHING before this change.

The user-visible consequence is not "a field is missing". `/api/projects/<id>/linked` does not
consult storage; it scans live memory (`tasks/hierarchy_handlers.py`):

    for s in state._sessions.values():
        if getattr(s, "project_id", "") != pid:
            continue

So after a restart the project's **Chats** list came back EMPTY, and a restored project chat also
lost the context-directory access the binding grants.

`workspace_dir` — the same kind of fact, written on the very next line — WAS persisted, which is
what makes this an oversight rather than a decision.

These tests drive the real pair of paths rather than asserting on a dict, following
`test_acp_restart_binding.py`'s warning about this exact file: *"A test that only checked 'the key
is in the meta dict' would have passed on a half-fix: the reader lived in the OTHER restore path, so
the key was written and then never read back."* A gateway restart goes through the BULK path.

ARCC was queried for session-persistence guidance and returned nothing applicable (its session
material is Okta/IdP auth sessions; the one adjacent doc is SAX-04 Outcome 3 on input validation,
which is why the read is type-checked below). Standard practice applies.

    This file has now had it twice — `acp_provider` (the bulk path never read what the targeted one
    did) and `project_id` (nothing wrote what nothing read). Both are the same shape: the write list
    and the read list are maintained by hand, in different functions, hundreds of lines apart.

    So: every key `_restore_runtime_binding` reads out of meta must be a key the save path writes.
    A reader with no writer is a field that restores as empty forever — silently, because the
    session still loads and merely comes back scoped to nothing.

    The converse is deliberately NOT asserted: the save path legitimately writes keys this helper
    does not restore (`title`, `tags`, `folder_id` and others are handled by their own readers), so
    requiring symmetry in that direction would fail on correct code.
