"""LEARNING-VISIBILITY T1.3 (LV-1): the accept → surface → use loop closes.

One integration test over the REAL turn path, in the order a user experiences it:

    propose  →  accept  →  the next matching prompt surfaces the accepted skill
             →  its usage count increments

The seam driven here is ``ContextBuilder.build_message`` — the single function a
chat turn calls to assemble its prompt. It is chosen over calling
``surface_skills`` (or ``SkillsLoader.get_surfaced_skills``) directly because the
claim under test is about *the next matching prompt*, and only ``build_message``
contains the whole chain: ``skills.get_surfaced_skills(text)`` → ``load_skill``
per hit → ``allocate_skills(...)`` → ``SkillUsageStore().record_uses(loaded)``
(``context.py``, the ``if skill_requests:`` branch). Driving one link in
isolation would leave the other three unproven, and the use counter in
particular is written *only* on that path — a test that called
``surface_skills`` alone could pass with the counter entirely unwired.

The ContextBuilder is built ONCE, before the proposal is accepted, and both
turns run through that same long-lived instance — which is how the gateway holds
it. That also makes the "before" turn a real vacuity floor rather than a
different object: the same builder must go from *not* surfacing the skill to
surfacing it, with nothing between the two calls but the accept.

No model calls: the embedder is pinned absent, so surfacing runs its keyword
half (an isolated home has no embedding provider configured anyway, but pinning
it means this test can never reach out to one).
