"""The outcome record as a GENERAL ledger facility (PP-9).

`pending_outcome`/`outcome_resolved` used to be openable by one producer — a decision-making
workflow node — with `instance_path`/`node_id`/`epoch` welded into the record shape. This module
covers the generalized facility and the two non-decision producers wired onto it in the same
change, because a facility that is available and uncalled is exactly the declared-but-inert class
`PLATFORM-PRIMITIVES` §3 exists to kill.

What is asserted here, and why each clause is load-bearing:

* the CLOSED producer/source vocabulary — a typo becomes a loud `ValueError` at the open, not a
  producer nobody can query for later;
* IDEMPOTENCY via `pending_event_id` — `open_questions` subtracts answered questions by set
  membership, so a second resolver pass writes nothing. Driven by resolving the SAME question
  twice, not by reading the code;
* `measured` vs `inconclusive` drive DIFFERENT DECAY — the two resolutions map onto different
  `learning.decay` profiles, and at the same age the kernel keeps the measured evidence while
  pruning the inconclusive one. The direction is railed against the kernel's own table, so the
  two cannot drift into agreeing;
* the ledger-sourced measurement — ground truth read off the producer's own log, ordered by FILE
  POSITION rather than `seq` (a second writer for one run restarts its sequence at 1);
* both WIRED producers — a `publish:` artifact and a gate escalation actually open a question when
  driven, proven end-to-end rather than by grepping for the call.
