"""Crash-safe scheduling discipline (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §3.1 — S63).

§2's disposition is explicit that `schedule.py` is ABSORBED by rename, not
rewritten — so this session
layers the discipline onto the shipped mechanism rather than replacing it. Everything here is a pure
decision the service applies, which is what makes it assertable without a running gateway.

**The property measured first, because getting it wrong breaks migration day.** The shipped
`ScheduleService._jitter_offset` spreads jobs into stable id-derived slots. If
the trigger service used
a different algorithm, every migrated schedule would land in a different
sub-minute slot than the job
it came from — a silent re-phasing of every automation on the machine. The
parity test below asserts
bit-identical output against the real shipped function, for four ids including the empty one.

**The bug each rule prevents,** since a scheduling rule with no named failure is a rule nobody can
review:

* persist-before-execute → a crash between "decided to fire" and "fired" double-fires;
* recompute-from-completion → a run that overruns its interval re-fires instantly, forever;
* grid anchoring → that same recompute re-phases the schedule to whenever the overrun happened;
* boot stagger → a restart fires every automation at once;
* claim self-expiry → a killed process wedges a trigger permanently;
* revalidate-on-fire → a trigger disabled while the timer slept still fires
once, which reads as the
  off switch not working.
