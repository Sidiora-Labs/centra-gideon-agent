"""G40 — a blocking lifecycle hook must SAY whether it is armed.

Measured defect (AAP-3's sweep, 2026-08-17). Six lifecycle hooks were created through
``POST /api/triggers``, the ``PreToolUse`` one exiting 2 — the documented block signal. Driven
twice against the same hooks:

* **Unbound** (no agent profile referenced the hook ids): the hook fired **three times** and the
  write **still landed** — the target file contained the written content.
* **Bound** (the ids on the session agent's ``triggers``): the tool line read
  ``(hook blocked: aap3-pretool:hook denied)`` and the file was never created.

The mechanism is by design — ``chat_runner._fire`` is agent-scoped
(``ScriptHookStore.fire_for_ids``), while ``hooks.fire_tool_hooks`` →
``ScriptHookStore.fire`` is informational and its docstring says results "cannot block
execution". The defect was that a user who created a blocking hook got a silently inert safety
control: ``used_by: []`` was the only clue, and ``run_count: 3`` argued against it.

These tests pin the read model that closes it: ``GET /api/triggers`` reports ``enforcement`` per
lifecycle row, derived from the SAME agent-profile binding the firing path reads. Deliberately
driven through the handler with the REAL ``_used_by_index`` over a real ``config.json`` — patching
that index would exercise the serializer while leaving the config→binding→enforcement chain
(the thing that was wrong) unasserted.
