"""#630 — a list-shaped ``live_dirty`` was a fabricated False; now it is absent.

``get()`` computes ``live_dirty`` against the live source; ``list()`` rows come off
``_read_meta``, where the field is never persisted (``to_dict(persist=True)`` drops
it) — so the list value was ALWAYS the dataclass default, and the same artifact
reported False in the list and True in the detail. Every consumer already takes the
flag from a content-bearing response (one says so in a comment); these rails make
the wire honest so the next reader cannot mistake the default for an answer:
absent in the list, computed in the detail.
