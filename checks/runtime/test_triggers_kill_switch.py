"""The global kill switch, on the unified trigger path (decision 7 — S117).

🔴 THE DEFECT. `gideon incident on` did NOT stop a clock trigger. The CLI calls it
"Suspend/resume all unattended work", `guardrails/incident.py` is SEL-audited, and three other
subsystems honour it (hooks, subagent spawns, the legacy `event_triggers` fire path). The unified
engine — the SOLE path that fires clock triggers since S100 — never read the flag. Driven before a
line was written:

    incident active: True
    tick() -> fires: ['clock:nightly']    outcome=ran

So the one control an operator reaches for *during* an incident was the one thing that kept running
unattended work, while reporting itself active. Worse than a missing feature: a switch that lies.

🔴 THE SECOND DEFECT, found while wiring the first. `tools.run`'s `manual_gate_plan` PRINTED
"gates enforced: incident, screen, budget, claim, yield, capability" and enforced **none** of them —
it was a description with no enforcement anywhere. Measured with the switch thrown: `ok: True`, the
runner invoked. A plan that describes a control nobody applies is worse than no plan, because it
tells the user the boundary held.

Every test drives the REAL `incident` store under an isolated home.
