"""BA-2 live: the gate, the PRODUCTION transport, and a real browser.

``test_browse_cdp_preflight.py`` proves the gate against a recording fake. A fake can show
that ``navigate`` declines to call ``send``; it cannot show that Chrome's own
``Page.frameNavigated`` ever reaches ``handle_event``, because the fake is what synthesizes
that event in the first place. So the redirect clause — "client-side redirects re-evaluated
per ``Page.frameNavigated``" — was, until this file, asserted against a dict the test wrote
itself. Here a real page really redirects itself and the guard really tears it down.

Two things make the evidence stronger than the fake-transport version:

* **The server is the ordering oracle.** A denied navigation is asserted to leave NO request
  in a live HTTP server's hit ledger. "Zero ``Page.navigate`` messages" can be satisfied by a
  gate that decides late but happens to return early; "the socket was never dialled" cannot.
  Its vacuity partner is the allowed navigation immediately after, whose hit MUST appear.
* **Two hostnames, one loopback server.** ``--host-resolver-rules`` maps ``allowed.local``
  and ``denied.local`` to 127.0.0.1 and everything else to ``~NOTFOUND``, so the deny is a
  policy decision about a name rather than a network fact, a regression cannot reach any real
  site from this suite, and both names are equally reachable — which is what makes "the
  denied one produced no request" mean something.

HONEST LIMIT, asserted rather than glossed: for a *client-side* redirect the request has
ALREADY left the browser by the time ``Page.frameNavigated`` reports it. The guard cannot
un-send it; what it can do is ensure the agent never reads the denied document. So the
redirected-request hit IS expected in the ledger, and what this file asserts is the teardown —
the page ends on ``about:blank`` with the denied DOM gone. Claiming the request was prevented
would be a lie, and the plan's §6.3 already says so.
