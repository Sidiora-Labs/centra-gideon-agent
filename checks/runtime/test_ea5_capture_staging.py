"""EA-5's last two clauses: the `capture` staging source, and the retention CALL SITE.

Both halves of this file exist because of the same defect class. `capture_store.prune`
was shipped, config-round-tripped and unit-tested, and **nothing ever called it** — its
docstring said "called from the curator tick" while `git grep prune` found only its own
definition. A test that calls `prune()` directly would have passed for the whole of that
state, so the retention tests here drive the REAL consolidation tick and assert on files
disappearing, with an AST floor for the wire itself.

Every test drives a `tmp_path` home. `capture_dir()` and `staging._default_home()` both
resolve `config_dir()` per call (never cached at import) precisely so this monkeypatch
reaches them, and the staging store's process-global instance is reset around every test
— without that, a cached store from an earlier test would be the one written to, and the
row this suite asserts on would land somewhere it never looks.
