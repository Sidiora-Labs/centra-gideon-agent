"""The inbound door must not decide trust ahead of the gate it delegates to.

``channel_inbound._decide`` used to redeem a pairing code *before* calling
``channel_trust.guard_inbound``, and without reading the provider's ``dm_policy`` at all::

    if is_dm and not is_allowed_sender(provider, msg.sender):
        candidate = (msg.text or "").strip()
        if candidate.isdigit() and redeem_pairing_code(provider, msg.sender, candidate):
            return TrustVerdict(allowed=False, reason="paired", ...)

So an 8-digit-shaped DM paired its sender under ``dm_policy="owner_only"`` too — where the
owner's Allow is documented as the ONLY door — which made ``owner_only`` no stronger than
``pairing``. Measured on the pre-fix tree through the real door: the verdict came back
``reason="paired"``, the sender became allow-listed, the minted code was consumed, and the
stranger's NEXT DM started a live agent turn. A policy decision was pre-empted by a
credential-redemption side effect one layer above the policy.

It was latent (only ``reference_echo`` crosses the door today) and, after #950 moved
redemption into ``guard_inbound``, also redundant: the gate the door calls already redeems,
under ``pairing`` only. Both halves of that are pinned below — the refusal AND the fact
that deleting the pre-gate block did not break pairing, because a redeem path that nothing
else covered would have silently broken pairing on the one transport using the door.

**Reading the parametrisation.** The policy cases are derived from the shipped vocabulary
:data:`channel_trust.DM_POLICIES` rather than hand-listed, and
:func:`test_every_dm_policy_has_a_declared_pairing_outcome` fails if that vocabulary grows
a word this file has not decided about — a new DM policy must state whether a code opens it.
