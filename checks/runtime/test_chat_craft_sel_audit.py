"""CC-6 — the Security Event Log audit for CHAT-CRAFT's nine chat-surface mechanics.

The wrap-up atom's ``done_when`` reads: *"SEL shows one event per security-relevant
action across all seven mechanics (snip rides existing upload SEL)"*. It was written when
the surface had seven; the 2026-07-29 amendment added two more — **Branch** (``CC-7``) and
**chat plan mode** (``CC-8``) — and both carry server actions, so the audit here covers
**nine**. That sentence has three failure modes and this suite is written against all
three, because each one leaves the surface looking audited when it is not:

  1. **ZERO.** A rail that greps for a ``sel()`` call site passes on a call that never
     executes. So every assertion below drives the REAL handler and counts what landed in
     the log — a count of 0 reds.
  2. **MORE THAN ONE.** A duplicate is not cosmetic: two events for one action means two
     writers, and the audit page then over-reports every rewind a user performs. So the
     assertion is ``== 1``, not ``>= 1``.
  3. **A SECOND EVENT FOR SNIP.** The clause is explicit that snip *rides the existing
     upload SEL*. Minting a ``chat.snip`` beside ``upload.file`` would double-count one
     action and split the audit trail for attachments in two. So snip asserts exactly one
     ``upload.file`` **and** that nothing snip-shaped was invented.

**Three of the nine are client-only, and their honest count is zero.** Find, quote-reply
and the streaming reveal never leave the browser: find scans `turns[]` already in memory,
quote-reply writes into the composer, and the reveal only paces text the turn already
delivered. There is no endpoint to call and therefore no security-relevant action to
record — logging one would be noise, not coverage. That is asserted structurally (no
endpoint exists, and the modules make no request) rather than papered over with a count,
because "we checked and it is correctly silent" and "we forgot" look identical in a
report that only lists non-zero numbers.

The SEL these tests read is the per-test temp one — ``tests/conftest.py`` reroutes
``sel._default_dir`` and resets the singleton, so ``sel().recent()`` sees only events this
test produced. A leak into the real ``~/.gideon`` would fail conftest's own rail.
