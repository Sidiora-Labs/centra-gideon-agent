"""CE2-10 — the resumed session's DERIVED account of what already happened.

The defect under test is behavioural, not cosmetic: a resumed turn re-runs a step the record
already shows finished. So the assertions here are about what a resumed turn is TOLD and what it
is refused, never about "the renderer produced a string".

Three of these tests are the atom's load-bearing negatives and are written so that the obvious
wrong implementation goes red:

* ``test_a_failed_step_is_never_reported_as_done`` — fold ``step_failed`` into ``done`` and it reds.
* ``test_nothing_reaches_the_account_that_is_not_in_a_record`` — compose the account from prose and
  it reds.
* ``test_a_record_contradicting_the_tree_refuses_the_resume`` — let an inconsistent tree proceed and
  it reds.
* ``test_the_account_survives_a_compaction_verbatim`` — drop the block from the carried set and it
  reds.

The ledger halves drive the REAL ``workflows.journal.Journal`` emitters rather than hand-written
dicts, because the reader is only worth anything if it reads what the writer writes — a reader of a
key nothing emits is the inert-control shape, and hand-rolled fixtures cannot tell the two apart.
