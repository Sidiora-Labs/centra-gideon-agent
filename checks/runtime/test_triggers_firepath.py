"""The fire path — §3's ordered gate composition (S86).

§3 states the order and says "order matters". **Measured before writing: nothing composed
it.** A grep
for live callers of `claim_fire`, `boot_recovery`, `spool_fire`, `drain_spool`,
`freeze_capabilities`,
`evaluate_quiet`, `evaluate_duty`, `needs_attention`, `resolve_missed`, `changed_files` and
`build_delivery` outside their own modules returned NONE for every one. There is no
`triggers/service.py`, and sessions S62-S85 each recorded "NOT DONE (by scope): the service" — eight
such notes in the plan's execution log.

The load-bearing tests are the three ordering ones, because ordering is the whole contract:
`test_the_screen_refuses_before_a_quiet_window_can`,
`test_the_budget_refuses_before_a_claim_is_taken`,
and `test_the_capability_filter_runs_before_any_def_resolves`.
