"""Hardening: the timeout pair, the active-edge pair, and journal replay (Slice 11b).

Four acceptance criteria the plan names explicitly, plus the replay harness. Each exists because the
mechanism it covers only ever executes under failure, which is exactly when nobody is watching:

**The timeout pair** (WF2-R5). Two knobs, and the whole point is that they mean different things: a
long-but-PROGRESSING node survives, a SILENT one dies. Collapsing them is not a subtle degradation —
it kills nodes that are visibly working, and the plan's cautionary case is an engine that shipped a
timeout nobody noticed was a no-op.

**The active-edge pair** (WF2-R18). A join must wait on the legs that will actually run and no
others. Both directions are bugs: waiting on an untaken branch deadlocks forever, and firing on
"any completed predecessor" fires early on a fan-out whose other legs are still waiting.

**Journal replay** (WF2-R11). The journal is both the resume cache and the Run Ledger, so "can a
run's trajectory be reconstructed from ledger events alone?" is a correctness property, not a
reporting nicety. The metrics here — duplicate rate, order violations, fan-out ratio — are the ones
that go wrong silently.
