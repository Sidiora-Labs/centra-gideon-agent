"""cross_model judge isolation, ENFORCED at the gate (WF2LOO-11).

`isolation: cross_model` promises a judge on a different model FAMILY than the worker — a
same-family "independent" judge shares the blind spots it exists to catch. `judge_actors`
implemented the family check (`plan_judge_session` / `validate_judge_model`) but had no caller, so a
template asking for cross-model independence silently got fresh-session isolation only (S146). This
pins the wiring that closed that gap:

* a `cross_model` gate whose judge resolves to a DIFFERENT family runs it — and provably passes the
  validated model down to the completion call, so the judge runs on the model it was checked
  against, not a use-case guess;
* a `cross_model` gate that can only obtain a SAME-family (or undeterminable) judge FAILS CLOSED —
  it never silently downgrades to fresh, which is the exact defect this atom fixes.

The model resolution is injected (`judge_model_resolver`), so these need no live provider.
