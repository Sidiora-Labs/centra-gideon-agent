"""ProviderSettings config path — must agree with the Apps config UI's path.

Regression for bug #31: the provider-build read path (ProviderSettings.config_path)
resolved to ``app_dir/config.json`` while the Apps config UI (apps.app_config) wrote
to ``app_dir/data/config.json``. So a provider key set in the UI never reached the
provider when it was built at boot (brave/tavily/etc. showed unavailable despite a
configured key). The two MUST resolve to the same file, inside ``data/`` (A2-preserved).
