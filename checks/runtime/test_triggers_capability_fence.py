"""Decision 7's frozen-capability fence, actually enforced (§1.4 / R3 — S116).

🔴 THE DEFECT. `FireContext.requested` defaulted to `{}` and **nothing in production
ever populated it**. The only real construction (`service.tick`) omitted the field, so
`evaluate`'s `if ctx.requested:` was always false and the frozen-capability fence —
decision 7's whole enforcement point — had never run on a single real fire. It passed
its own unit tests the whole time, because those supply `requested` by hand.

Exactly the shape of S97's `existing_claim` finding, in the gate directly below it: a
control that is present, reviewed, and enforcing nothing because its input has no writer.

🔴 AND WIRING IT ALONE WOULD HAVE REFUSED EVERY AUTOMATION IN EXISTENCE. Measured before
choosing: no writer sets `capabilities` — not `tools.create`, not the app-cron
reconciler, not the digest reconciler, not the CLI, not the API — and every one of them
creates a WRITE-CAPABLE action (`invoke-agent`, `run-prompt`, `notification-digest`). The
fence denies on an empty block, so enforcement without decision 7's read-only default
plus a save-time freeze would have been a 100% outage of user automations dressed as a
security fix.
