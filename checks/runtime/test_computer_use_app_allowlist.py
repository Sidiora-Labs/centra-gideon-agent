"""`DCU-2` — the operator's target-app allowlist, stored in the keystone enable document.

The allowlist answers "the agent may drive WHAT", where `DCU-1`'s keystone answers "may the
agent drive anything at all". It lives in the same out-of-band document for the same reason:
it is what stands between "computer use is on" and "the agent may drive your password
manager", so a PATCH-editable home for it would hand an agent with config-write access a
route to widen its own reach.

What this file pins, and why each one needs pinning:

1. **Fail closed on emptiness.** Absent or `[]` → nothing may be driven. Asserted as a
   *meaning* (membership refuses every name) rather than as `== ()`, because the tuple being
   empty is not the property that matters — the property is that a consumer asking "is this
   app allowed?" gets no for everything.
2. **Refused, not normalised.** A malformed entry must red the document rather than become a
   broader value. Every case asserts the allowlist is *also* empty, since the failure worth
   catching is the one where `" Mail "` quietly becomes `Mail`.
3. **Exact comparison.** Includes NEARBY names that must NOT be members. A rail that only
   proves `"TextEdit" in allowed_apps()` cannot detect a match rule that is too generous,
   which is the only direction that costs anything here.
4. **`DCU-1`'s strict parse survives the extension** — an unknown key is still refused, and a
   wrong `SCHEMA_VERSION` is still refused rather than best-effort parsed.
5. **One reader.** An AST rail proves `EnableState.apps` is touched only inside
   `allowed_apps()`. `require_enabled`'s docstring records why: while `enabled` briefly had
   two readers, forcing one to return True left every refusal test green.
6. **`ENABLE_DOCUMENT` is a document that works.** It is quoted verbatim in the refusal's FIX
   line, so if it armed a capability that could drive nothing, an operator would follow the
   instructions exactly and hit a second refusal whose own FIX named nothing further to do.
