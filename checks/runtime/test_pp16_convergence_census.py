"""Which of `PP-16`'s six "one X" clauses have CONVERGED, measured rather than assumed.

The atom's `done_when` names six unifications: *"One status vocabulary, one adoption/reaping path,
one attention path, one ledger, one projection to tasks, one cockpit contract."* Two of those six
are **already satisfied** — `PP-5` made the loop a `gideon.ledger` writer, and
`workflows/attention.py` was built on the loop watchdog's own inbox seam. A clause that has already
converged is as load-bearing to record as one that has not: a later slice that "unifies the ledger"
would be writing code for a problem that no longer exists, and a slice that re-forks either seam
would silently undo a landed atom.

So this rail is a census with two directions, in the idiom `test_pp16_loop_field_map.py`
established for the field map:

* **The converged clauses are RATCHETS.** Ledger and attention are asserted to still funnel through
  one seam each. If a future change gives loops their own ledger writer or their own
  `state.notify` + `store.add` pair again, this reds — which is the only thing standing between
  "`PP-5` landed" and "`PP-5` landed and then rotted".
* **The unconverged clauses are PINNED COUNTS that must SHRINK.** Reaping, the task projection, the
  cockpit contract and the pluggable supervisor each still have exactly two implementations (or, for
  the supervisor, five registered strategies). Each count is pinned with the file:line of both
  sides, so the slice that unifies one of them reds HERE and updates the census as part of landing —
  rather than leaving a stale "still open" list in a plan nobody re-measures.

**Why source text and not imports.** These are structural facts about which modules exist and which
seams they call, and importing `loop.watchdog` or the dashboard handlers drags in a gateway's worth
of module-level state. Reading the shipped source is the cheaper probe for a structural claim, and
it cannot be fooled by a test-time monkeypatch.

Vacuity floors throughout: every scan asserts its own target file was found and non-empty before
concluding anything from a match count, and the seam probes are proved to REJECT a symbol that does
not exist (a substring scan that always returns "absent" would pass every convergence assertion by
being uniformly blind).
