"""Which of `PP-16`'s six "one X" clauses have CONVERGED, measured rather than assumed.

The atom's `done_when` names six unifications: *"One status vocabulary, one adoption/reaping path,
one attention path, one ledger, one projection to tasks, one cockpit contract."* Three of those six
are **satisfied** — `PP-5` made the loop a `gideon.assurance.ledger` writer, `automation/workflows/attention.py`
was built on the loop watchdog's own inbox seam, and the adoption/reaping slice converged both
nouns' boot sweeps onto `concurrency.boot_sweep`. A clause that has already converged is as
load-bearing to record as one that has not: a later slice that "unifies the ledger" would be
writing code for a problem that no longer exists, and a slice that re-forks either seam would
silently undo a landed atom.

So this rail is a census with two directions, in the idiom `test_pp16_loop_field_map.py`
established for the field map:

* **The converged clauses are RATCHETS.** Ledger, attention and boot adoption are asserted to still
  funnel through one seam each. If a future change gives loops their own ledger writer, their own
  `state.notify` + `store.add` pair, or their own private boot sweep again, this reds — which is the
  only thing standing between "`PP-5` landed" and "`PP-5` landed and then rotted". `PP-16` seam 3
  moved the PLUGGABLE SUPERVISOR into this group too: the convergence decision is declared data plus
  one evaluator, and the ratchet is keyed on the retired MEMBERS rather than on a class name (see
  below for why that distinction is load-bearing).
* **The unconverged clauses are PINNED COUNTS that must SHRINK.** The task projection and the
  cockpit contract each still have exactly two implementations. Each count is pinned with the
  file:line of both sides, so the slice that unifies one of them reds HERE and updates the census as
  part of landing — rather than leaving a stale "still open" list in a plan nobody re-measures.

**Why source text and not imports.** These are structural facts about which modules exist and which
seams they call, and importing `loop.watchdog` or the dashboard handlers drags in a gateway's worth
of module-level state. Reading the shipped source is the cheaper probe for a structural claim, and
it cannot be fooled by a test-time monkeypatch.

Vacuity floors throughout: every scan asserts its own target file was found and non-empty before
concluding anything from a match count, and the seam probes are proved to REJECT a symbol that does
not exist (a substring scan that always returns "absent" would pass every convergence assertion by
being uniformly blind).
