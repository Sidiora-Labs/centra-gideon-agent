"""The desktop shell must DECLARE its install kind (`DC-1` T1.3, DISTRIBUTION C1) — #2673.

`self_update.detect_install_kind()` resolves ``GIDEON_INSTALL_KIND`` first, then probes
``GIDEON_PROJECT_DIR`` for a ``.git``, then falls back to ``"pip"``. The ``"desktop"``
member is therefore *produced* by exactly one thing in this repository — the Electron shell's
spawn env — and consumed by three: the Updates panel, ``POST /api/update``, and
``gideon update``.

Nothing produced it. `DC-6` shipped the Linux AppImage/.deb to every GitHub Release while
`DC-1`'s install-kind clause was still open, and `apps/desktop/main.js` set ``PROJECT_DIR`` but not
``INSTALL_KIND`` — so inside the bundle the project dir is ``…/resources`` (no ``.git``) and the
gateway classified itself as a **pip install**. The Updates panel then offered an in-app apply
that runs ``<installer> install -U gideon==<tag>`` against ``sys.executable``, which in a
packaged app is the frozen PyInstaller backend: there is no interpreter there to upgrade.

Every existing test of the desktop kind sets the env var ITSELF
(``checks/runtime/test_self_update.py::test_desktop_env_wins``,
``test_update_apply_kind.py::test_desktop_returns_instructions``,
``test_cli_update_kinds.py::test_desktop_kind_delegates_to_the_app_and_exits_zero``) — a suite
that stayed green over a value no shipped code emitted. These are the rails that read the
producing side.

Parsed from source rather than executed, the ``test_desktop_seam.py`` precedent: node is not a
test dependency, and `apps/desktop/test/gatewayEnv.test.js` already executes the builder.
