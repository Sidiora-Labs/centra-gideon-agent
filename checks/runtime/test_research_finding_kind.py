"""WF2KNO-12 — the ``research-finding`` kind: indexed, listed by request only, delivered.

Every claim is asserted as an outcome a caller could observe:

* "listed by request only" runs the REAL ``GET /api/knowledge/items`` handler
  (``list_items``), never a helper that mirrors its where-clause. A test that rebuilt the
  filter would keep passing while the endpoint listed findings;
* "declared in one place" is asserted by MOVING the declaration —
  ``DEFAULT_LIST_EXCLUDED_KINDS`` is emptied and the finding must reappear. That is the only
  assertion that can tell a handler reading the set from a handler with the kind hardcoded,
  since both behave identically when the set happens to hold that one kind;
* "still findable" searches (``search_items_fts`` plus the handler's own ``?q=`` branch)
  rather than asserting an ``items`` row. The store's FTS5 is external-content with no
  triggers, so a row present in ``items`` and absent from ``items_fts`` is invisible to every
  search — asserting the row would pass with search fully broken;
* "delivered" drives ``inbox.emit_attention_item`` — the existing path that persists the
  durable row and notifies as ONE event — and asserts both halves plus the digest heading.
  No sender is added anywhere; this atom's contribution to delivery is the registry row that
  keeps the finding out of the ``system/generic`` fallback.

Isolation: a ``tmp_path`` home, a ``tmp_path`` sqlite file and a ``tmp_path`` inbox file, so
nothing reaches the real home.
