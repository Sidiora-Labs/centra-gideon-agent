"""Skill bodies allocate on the one prompt budget (CONTEXT-ECONOMY CE2-9).

The clause this file exists for, verbatim: *"A test drives a deliberately oversized skill
against a small budget and asserts the conversation survives with the skill reduced — not
that the allocator was called."* So the anchor test below drives the REAL
``PromptAssembler.build_message`` path with a 42,000-token skill and asserts properties of
the assembled prompt: the user's request is in it, the skill's steps are not, the skill's
declared summary is, and the total is small. Nothing here asserts that ``allocate`` was
invoked — a mechanism can be invoked and ignored.
