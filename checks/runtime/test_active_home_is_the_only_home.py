"""Every Gideon-home path in `src/` follows the ACTIVE home (issue 287).

`GIDEON_HOME` is the isolation boundary the whole project rests on: `make serve`
defaults it to `./.dev-home`, every destructive test is required to point it at `tmp_path`,
and `--seed` refuses to run against the real home. A site that spells
`Path.home() / ".gideon"` outright opts out of all of that.

**This has now been found and fixed FOUR times, in four different modules, and each fix left
a comment instead of a check.** The comments are still in the tree:

* `agent.py:_bundled_hooks` — the bundled `postToolUse` hook wrote to a literal
  `~/.gideon/audit.log`, so *"every isolated-home session appends to the operator's
  REAL home instead of its own — a home-isolation break in a security control"* (`G31`).
* `dashboard/handlers/files.py` — the Uploads + Gideon browse roots, where a dev
  gateway would *"browse AND edit the developer's REAL home via the write allowlist"* (#294).
* `dashboard/handlers/mcp.py:_canonical_mcp_json` — *"the old `Path.home()` hardcode ignored
  it"*.
* `subagent_persistence.py` — a module-level `config_dir()` constant, converted to a call.

And the fourth comment says out loud what kept happening:

    NO `_canonical_mcp_json()` constant here: it was `Path.home() / ".gideon" /
    "mcp.json"`, computed at import time, so it ignored GIDEON_HOME exactly as the
    comment on `_canonical_mcp_json()` (above) says the old hardcode did — **the same bug,
    fixed in one function and left in three siblings.**

Measured on `origin/main` when this rail was written: five live sites still ignored the env
var — two in `handlers/mcp.py` (including `_remove_from_agent_file`, which DELETES an entry
from the file it resolves), two in `mcp_core.py` (one of them the only *write*, with an
unconditional `mkdir`), and one in `mcp_discovery.py`. So a comment naming the pattern, four
times over, did not stop the fifth. A ratchet does.

ARCC was queried first (file access + infrastructure are trigger domains). The applicable
guidance is the *isolate data from other processes* recommendation — write "to disk under a
more restrictive and user/processes specific folder location" — plus SAX-06 Outcome 3's
append-only, least-privilege treatment of audit logs. The CloudTrail/S3/KMS material in both
documents is cloud infrastructure and does not apply to a local file; noted, not stretched.
