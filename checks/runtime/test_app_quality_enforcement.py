"""A dishonest quality declaration must turn CI red (APE-4).

This atom's subject IS declared-vs-actual honesty, which makes it self-referential: if
the enforcement were unrailed, APE-4 would have shipped the very defect it exists to
catch — a control that claims something and is never checked. So the load-bearing
assertion here is not that the schema parses or that a badge renders. It is that **a
claim which is false fails the build**, proven by planting a lie on each axis and
observing the failure.

Every lie is paired with a **vacuity floor**: the same bundle declaring the same axis
HONESTLY must come back clean. Without that pair, "the verifier returned violations"
could mean the verifier is broken and fails everything — the same defect wearing a
different hat, and a much harder one to notice.

The second honesty axis, easy to miss: an app that declares NOTHING. Absent must not
read as passing, and must not be silently rewritten to ``false``. An unbadged app and a
failing app are different states; a checker that demanded evidence for an undeclared
axis would punish silence harder than an honest miss.

Everything runs under ``tmp_path``. The one test that really spawns pytest builds its
bundle there too, so no run touches a real app tree or the real home.
