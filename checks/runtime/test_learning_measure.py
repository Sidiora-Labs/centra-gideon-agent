"""S71 — per-arm precision, threshold tuning from data, Beta-Binomial trust (LEARN-R4 / §2.5).

§7 criterion 7 is the bar, and it has three clauses: per-arm surfaced-vs-used precision is
REPORTABLE per entity kind, threshold profiles are TUNABLE FROM DATA, and a muted chip visibly
LOWERS an entity's trust posterior. Each has a test named for it below.

**Measured before writing any of it.** `learning/surfacing.py` already carried `THRESHOLD_PROFILES`
(the deliberate 0.55/0.62 split) and `learning/usage.py` already persisted
`surfaced`/`used`/`successes`/`failures`. What was missing was the middle: `Candidate` had no
`arm`, so nothing could attribute a surfacing to the path that produced it. And
`memory_push.ARM_CONFIDENCE` already existed — writing a second table diverged on the first
comparison, which is why `test_the_shipped_arm_table_is_imported_not_restated` exists.
