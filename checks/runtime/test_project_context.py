"""Tests for the project living context — overview, ledgers, injected block (S46).

These write to a real (monkeypatched) config dir rather than mocking the store, because the two
properties under test are about FILES: the overview is revised in place while the ledgers are
append-only, and a mocked store would let both pass while neither held on disk.

The load-bearing distinction: overview is current state, the decisions ledger is history. Collapsing
them means either losing the history or making the current state something a reader
reconstructs from
a log — and a reader who has to reconstruct it will not.
