"""EI-6 SC5, the SPAWN half — a durable worker is actually OPENED, survives the gateway,
and the shipped recovery machinery reattaches to it.

`test_ei6_runner_lifecycle.py` proved the READER: a recovery sweep that recognises a live
durable session and suspends instead of tombstoning. What it could not prove — because
nothing produced one — is that core ever PLACES work in such a session. This suite closes
that gap at the seam that now exists: `tmux_substrate.new_session` (the one writer of
durable sessions) and `provisioning.run_step`'s durable branch (the run-worker launch that
uses it, gated on `durable_sessions_enabled()` with the bare subprocess as the
unconditional fallback).

**The same honesty statement as the sibling suite.** ``tmux`` is not installed on the
machine this was written on, so the daemon is substituted by a shim executable literally
named ``tmux`` on ``PATH`` — but the substitution is one level below the code under test
and it defers to the OS for the one question that matters:

* ``new-session`` REALLY spawns the given command, detached (``start_new_session``), with
  the given cwd — and then the shim process exits, so the worker's survival is genuine
  reparenting, not a fixture flag;
* ``has-session``/``list-panes`` answer via ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` — the kernel's liveness;
* ``kill-session`` really kills the process group.

The production argv composition, the subprocess spawns, the exit-code contracts, the
rc/out file plumbing and the whole sweep chain run verbatim. The one class that needs the
real daemon (`TestSC5RealTmux`) is skipif-gated on the binary and runs the same clauses
against a real tmux server wherever one exists.

The dead legs rely on the shim's children being reparented to init/launchd when the shim
exits — the reaper that keeps ``kill(pid, 0)`` honest (no zombie can linger under a parent
that is already gone). The sibling suite had to ``wait()`` by hand precisely because ITS
workers stayed children of the test process; these do not.
