"""`when:` → trigger kind routing (§4 — S92).

§4's NL contract is one line with two destinations: "`when: "every weekday at 9"` routes through
`nl_to_cron`; `when: "when a file in ~/notes changes"` → file kind." Nothing routed between them.

**🔴 THE FAILURE THESE TESTS PIN.** `nl_to_cron` is cron-shaped by construction. Measured before
writing the module:

    parse_cron_response("when a file in ~/notes changes")
      -> ("", "Could not parse a 5-field cron expression from: 'when a file in ~/note…'")

The error is the GOOD case. The bad case is a model asked for a cron expression while handed a
file-watch request answering `* * * * *` — which VALIDATES (asserted below), schedules, and turns
"when a file changes" into a per-minute LLM turn. So routing must happen before the cron converter
is consulted, and an unroutable request must refuse rather than default to a schedule.

Two more defects the probe caught before any test existed, both pinned here: a URL routing to
`file` (producing the impossible glob `//example.com/page/**`), and a change verb that reached the
dedup hint but not the routing check.
