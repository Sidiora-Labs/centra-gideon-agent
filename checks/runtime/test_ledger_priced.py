"""An absent cost is not a zero cost, on the ledger primitive itself (#2566).

`ledger.reader.run_totals` seeded its accumulators at zero and summed
``rec.get("cost_usd", 0.0) or 0.0``. The primitive has TWO producers and only one books a cost:

* `workflows/journal.py::Journal.step_completed` writes `cost_usd` on every row — a ``0.0`` there is
  a real observation (a free local model).
* `loop/journal.py::LoopJournal.cycle` writes no `cost_usd` at all. Loop money lives in
  `usage/turns.jsonl` and `loop/manager.py::loop_spend` reads it there — a deliberate deviation
  recorded in that function's own docstring, because booking it here too would be one dollar in two
  stores.

So every loop that has ever run reported ``cost_usd: 0.0``, byte-identical to a genuinely-free run.
Measured on `origin/main` before this change, over two ledgers written by their REAL producers:

    LOOP (2 cycles, real spend in usage/turns.jsonl):
        {"cost_usd": 0.0, "steps_cached": 0, "steps_completed": 2, "steps_failed": 0, "tokens": 0}
    FREE RUN (2 steps, genuinely $0 local model):
        {"cost_usd": 0.0, "steps_cached": 0, "steps_completed": 2, "steps_failed": 0, "tokens": 0}
    keys that differ: NONE

The fix adds `priced` beside the existing keys rather than turning `cost_usd` into
``float | None``: the sum is legitimately a float and every caller's arithmetic depends on it, so
the honesty rides beside the number. The word is `usage_ledger`'s and `loop_spend`'s, unchanged —
``priced=False`` means the figure is a FLOOR and must render as unknown, never ``$0.00``. One word
for one fact across both money surfaces; a synonym would be the very defect shape this fix removes.

Both directions are asserted everywhere, because a suite that only covered the loop case would pass
with `priced` hard-coded to ``False`` and would then misreport every free local run as unmeasured.
