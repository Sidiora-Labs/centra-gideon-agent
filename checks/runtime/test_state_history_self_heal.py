"""Time-travel heals a partially destroyed repo instead of failing forever.

The failure this pins was observed live: a /tmp cleaner pruned ``objects/`` and
``refs/`` out of a history repo by file age while ``HEAD`` survived. The old
``ensure_repo`` judged existence by ``HEAD`` alone, so the husk passed the
check and then EVERY git command failed "not a git repository" — permanently,
on the five-minute scheduler cadence (565 consecutive failures logged), while
the panel's ``has_head`` probe failed the opposite way and showed an innocently
empty history. Two surfaces, two different wrong answers, no recovery.

The heal's contract, each half pinned here:

* an unusable repo is detected by asking GIT (not by an anatomy checklist);
* the husk is RETIRED ASIDE (renamed, never deleted — this module does not
  destroy data) into a name outside the ``.git`` namespace;
* a fresh history starts in the same call, so the next scheduled commit
  succeeds and recording resumes without operator action;
* a healthy repo is left exactly alone (the heal must not be a reset button).
