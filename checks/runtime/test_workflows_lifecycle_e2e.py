"""The full lifecycle, end to end, and the adversarial cases (Slice 11a).

Every other workflow test file exercises one seam. This one drives the whole thing the way a user
does — create, run, edit mid-flight, rewind, run-from, fork, complete — because the interesting
failures of this engine are not in any single mechanism, they are in the handoffs BETWEEN them: a
rewind that leaves a stale cache key, a fork that shares an epoch, a resume that re-answers a gate.

The adversarial half deliberately does the things a careful user would not:

* mutate a run twice concurrently, so the TOCTOU re-verify has to fire;
* kill a controller mid-node and rebuild it, which is what a gateway restart actually is;
* answer the same gate twice, which is what a double-clicked Approve button actually is;
* nest to the depth cap and past it.

These are the cases where "it works on my machine" and "it works after a restart" diverge, and none
of them is reachable by a test that only calls one function.
