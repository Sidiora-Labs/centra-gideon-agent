"""G39 rails — the cwd that reaches a spawned ACP CLI must stay inside the CONFIGURED workspace.

These assert the SPAWN KWARGS: the ``cwd=`` value handed to the sandbox handle's ``exec``,
which is literally what ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` receives. That seam is the point,
not a resolver's return value — the defect these rails exist for was a per-session working
directory that the resolvers got right and the spawn path then ignored, so a unit test over a
helper passed while a profile-bound session ran the CLI in the operator's REAL home
(``~/.gideon/workspace``), defeating GIDEON_HOME, dev homes and test fixtures.

Every test pins BOTH ``GIDEON_HOME`` and ``GIDEON_WORKSPACE`` under ``tmp_path``;
the containment rail then reds on any spawn cwd outside that workspace root.
