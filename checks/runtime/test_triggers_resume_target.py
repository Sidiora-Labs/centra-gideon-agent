"""A scheduled trigger that RESUMES a parked run instead of starting a new one.

🔴 **What was measured before this was written.** `wakeup.resume_for`, `WakeKind.RESUME`,
`Disposition.REQUEUED`, `dispatch.droppable` and `wakeup.retry_queue` were all shipped, documented
and unit tested — and `resume_for` had **zero production callers**. Only `wakeup_for` was reachable,
from `dispatch_fires`, and it always built a `wake`. So §3's own documented fire-path step (`resolve
def / **resume target**`, in `firepath`'s header) had no producer, and `WF2LOO-9`'s
`goal-pursuit-monitor` clause was blocked on a resume target that could not be declared.

**And the consumer half was worse than absent.** `executor.drain` never dispatches on
`Wakeup.kind` — `grep -n kind executor.py` returns exactly one hit, inside a prose docstring. So a
resume queued onto a session inbox is drained and handed to the trigger's ordinary action runner: a
resume that reports success while doing entirely different work, unattended. That is why a resume
target never reaches `deliver()` at all (`Disposition.RESUME_TARGET`) and the loop applies it to the
run directly.

**The bar this file holds itself to.** "A scheduled fire that reaches a mailbox nobody opens is
silently discarded", and every run in this subsystem's history had been started by hand. So the
central test does not assert that a fire was enqueued, or that `resume_run` was called. It builds a
REAL run, drives it to a REAL gate, fires a REAL trigger through `_execute_delivery`, and then reads
**the downstream node's output out of the run's own store** — a value that cannot exist unless the
run actually carried on past the gate.
