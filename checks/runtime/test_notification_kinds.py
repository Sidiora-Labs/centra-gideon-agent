"""The notification kind registry (INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION T1.1).

The load-bearing tests here are the two that catch a *silent* regression:

* ``test_every_default_mode_is_immediate`` — this plan replaces the delivery path with no
  gate, so a `badge` default would stop delivering a kind as a side effect of a refactor.
  The user would read that as "notifications broke."
* ``test_every_emitted_kind_string_resolves`` — walks the AST of `src/` for real
  `.notify()` call sites and asserts each flat kind string maps to a registration. A new
  emitter with an unregistered kind is caught here rather than by a warning in a log
  nobody reads.
