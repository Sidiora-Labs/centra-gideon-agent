"""The denylist at the THIRD dispatch seam — `gateway._fire_store_trigger` (AG-12).

🔴 THE DEFECT, measured before a line was written. AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.2 declares the
path/action denylist is enforced at the three dispatch seams every action-provider execution
passes through, "so an app-contributed provider inherits the denylist without knowing it exists",
and names them: `hooks.py`, `gateway.py:701`, `event_triggers.py`. Counting `enforce_action` per
seam file gave 1 / 0 / 1 — the gateway seam had the kill switch (2 `incident_active` calls) and,
since AG-7, the rung ladder, but no denylist at all.

The third name, `gateway.py:701`, is `_run_action_job`, which retired with `ScheduleService`
(S112); the note left at its old site says the substrate "GENERALIZED both: action dispatch is
`_fire_store_trigger`". The gate was lost in that retirement and never re-established on the
successor — retiring a legacy path is never a pure deletion. And the successor is the busiest
unattended path in the product: every clock, file, webhook and chained trigger dispatches through
it, so before this every one of them reached its provider with no denylist check, app-contributed
providers included.

Driven through the real `_fire_store_trigger` rather than against `check_action`, because the
defect was never in the denylist — it was in the seam that failed to call it. A unit test on
`enforce_action` passed throughout.
