"""ACP-AGENT-PARITY §2.5 (atom ``AAP-8``) — tool-card fidelity and risk plumbing.

Three gaps, and the reason each one needed a different shape of fix:

* **gap 7, structured input.** ``translate.py`` receives a real ``rawInput`` object and
  ``json.dumps``-ed it away, so ``chat_runner._redact_tool_input_obj`` was handed a
  ``str``, returned ``None`` by contract, and every ACP tool card fell back to the flat
  string preview no matter how well the CLI described its call. Fixed by carrying the
  object BESIDE the string (``tool_input_obj``) rather than replacing it — the string is
  what the card prints, and flattening the object into that field would have changed
  every existing preview to buy the fields.
* **gap 7, diff chips.** The native chip is inferred: a write-tool NAME set, a workspace
  path resolution, a disk read. None of that transfers to a CLI whose edit tool is named
  and shaped however its vendor chose. An ACP ``diff`` content block states path, old
  text and new text outright, so the chip is built from the declaration alone.
* **gap 8, declared risk.** Measured, and it needed NO plumbing: for every dict-defined
  core tool the "declaration" IS the name inference (``agents/native/tools.py`` uses
  ``infer_risk_from_name`` when the dict carries no explicit ``risk_level``, and none
  does), so threading a declared level through the MCP listing would compute the same
  answer twice. The rail below pins that equivalence instead, so the day a core tool
  declares an explicit level, the divergence fails here rather than silently mislabeling
  an approval card.

The three tool-name renderings exercised here are the ones MEASURED live on 2026-08-24
during ``AAP-4``'s reachability drive — codex renders ``mcp.gideon-core.notify``,
claude-code ``mcp__gideon-core__notify`` and kiro-cli ``@gideon-core/notify``
for the same server. A risk resolver that only handles one dialect mislabels two thirds
of the fleet, so every risk assertion runs over all three.
