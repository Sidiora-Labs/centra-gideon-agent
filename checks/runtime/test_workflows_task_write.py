"""The projected Task WRITE, and the actor asymmetry it depends on (TASKS-SOPS §1 — S61g).

S61f wired the projection call site but wrote nothing — it emitted the event and recorded
the binding.
This session makes the Task real, which is the first point in the whole program where running a
workflow puts a row on the user's board.

The write is the ENGINE actor in §1's three-actor matrix, and the asymmetry is the entire
design: the
engine sets a managed task's status directly, and `materialize.reject_write` refuses that same write
from anyone else, naming the alternative (`workflow_skip`/`workflow_rewind`). Two writers on one
status field produce a board that disagrees with the run it shows — and the user believes
the board.

Driven through REAL runs, because the shape being tested is "does the row appear when a workflow
runs". A unit test on the writer would not have caught the async mismatch below.

Measured while wiring: the settle path (`_apply`) is SYNC but runs inside the async tick, while the
task provider's `create_task` is async. The event now fires from the write's COMPLETION so `task_id`
is the real id — an event with an empty id would tell a board to render a row it cannot open.
