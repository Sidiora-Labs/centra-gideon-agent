"""The path-matcher rule, encoded as a table (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5 / SH5.2).

**What reds this file.** An implementation that runs the PATTERN through ``normpath``.
``normpath`` treats ``*``/``**`` as ordinary path segments and collapses an adjacent ``..``
against them, so ``/a/**/../b`` silently becomes ``/a/b`` — the ``**`` is dropped and the
rule widens (an allow) or shrinks (a deny). Every row below states the documented outcome,
and the three rows the plan named verbatim are marked. ``test_normpath_on_pattern_would_red``
is the mutation proof: it re-runs the table against a normpath-ing implementation and
asserts that it fails, so this file cannot pass for the wrong implementation.
