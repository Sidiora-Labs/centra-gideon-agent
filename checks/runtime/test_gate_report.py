"""Aggregate-gate report tests (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §6 — PHF-11).

``scripts/gate_report.py`` runs the six §3/§6 drift/inert gates (config-baseline,
inert-surface, docs-lint, and PHF-14's three structural ratchets) and reports EVERY failure in
one run — the "aggregate, don't short-circuit" ergonomic. These tests prove the contract:

  * three INDEPENDENT failures all surface in a single ``run_all_gates()`` call — none masked;
  * a gate that RAISES is captured as a failure and does NOT stop the others;
  * an all-pass run exits 0 and the table shows every gate PASS;
  * the one rendered table carries every failure (all gate names + FAIL markers) in one string.

All failure scenarios are SYNTHETIC — driven by monkeypatching each generator's
``baseline_path``/``build_inventory`` (mirroring how the existing ratchet tests drive the
shared ``regressions()`` with synthetic dicts). The real committed
``config-baseline.json`` / ``inert-surface-baseline.json`` / ``docs-lint-baseline.json`` are
never mutated.
