"""``suppressed`` is a claim about EFFECT, and only a kind with a surfacing gate has one.

Feedback-Signal computes a withholding set over every kind in :data:`feedback.PRODUCER_KINDS`, but
a membership result can only *do* something where a surfacing path consults it. Exactly one does:
``skills.surfacing.surface_skills`` withholds a matched skill whose identity is
``("skill_synthesis", <key>)``. The other five kinds — ``prompt``, ``loop_judge``,
``workflow_surfacing``, ``routing_pair``, ``app`` — keep surfacing and get the retire PROPOSAL only.

That distinction was invisible at the API boundary. ``GET /api/feedback/producers`` set
``suppressed: true`` for any below-threshold producer of ANY kind, and ``FeedbackPanel`` renders
that as a red pill titled *"Stopped surfacing"*. For five of six kinds it was untrue — and the
panel's own test fixture used a ``prompt``-kind row with ``suppressed: true`` as its worked example,
so the impossible shape was written into the tests too.

These tests pin the two halves that can drift apart:

1. :data:`feedback.ENFORCED_SUPPRESSION_KINDS` must match which kinds the CODE actually gates. If
   someone wires a second surfacing gate, or removes the one there is, without updating the
   constant, the API resumes lying in one direction or the other.
2. The route must not report an effect for an unenforced kind.
