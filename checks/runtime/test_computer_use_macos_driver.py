"""Rails for the macOS accessibility driver (`DCU-3`).

`DCU-4` shipped the dispatch, the ceilinged spawn and the snapshot store, and
``driver_host.resolve_driver`` has been importing ``gideon.computer_use.macos_driver`` and
finding **nothing** ever since. So the question this file answers is not "does a TTL work" —
``test_computer_use_dispatch.py`` already proves the dispatch-side TTL and fingerprint from both
sides — but the four things only the driver can get wrong:

1. **Does the capability now exist at its call site.** ``resolve_driver("Darwin")`` returning the
   module, and a handler present for every op the dispatch derives from the tool surface.
   :func:`test_every_dispatch_op_has_a_handler` derives the op names from ``TOOL_SURFACE`` rather
   than listing them, so a tool added later cannot quietly have no driver handler.
2. **Does the pointer stay still.** Asserted as the SET OF OS CALLS a given op makes, against a
   recording double for the FFI module — not as prose. An ``auto`` click that posted a mouse
   event would be visible as an extra recorded call, and
   :func:`test_the_pointer_rail_detects_a_mouse_event` proves the recording can fail.
3. **Does staleness fail closed at the moment of acting**, which is the one check the dispatch
   cannot make for itself: its own re-walk happens before the secure-field screen and the SEL
   row, so the window can move in between. Every refusal here is paired with a VACUITY case
   proving the same code path accepts a fresh index — a refusal test whose accept case is
   untested proves only that the function refuses everything.
4. **Does an absent framework refuse instead of exploding.** The driver is imported inside the
   gateway's own process, so a module-level framework load would turn "no desktop capability"
   into "no gateway".

**What ran for real on the authoring machine, and what did not.** ``op_list_apps``, the FFI
symbol binding, the real pointer read and the end-to-end spawn through ``computer_dispatch`` all
executed against the real OS. The AX-*driving* legs did not and cannot without a human grant:
``AXIsProcessTrusted()`` is False and macOS answers ``kAXErrorAPIDisabled`` (-25211), which is
itself asserted here as the real OS answer rather than mocked. Rather than mark those legs
skipped — a skipped surface reads like a pass —
:func:`test_the_accessibility_permission_refusal_is_the_real_os_answer` and
:func:`test_the_real_spawn_reaches_the_real_driver_and_its_code_survives` run UNCONDITIONALLY on
macOS and assert a different, meaningful end state on each side of the grant. Every AX-driving
behaviour is additionally proven against a recording double, so the logic is covered on a
machine where the OS will not cooperate.
