"""The working directory an ACP CLI is spawned with on the CONCURRENT (shared-connection)
path.

``ConversationDirectory._open_acp_concurrent`` resolved its fallback cwd as
``default_workspace_dir()`` and passed the result on unchanged. That helper returns ``""``
when it finds no safe root; ``AcpProcess`` does ``Path(work_dir)``; and ``Path("")`` is
``Path(".")``. So a session opened with no explicit cwd on a machine with no resolvable
workspace spawned its CLI in whatever directory the GATEWAY happened to be running in — a
repo checkout, ``/``, or whatever a service manager set. Same family as G39's real-home
escape (#1729): a containment decision falling through to an ambient value.

These rails assert the value that reaches the PROCESS, not a resolver's return:

* the ``cwd=`` kwarg ``pool.open_session`` receives, for each resolution outcome — with a
  vacuity floor (a resolvable workspace MUST arrive, or "nothing arrived" would pass every
  containment assertion here);
* and, as the proof that makes the refusal load-bearing, the ``cwd=`` a bare ``AcpProcess``
  puts on the sandbox handle's ``exec`` (i.e. on ``create_subprocess_exec``) when its
  work_dir is empty.

No test here spawns a real CLI, and every one pins BOTH ``GIDEON_HOME`` and
``GIDEON_WORKSPACE`` under ``tmp_path``: nothing may touch the real home.
