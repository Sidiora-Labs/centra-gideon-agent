"""Tests for loop-node convergence — the failure taxonomy, the escalation ladder, steering.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to break silently: a recoverable failure must
never burn an escalation rung (or a 429 surfaces a run that would have succeeded), and
every declared rung must be REACHABLE (a rung that can never be selected is dead
configuration that reads as a working feature).

**The decision under test moved (PP-15).** These cases used to drive
`loop_middleware.check_middleware` over a mutable `LoopState`; the decision is now
`loop.tick.evaluate` over a frozen `TickState`, and `check_middleware` is deleted. Every
behavioural assertion below is preserved — same thresholds, same rung order, same nudge
texts — but the ladder is now ADVANCED by the caller (`tick.applied`) instead of by the
decision itself, which is what makes the sequence reproducible rather than a function of how
many times the decision was called.
