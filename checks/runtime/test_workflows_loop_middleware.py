"""Tests for loop-node middleware — the breaker's next tier and the escalation ladder.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to break silently: a recoverable failure must
never burn an escalation rung (or a 429 surfaces a run that would have succeeded), and
every declared rung must be REACHABLE (a rung that can never be selected is dead
configuration that reads as a working feature).
