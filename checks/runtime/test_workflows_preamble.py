"""The grounding preamble (UP-R14, WF2UNI-11).

The preamble's whole job is to resolve identity deterministically and degrade honestly when it
cannot, so these tests assert both the resolved path (the injected resolver's entities land in the
first node) and the degraded path (no resolver → a name-only node that still carries the guard).
The topic split is asserted separately because it feeds a different subsystem — the grill's lookup
channels — and a merged assertion would hide which half broke.
