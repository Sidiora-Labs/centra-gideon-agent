"""`redact_credentials` was quadratic in one unbroken run of scheme characters (#2637).

Measured on `origin/main`, one unbroken alphanumeric token, each doubling ~4×:

    8 KB    0.029s          256 KB     30.475s
   16 KB    0.109s   (×3.7)
   32 KB    0.439s   (×4.0)
   64 KB    1.752s   (×4.0)

**The carrier was not the credential patterns.** Profiled at 64 KB, `.sub` on the old
single-regex `_URL_USERINFO_RE` — `([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.\\-]*://)([^/?#\\s@]+)@` — was 1.641s of
1.648s, **99.6%**. `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS`, the obvious suspect, was 0.004s (0.2%); the base64 pass
was 0.002s. A backtracking engine attempts the match at every offset, and at each one that
variable-length scheme run re-scans the rest of the run before failing for want of a `://`.

Why that is a *user-visible* defect and not a slow function: `redact_credentials` sits on live turn
paths — `acp/translate.py` alone redacts five fields per agent message — so one tool result carrying
a long hash, a minified line, or a base64 blob bought seconds of dead air per message, with nothing
to distinguish "the model is thinking" from "the app is wedged".

The fix anchors the scan on `://` and recovers the scheme by walking backward, which is why the
whole of this file is a **differential** test: the obvious alternative fix — capping the run length
and masking anything over the cap — would have been worse for the common case. A long run that IS a
credential is already replaced whole; a long run that is innocuous (a base64 image, a minified
bundle) is preserved verbatim, and a cap would silently mask it. So the requirement here is not
"still redacts credentials", it is **byte-identical output on every input**, and the pre-#2637
implementation is kept below as the oracle that proves it.

Two facts carry the equivalence, and `TestTheEquivalenceRestsOnTwoFacts` pins both:

  * `:` is not a scheme character, so the run of scheme characters ending at a `://` can only be
    the maximal one — every shorter split the old form backtracked through was a guaranteed failure.
  * `@` is not a userinfo character, so the userinfo run can only be followed by `@` at its
    maximal length, which is what makes the possessive `++` free.
