"""Item-similarity edges (KL-13) — the schema, the store queries and the kNN pass.

The store had no similarity-derived edge of any kind: the chunk vector index was queried at
read time and never materialised. These tests target the five ways a materialised similarity
graph goes quietly wrong, in order of how badly each bites:

* **A recompute that eats its neighbours' work.** Canonical (min, max) storage means an edge
  item B discovered is stored with A as its *source* whenever A < B, so a
  `DELETE WHERE source_item_id = A` before re-inserting destroys B's finding — and the
  both-legs delete destroys every neighbour's. `test_recompute_keeps_the_edge_the_other_pass_found`
  runs it in BOTH id orderings, because a fix that only works when A > B passes a single-ordering
  test by luck.
* **A backlog that cannot drain.** Keyed on "has no edges" it never terminates: an item may
  legitimately have no neighbour above the floor, so it never gains an edge, never leaves the
  backlog, and the host — which re-invokes a batched pass until it returns 0 — spends every
  sub-batch on the head of the library. `test_drain_reaches_zero_even_when_no_edge_is_ever_written`
  is that assertion, and it is deliberately run with a floor nothing clears.
* **A per-pass truncation posing as a cap.** Top-K bounds what ONE item writes and says
  nothing about 500 items each writing one edge at the same popular document.
  `test_degree_cap_bounds_inbound_edges_globally` measures the uncapped degree first, so the
  capped assertion cannot pass on a setup that never exceeded the cap.
* **A roll-up that is not MAX.** `test_item_pair_score_is_the_max_of_its_chunk_pairs` picks
  chunk scores whose mean and sum are both distinguishable from the max, and keeps the floor
  low enough that a mean implementation is not rescued by filtering.
* **CASCADE as decoration.** SQLite ignores foreign keys unless `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` is
  set per connection, so DDL that reads correctly can enforce nothing.
  `test_deleting_an_item_cascades_its_edges_with_no_application_code` asserts the pragma AND
  deletes the item with raw SQL, bypassing `delete_item` entirely.

Every negative assertion carries a positive control in the same test, so a query that returns
nothing fails loudly instead of passing on an empty set.
