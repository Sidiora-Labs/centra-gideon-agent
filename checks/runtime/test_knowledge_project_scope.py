"""Knowledge project tagging + the sharing-policy filter (WORK-CONTAINERS §1.6 — WF2WOR-11).

Knowledge stays ONE global library; a project is a tag plus item metadata. What is tested
here is the writer/reader pair that makes that scoping real:

* **Writer** — the `knowledge-persist` action provider stamps `project_id` / `run_id` /
  `sharing_policy` on what a run writes AND files the item under its project's tag.
* **Reader (brief)** — `session_brief.load_items` reads items BY that tag. Before this atom
  nothing wrote it, so the project brief was a live reader of a key no writer produced: it
  returned nothing for every project, silently. That is asserted here as an outcome.
* **Reader (view)** — `project_scope.project_items` (served through
  `GET /api/projects/{id}/linked`) shows a project its own items whatever their policy, plus
  other projects' `shared` items labeled with their source project. Another project's
  PRIVATE items never appear — the policy field's teeth.

`sharing_policy` is a CLOSED enum and is enumerated exhaustively; an unrecognised value
fails CLOSED (private), because the only safe reading of unknown intent for a visibility
control is "do not surface it elsewhere".
