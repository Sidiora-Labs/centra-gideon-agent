"""A truncated completion is reported as truncation, not as a missing argument.

Nothing in the LLM layer inspected a completion's stop reason for truncation. A response cut at
``max_tokens`` was accepted as a complete answer, and a tool call whose arguments were cut
mid-stream became ``{}`` — so the tool's own validation told the model it had **omitted a required
argument for a call it had made correctly**.

That misattribution is worse than a visible error. There was no retry, no counter and no event, so
it was invisible in the ledger and in any transcript review (issue 1773).

The pieces that were already there and unused:

* ``LLMEvent.stop_reason`` was declared in ``llm/events.py``. ``llm/anthropic.py`` never wrote it,
  and ``llm/openai.py`` read ``finish_reason`` only to decide when to flush — ``"length"`` was
  never a case, so a truncated call fell through to the DEFENSIVE flush with no indication.
* ``FailureMode.TOKEN_OVERFLOW`` and its correction note ("Your previous response was too long and
  was cut off…") existed with **zero writers** anywhere in ``src/``. This closes an inert control
  rather than adding a new one.

🪤 THE ISSUE NAMES THE FALSE GREEN AND IT IS RIGHT: *"assert the call site, not just the helper."*
A tolerant ``read_tool_arguments`` proves nothing on its own — the defect was that the runtime
collapsed its answer. So the legs below drive ``_prepare_call`` and ``_unrunnable_result``, which is
where the observation the model actually receives is decided.

**What this deliberately does NOT do: retry.** The issue's step 2 asks for one. ``FailureMode``
belongs to ``ModelCallGuard``, which owns the retry machinery (``is_retryable``,
``correction_note``, ``NON_RETRYABLE``) — and the native agent loop does not go through it, so
retrying here means wiring the loop into the guard. That is new control flow with cost and
loop-interaction consequences, not a wiring fix, and it is filed separately. What ships here is the
part that makes the failure TRUE: the model is told what actually happened.
