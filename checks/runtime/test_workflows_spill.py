"""The `result_omitted` spill boundary at the journal write (WF2-R11).

A node output crosses three boundaries after it is produced: a journal line every later read
re-parses, a `{{nodes.x.output}}` binding a downstream node interpolates, and an SSE frame a
browser renders. An output that is fine to KEEP can be ruinous to carry inline across all
three — so the journal spills it to a file and leaves a typed stub.

Two reasons, and the second is the one a size check alone misses:

* `oversize` — past 64KB, the same boundary the live chat sanitizer uses;
* `binary` — a magic-prefix match. A 400-byte PNG is under every threshold and still
  meaningless inline: mojibake in the widget, a poisoned binding, wasted context if it
  reaches a model.

The invariant across both: nothing is ever LOST. The full value is always written to the
output file first, and the stub names the ref, so spilling costs a reader one extra read and
never the data.
