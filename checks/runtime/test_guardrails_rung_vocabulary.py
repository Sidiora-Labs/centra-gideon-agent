"""A rung a USER reads is named by its label, never by its code key.

`RUNG_LABELS`' own docstring draws the line: *"runs on its own" is what a user needs to know;
"autonomous" is what the code calls it.* Four sentences a person reads were on the wrong side of
it, in three modules:

    rungs.route_action_type      "action.create_task resolves draft_only"
                                 → the BODY of the inbox row a held action raises
                                   ("The 'create_task' action on trigger t-1 did not run: …"),
                                   and the trigger's recorded outcome error
    rungs.route_action_type      "…, narrowed to auto_with_undo by the cautious profile"
    autonomy.promotion_eligibility  "Already at its ceiling (autonomous)."
                                 → the Guardrails panel's `record` line, on twelve rows
    ladder.explain_refused_grant "…can never go above one_tap — that is its declared ceiling."
                                 → the 400 body a refused promotion click shows

This file is the ratchet for the rule, driven through the real composers rather than asserted
against a hand-built object, plus the four MACHINE-facing sites that deliberately keep the key.

🪤 Assert the exact rung KEYS, never a word from one. Action-type keys contain rung-ish words
(`inbox.reply_draft` has "draft"), so a substring rule on "draft" would fail on a correct sentence.
