"""The three traversal instances `record_ids` did not reach (#655, #430, #739).

The unvalidated-id-to-path class was closed by :mod:`gideon.record_ids` for the stores that
name a record ``<dir>/<id>``. These three are the same class reached differently, so the primitive
alone did not cover them:

* **#655** — ``POST /api/reveal`` was the ONE files endpoint that skipped
  ``_validate_dashboard_path``, so ``/etc/hosts`` and another instance's home both answered 200. It
  gains nothing from the blocked-basename work either, because that lives *inside* the function it
  bypassed — and it is the endpoint that hands a path to ``open``/``xdg-open``, i.e. to the host's
  default handler for whatever it is.
* **#430** — the git read endpoints resolved a repository by looking for ``.git``, accepted it as a
  FILE (git's standard gitfile pointer), and then validated **the pointer's location** rather than
  the **resolved gitdir**. The containment check ran on every request and measured the wrong path.
  The dashboard will even write the pointer for you: ``.git`` is not a blocked basename.
* **#739** — skill install validated every *file* path for ``..`` and left the *directory name* they
  are all written into unchecked. A safe relative path under an unsafe root is an unsafe path.

**And a fourth, found here rather than reported:** the QUARANTINE directory is named from
``detail.name`` too, and it escaped *before* ``scan_dir`` ran — so the supply-chain gate could not
refuse a write it had not yet been asked about.
