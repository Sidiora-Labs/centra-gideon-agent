"""S68 — generalized autopause, parking, quarantine, and Runs-inbox surfacing (§3.7).

The plan says autopause-after-5 ALREADY EXISTS for the cron action path and that the substrate
generalizes it. So this suite starts from what the shipped one does, measured by driving it:
`RuntimeCoordinator._maybe_autopause` increments one counter at all four of its call sites with no
notion of WHY the fire failed, so **five consecutive denylist blocks disable the trigger** — a
policy the operator configured on purpose, read as five failures.

`test_a_policy_refusal_never_spends_the_budget` is the regression for that. The rest pin the
distinctions that make the generalization worth having: an outage parks (reversible), a config error
pauses at once (retrying cannot help), and only a true failure spends the budget.
