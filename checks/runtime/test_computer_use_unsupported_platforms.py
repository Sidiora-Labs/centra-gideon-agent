"""Rails for `DCU-6` — the honest Windows/Linux platform story.

The atom's clause is *"on non-macOS, every computer-use tool returns a typed refusal naming the
platform; no silent no-op"*, and the thing that makes it hard to prove is that it is a statement
about platforms this suite does not run on. So the shape of this file is deliberate:

* **What is REAL here (macOS, no simulation).** That ``DRIVER_MODULES``'s Windows and Linux
  entries now resolve to importable modules — before this atom they named nothing and
  ``resolve_driver`` answered ``None`` — and that importing either on macOS touches no OS
  library. Both are real properties of a real macOS run and both are the reason the rest can be
  measured at all: a driver that raised at import would take the *gateway* down, not the tool
  (``resolve_driver`` runs inside the gateway's own process).
* **What is SIMULATED, and how narrowly.** Only ``platform.system()``. Every other participant is
  the shipped one: the real ``computer_dispatch``, the real keystone document, the real
  ``policy``/``gate`` screens, the real SEL, the real ``create_subprocess_limited`` ceilinged
  spawn, a real separate child process running the real ``driver_host.main`` over the real stdio
  JSON protocol, and the real ``_run_driver`` translation that decides whether a child's code
  survives. The end-to-end leg fakes ``platform.system`` *inside the child* (via the argv the
  dispatch spawns) rather than in this process, because a parent-side monkeypatch cannot reach
  across ``fork``/``exec`` — patching it here and asserting a subprocess result would be a test
  that measures nothing.
* **Every guard has a vacuity assertion.** A refusal that fires everywhere is not a platform
  refusal, it is a broken driver: each Windows/Linux assertion below has a Darwin twin through
  the same code path confirming the refusal does *not* fire there. Those twins **simulate**
  Darwin rather than requiring it, because this suite runs on a macOS developer machine *and* on
  a Linux CI runner — and CI is the only place the Windows/Linux rows are enforced without
  someone watching, so a floor that skipped there would read as a pass while proving nothing.
  The one leg that genuinely cannot be faked — a real macOS ``run_op`` — is host-gated and says
  so.

**The child is pinned to THIS tree.** ``sys.path`` is seeded with this repository's ``src`` in
the spawned child rather than trusting the ambient install. A venv whose editable install points
at a different checkout would otherwise silently run *that* tree's ``driver_host`` — which has no
Windows driver — and the test would fail (or pass) for a reason that has nothing to do with the
code under test. It is the same hazard
``test_the_driver_argv_names_the_child_module_and_this_interpreter`` exists to name.
