"""EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE ES-5 — what DRIVES a pre-registered template study (§2).

`test_evals_studies.py` covers the instrument. This file covers the two `done_when` clauses
the instrument could not satisfy on its own, and it covers them at the CALL SITE rather than
at the mechanism — because "the mechanism exists and nothing invokes it" is the exact defect
this atom was reopened for.

* **"a flywheel template-diff RUNS a pre-registered study"** →
  `test_filing_a_template_diff_PRE_REGISTERS_a_study` asserts on
  `refiner_tools.file_template_diff`'s own return and on the registration landing on disk,
  and `test_run_study_uses_the_PRODUCTION_arm_runner_by_default` asserts the default
  `arm_runner` is reached when the caller supplies none — the asymmetry with
  `caller=live_judge_caller` that made a template arm unexecutable.
* **"over the harvested suite"** → `test_the_suite_comes_from_the_HARVEST` builds cases from
  a real installed harvested library, and `test_an_empty_harvest_is_a_REFUSAL...` proves the
  `EmptyHarvestError` path is neither a crash nor a silent zero-case green.

Every negative assertion here carries a vacuity floor, in both directions:
`assert_arms_differ` is proved to RAISE on identical arms AND to pass on differing ones, and
the flywheel hook's best-effort guard is proved to actually swallow (`study_id == ""` with
the proposal still filed) rather than being decorative.
