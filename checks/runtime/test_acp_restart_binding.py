"""G5 — a gateway restart must not silently change a session's runtime.

The gap as filed had four claims. Three were about persistence (``acp_provider``,
``workspace_dir``, ``task_mode``) and one about resume (``resume_sid is None`` with no
``session/load`` attempted). This module rails all four, plus the thing that actually
matters when a binding genuinely cannot be restored: the turn must SAY SO.

Every restart test drives the real pair of code paths rather than asserting on a dict:
the end-of-turn save (``save_session_to_history``, which rebuilds the whole metadata
line from the in-memory session and is what silently clobbered the bind endpoint's own
write) and the startup bulk restore (``restore_recent_sessions``, which is the path a
restart takes and the one that used to skip the runtime binding entirely). A test that
only checked "the key is in the meta dict" would have passed on a half-fix: the reader
lived in the OTHER restore path, so the key was written and then never read back.
