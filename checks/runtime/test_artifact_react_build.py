"""PEP-9 — the React artifact build path: static output, the resource ceiling, and a
failure that is REPORTED rather than swallowed or hung.

The clauses this file exists to hold, each asserted at the CALL SITE rather than by
exercising the mechanism in isolation:

* **The build rides the resource-limited spawn.** Two independent proofs. (1) The argv
  actually handed to the OS at the build's one spawn is inspected: it must be the
  post-exec shim carrying the ``build`` profile's own policy, with the bundler after
  ``--``. (2) The *child* is asked what ceiling it received — the test lowers its own
  soft ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` to a literal it supplies, so "the child reports something other
  than that literal, namely its hard limit" is evidence the shim ran, and the baseline
  (the same stub spawned raw) proves the literal is what a child sees WITHOUT the shim.
  That is the vacuity floor: the pinned value comes from the child, the floor comes from
  a number this file chose.

* **The build never reaches the network.** The toolchain is discovered, never installed:
  a host with no toolchain gets a refusal, and the argv census asserts no install verb
  and no URL can appear in the one command that runs.

* **A failure is reported, not swallowed.** A non-zero bundler, a bundler that writes
  nothing, and a bundler that never finishes each raise with the reason in the sentence;
  the deploy route turns that into a 422 whose body is what ``errText`` shows the user;
  and in every failing case NOTHING is published — no served files, no registry row.

The bundler is stubbed with a tiny ``sh`` script for every test here, because the real
esbuild lives in ``node_modules`` (absent in a fresh clone, and never a test dependency).
The real toolchain path is exercised by hand and recorded in the plan's execution log.
