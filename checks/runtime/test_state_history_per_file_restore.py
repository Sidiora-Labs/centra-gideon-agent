"""DAS-9 — per-file time travel: restoring ONE note, not the whole tree.

Criterion 6 wants the memory tree restorable from the panel. Whole-root
rollback/revert already did that for a root; this covers the subset half, and the
rails here exist because the subset is exactly where the panel's copy can quietly
become false:

* the panel promises **rollback discards later edits, revert keeps them**. That
  distinction is asserted for the same target, in the same fixture, from the same
  starting state — because the cheap wrong implementation of a per-file revert
  ("check out the parent for those paths") passes every test that only checks
  "did the file change?" while turning revert into rollback;
* an unknown or escaping path must RAISE. A silently-dropped path is a restore the
  user believes happened and did not, so the "changes nothing" half is asserted
  too: no commit, and no parked service ref;
* whole-root behaviour must be byte-identical for BOTH ``paths=None`` and
  ``paths=[]`` — a shipped surface calls it that way. Asserted by proving the
  hard-reset shape (HEAD lands ON the target, the commit count DROPS), which a
  subset implementation cannot fake since it ADDS a commit;
* the gitignored-secret claim has to survive the new mechanism, including the
  "never runs ``git clean``" half. That one is asserted over the module's syntax
  tree rather than its text, so the prose in the docstring that discusses ``git
  clean`` cannot make the rail pass or fail for the wrong reason.

Every test runs against an isolated home AND an isolated workspace: with no
seeded workspace the memory root would be a git repository over the developer's
real ``~/workplace``.
