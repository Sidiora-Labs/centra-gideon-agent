"""The rail for the decoy-``command``-argument class (#443).

**The class.** ``command`` is an ordinary argument name. ``extract_bash_command`` reads a
``command`` key out of *any* tool's arguments, and every decision that wanted "the shell
command this call will run" called it directly — so a destructive tool that happened to
carry a ``command`` key was judged by a string that was never going to be executed.

Two independent gates consumed it, and only the first was reported:

* :func:`resolve_effective_risk` → ``"safe"`` → **auto-approved with no prompt** under
  ``trust_reads``, which is a shipped approval mode and what ``--test-mode`` selects.
* :func:`task_mode_denies` → ``""`` → the tool was **allowed to run** in ``ask``,
  ``plan`` and ``build`` mode, whose entire contract is that mutations do not.

Both reduce to one question — *is this call a shell invocation?* — which nothing owned.
:func:`is_shell_invocation` owns it now, and this suite is the guard on the property that
matters: **no argument a caller can add may lower a tool's risk or unlock it.**

**Why the tests are written as an attack over every gate, not per-function.** The first
fix for this bug moved the extraction from :func:`resolve_effective_risk` into
:func:`classify_invocation` and left it unscoped, so the bypass survived a rewrite that
looked like a fix. A test naming one function would have gone green. So the core test
sweeps the decoy across *every* consumer at once.
