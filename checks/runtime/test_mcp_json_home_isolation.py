"""Every `mcp.json` resolver honours `GIDEON_HOME` — all three of them.

The dashboard's `_canonical_mcp_json()` was fixed to use `config_dir()`, and its comment says
the old `Path.home()` hardcode "ignored it". Three siblings kept the bug:

* `mcp_client._gideon_mcp_specs` — **the store the native agent loop spawns from**
* `mcp_discovery._MCP_SOURCES` — a module-level tuple, so frozen at IMPORT time
* `dashboard/handlers/mcp._GIDEON_MCP_JSON` — likewise a module-level constant

What that cost, concretely: under `GIDEON_HOME=./.dev-home` the dashboard wrote
`.dev-home/mcp.json` while the reader that actually spawns servers read the operator's REAL
`~/.gideon/mcp.json`. So a dev session loaded the operator's live MCP servers **and their
credentials**, and every dev-side edit looked like it did nothing.

These tests assert the CALL SITES agree, not that a helper exists — and the import-time half
matters most: a constant computed before the env var is set cannot be fixed by setting it later,
which is why the two former constants are now functions.
