"""PathGuard: the `paths` capability, compared as paths rather than strings (decision 7 — S118).

🔴 THE DEFECT. `paths` has been a fail-closed member of `CAPABILITY_KEYS` since S69 and is
rendered as a fence in the UI — but `capability_allows` compared it with `_matches_entry`, which
is prefix matching built for tool names like `mcp__github__*`. Measured against the real function
before a line was written, with the allowlist `["/Users/me/notes/*"]`:

    ALLOW  /Users/me/notes/../../.ssh/id_rsa        # 🔴 traversal, permitted
    ALLOW  /Users/me/notes/../.aws/credentials      # 🔴 traversal, permitted

So a trigger fenced to a notes directory could reach an SSH key, and the ledger would record the
fire as permitted. The fence was not weak — it was measuring the wrong thing.

Every path case here is built on REAL files and REAL symlinks under `tmp_path`. A test asserting
against string literals would be testing the same wrong model the bug came from.
