"""Project-scoped memory locality (WORK-CONTAINERS §1.6 — WF2WOR-11).

Two claims, both driven through the production paths rather than asserted on helpers:

1. **A project-owned run's memory is project-local.** The run controller binds the project's
   `context_dir` as the stage cwd, and memory is cwd-partitioned — so what the run writes
   lands under `workspace/_ext/<slug(context_dir)>` instead of the shared `_ext/_default`
   pile every project's runs would otherwise stir together. Driven by running a real
   controller to completion and then writing through the store `get_memory_for` resolves.

2. **Recall is partition-first, and locality is ORDERING ONLY — never admission.** A
   project-local session recalls from its own partition first, then from the global
   partition, whose hits are source-labeled and fenced. The load-bearing case is the
   inverse one: when the local partition has NOTHING and the global partition has the
   answer, the global hit still comes back. A locality rule that dropped it would delete a
   real recall result, which from the user's chair is indistinguishable from memory loss.
