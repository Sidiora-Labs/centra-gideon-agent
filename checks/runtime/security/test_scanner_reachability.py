"""Execution-reachability scoping of the scanner's DANGEROUS band (issues #2526, #2625).

The rule under test is stated in full in ``supply_chain.py``'s reachability section. In
one sentence: a DANGEROUS match is re-scored to WARNING **iff** the analysis can PROVE the
match cannot execute — either because it is commentary the interpreter discards (L0,
#2625) or because it is a string nothing in the bundle can run (L1-L5, #2526). Anything
else — a clause that refuses, a file that will not parse, a blob with no bundle around it
— stays DANGEROUS.

The shape of this file follows from what would make the change worthless. A change that
only proved the false positives went away would not have shown the rule still catches
anything, so the bulk of this file is attacks on the rule, each asserting the finding
STAYS DANGEROUS and each asserting WHICH clause refused it — a clause that silently
stops working therefore reds the suite rather than quietly widening the hole. Two of
those attacks are the ones that matter most: a literal that genuinely reaches an
execution sink, and a literal that is assembled into a bigger string at runtime and
*then* executed (the case argument-position tracking would miss, and the reason the
sink test is stated at module scope).

``TestRedsOnAWeakenedCheck`` is the mutation half: it neuters one clause at a time, in
process via monkeypatch, and asserts the matching rail fails. The shipped scanner is
never weakened.
