"""#2607 — the RECALL rail for ``SkillScanner``'s terminal (DANGEROUS) band.

The adversarial corpus (``test_scanner_adversarial.py``) and the 64-bundle corpus scan
both assert *precision*: that benign, first-party content is not refused. Nothing asserted
the opposite direction — that the scanner still **catches** anything — so the terminal band
could rot to nothing and every suite would stay green. It did rot: ``destructive_root``,
the flagship rule, could not fire inside a quoted string for as long as it had shipped,
because its trailing anchor demanded whitespace, ``;`` or end-of-input after the target and
a closing quote is none of those. ``os.system("rm -rf /")`` installed behind a consentable
warning; the same call with one trailing space was terminal. This file is the rail that
would have caught that, and it is written to keep catching the same class of thing.

Two properties make it a rail rather than a list of examples:

* **Both spellings, always.** Every rule is asserted in a bare shell file AND embedded in a
  quoted string inside a ``.py`` file with a real execution sink. Passing only the bare form
  is precisely what let the anchor defect survive, so the embedded form is not optional.
* **Completeness is enforced.** ``test_every_dangerous_rule_has_a_recall_fixture`` fails if
  a rule is added to ``_DANGEROUS_SCRIPT`` without a payload here, so the rail cannot fall
  behind the catalog silently.

The rail found a second defect of a DIFFERENT class on its first run, and #2610 closed it
here: ``disk_wipe``'s ``> /dev/sdX`` branch was dead code because its word boundary was
hoisted outside the alternation. That one failed identically bare and embedded — a
LEADING-boundary bug, not #2607's trailing anchor — which is why the two are asserted by
separate classes rather than folded together.

Every payload below is genuinely malicious — that is the point. Nothing here is executed:
each is written into ``tmp_path`` as inert bytes and handed to the static gate.

The file's original scope note said it deliberately asserted nothing about destruction
spelled in the HOST LANGUAGE (``shutil.rmtree``, ``Path.unlink``, ``os.remove``, truncating
``open(..., "w")``), because the tier for that class was an open owner decision and encoding
a verdict would have settled by test what had not been settled by judgement. **The owner has
now ruled: native destruction gets the same TERMINAL severity as shell destruction.** So the
gap is closed rather than tracked, and :class:`TestNativeDestructionIsTerminal` and the
classes after it are the rail for it — measured from the same six-payload table #2607 reports,
in both directions (recall AND the precision floor that keeps the terminal band off ordinary
cleanup code).

    the list rather than quietly outliving its fix. An unmarked comment would not do that.

    Two gaps have been retired that way: ``disk_wipe``'s redirect branch (#2610), now asserted
    positively in :class:`TestTheDiskWipeRedirectBranchIsReachable`, and native destruction
    (#2607 direction 2), now asserted in :class:`TestNativeDestructionIsTerminal`.

    The two that remain are the SHELL band's, not the native family's, and the distinction is
    why landing the AST rules did not close them: both spell ``rm -rf /`` for a shell to run,
    so the destructive call is ``rm``'s and there is no Python call site naming a target for
    the native rules to classify. Closing them wants the same AST treatment applied to the
    ARGUMENTS of an execution sink — a different rule from the ones this file now asserts.
