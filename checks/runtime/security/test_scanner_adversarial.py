"""SH-5 — the adversarial corpus harness against ``SkillScanner`` / ``install_scanned``.

Six attack classes, stored one directory per class under ``checks/runtime/security/corpus/``.
Five were named by SECURITY-HARDENING S3/C3; ``baseline-tamper`` was added by SH-7:

* ``archive`` — zip-slip / absolute-path / mid-path traversal / case-collision.
* ``integrity-race`` — the scanned-bytes == installed-bytes invariant under a
  concurrent swap, plus post-install tamper.
* ``verdict-evasion`` — obfuscated or split dangerous idioms, trust-tier laundering,
  ``force`` against the non-overridable floor.
* ``invisible-char`` — bidi overrides and zero-width token splitting.
* ``degenerate-manifest`` — oversized blobs and manifests that parse to nonsense.
* ``baseline-tamper`` (SH-7) — the packaged command denylist itself under attack: a
  self-consistent rewrite of ``baseline_denylist.json``, a digest mismatch, an empty
  pattern list, an in-process ``.clear()``, and the no-trusted-source-left state where
  the live list, the snapshot and the file are all unverifiable at once. Each case
  asserts the same triple — **detected, audited, still enforcing** — because a tamper
  that raises but is never logged, or is logged but shrinks what gets refused, is not
  actually defended.

Every corpus case is inert data: a JSON description of a payload. Nothing under
``corpus/`` is ever executed — the harness materializes each payload into ``tmp_path``
and feeds it to the gate. A case's ``expect`` names the refusal being asserted, so a
fixture that is added without being wired to an assertion turns
``TestCorpusIsComplete`` red rather than passing silently.

The last class, ``TestCorpusRedsOnAWeakenedScanner``, is the meta-test for the atom's
red-on-weakness clause (plan V3): it weakens one control per class **in process, via
monkeypatch**, and asserts the corresponding corpus assertion now fails. The shipped
scanner is never weakened; ``docs/security/SCANNER_TESTING.md`` records the equivalent
on-disk mutation for anyone reproducing it by hand.
