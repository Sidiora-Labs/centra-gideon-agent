"""SH-5 — the adversarial corpus harness against ``SkillScanner`` / ``install_scanned``.

Five attack classes, named by SECURITY-HARDENING S3/C3 and stored one directory per
class under ``tests/security/corpus/``:

* ``archive`` — zip-slip / absolute-path / mid-path traversal / case-collision.
* ``integrity-race`` — the scanned-bytes == installed-bytes invariant under a
  concurrent swap, plus post-install tamper.
* ``verdict-evasion`` — obfuscated or split dangerous idioms, trust-tier laundering,
  ``force`` against the non-overridable floor.
* ``invisible-char`` — bidi overrides and zero-width token splitting.
* ``degenerate-manifest`` — oversized blobs and manifests that parse to nonsense.

Every corpus case is inert data: a JSON description of a payload. Nothing under
``corpus/`` is ever executed — the harness materializes each payload into ``tmp_path``
and feeds it to the gate. A case's ``expect`` names the refusal being asserted, so a
fixture that is added without being wired to an assertion turns
``TestCorpusIsComplete`` red rather than passing silently.

The last class, ``TestCorpusRedsOnAWeakenedScanner``, is the meta-test for the atom's
red-on-weakness clause (plan V3): it weakens one control per class **in process, via
monkeypatch**, and asserts the corresponding corpus assertion now fails. The shipped
scanner is never weakened; ``docs/security/scanner-testing.md`` records the equivalent
on-disk mutation for anyone reproducing it by hand.
