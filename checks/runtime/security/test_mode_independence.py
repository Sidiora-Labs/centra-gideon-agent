"""SH-7 — the mode-independence matrix for the baseline command denylist.

The claim under test is a single sentence: **no approval mode, and no trust simulator,
can let a baseline-denied command run.** SH-6 made the denylist unshrinkable (packaged
data + integrity re-assert); this file proves the *enforcement* is not conditional on
who said yes.

Three things live here, one per clause of the atom:

1. **The matrix** (:class:`TestApprovalModeMatrix`, :class:`TestTrustSimulatorMatrix`).
   Every approval mode the native runtime honours — ``default`` (per-tool gate, and the
   human APPROVES), ``auto``, ``yolo``, ``acceptEdits`` — plus both trust simulators
   (channel ``!yolo on`` and the dashboard trust toggle) drives a REAL
   ``NativeBuiltinToolProvider`` bash tool through a REAL ``NativeAgentRuntime`` and must
   come back refused with nothing spawned. ``yolo`` is the interesting cell: the approval
   gate is fully open there, so a refusal can only come from the denylist.

2. **The ordering pin** (:class:`TestDenyPrecedesTheApprovalGate`). Two independent
   rails: a behavioural one (a hard-denied tool never reaches ``_invoke`` under
   ``default``, where the gate would otherwise fire and a human approval would let it
   through) and a structural one (the deny block *lexically precedes* the
   ``_requires_approval`` call inside ``_guard_and_invoke``, read by AST, not by regex).
   Moving the deny below the gate turns both red — the structural rail immediately, the
   behavioural one because ``_guard_and_invoke`` returns the ``_NEEDS_APPROVAL`` sentinel
   before reaching the deny, and the gated path then invokes without re-screening.

3. **The vacuity floor** (:class:`TestTheProbeIsRealNotVacuous`). A command that matched
   nothing would pass every cell above forever. So the probe command is proven to match a
   pattern that is in the *packaged baseline* (not a user addition), the benign control is
   proven to match nothing, and the neighbouring sensitive-path guard is proven NOT to be
   the control that fires — otherwise this file would be silently testing that instead.

**Known gap, deliberately pinned rather than papered** (see
:meth:`TestDenyPrecedesTheApprovalGate.test_command_denylist_is_enforced_below_the_gate`):
the *command*-level baseline screen lives inside the bash tool
(``builtin_tools.py``), which is BELOW the runtime's approval gate. It is unconditional
and precedes the spawn, so there is no execution bypass — the matrix proves that. But a
baseline-denied command is still put in front of a human as an approvable request before
being refused. That rail records today's ordering so the gap is visible rather than
assumed; it is a legibility/audit defect, not a hole.
