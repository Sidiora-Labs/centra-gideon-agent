"""Scheduled research reports — definition round-trip and hardened dueness (WF2KNO-12).

Each of the five rules named in ``knowledge/research_reports.py``'s docstring gets a
test here. They are regression tests for scheduling bugs that are invisible in a demo
and obvious in production: firing at 1970, firing fifty times after a laptop nap,
skipping a window after a transient failure, and skipping an item forever because the
watermark was stamped at completion.

Tests that call ``record_run`` anchor their simulated clock on the real one, because
``record_run`` stamps ``time.time()`` by design (rule 3) — a synthetic "now" far from
the wall clock would make the recorded run look either ancient or far in the future.
