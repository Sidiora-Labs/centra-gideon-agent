"""LEARN-R4's `surfacing_events` table, its writer, and the call site that reaches it.

**The defect this file guards against is the one it was built to fix.** `surfacing_events` was
named by three consumers and created by none — no schema, no reader, no writer. Shipping a schema
with no reachable writer would reproduce that exact shape one layer down, so the anchor test here
does not test the store: it drives the REAL ``PromptAssembler.build_message`` path and asserts a row
lands, and its companion asserts that a turn which surfaces nothing writes nothing. A test that
reads zero rows from an empty table passes for the wrong reason, so every count assertion below has
a positive and a negative through the same code path.
