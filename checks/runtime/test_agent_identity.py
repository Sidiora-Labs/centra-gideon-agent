"""Agent identity resolution — the canonical "which agent is this turn?" rule.

These cases were in `test_workflows_composition.py`, which WORKFLOWS-V2 Phase 1
deletes wholesale. The rule itself is not workflow-specific (chat_runner stamps every
turn's `resolved_agent_id` with it), so it keeps its coverage here rather than
disappearing with the feature that happened to need it first.
