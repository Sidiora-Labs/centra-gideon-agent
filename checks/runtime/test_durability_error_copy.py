"""Crash outcomes speak guidance, not internals (audit: raw str(exc) as user copy).

A broad ``except Exception`` catch is where a traceback's last words used to become the
wire ``message`` on the durability import/restore routes — the two most trust-sensitive
flows the product has. These rails pin the split the handlers now implement:

* a CRASH answers 500 with a registered code and a way forward ("check the gateway
  log"), and the exception text goes to the log and the audit row — never the wire;
* a DESIGNED refusal is unaffected — restore's refusals travel as ``ok: false`` result
  values on the 200/409 path, and the knowledge store's authored ``ValueError`` texts
  ("no such item …") still pass through verbatim.

Tested at the route, like the sibling DSAR tests: the leak lived in the handler's
catch, so calling the service function directly would prove nothing.
