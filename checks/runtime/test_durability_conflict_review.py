"""The conflict review surface: the resolve primitive and its two routes (DAS-10, §4.2).

Every conflict in this file is seeded through the REAL detector
(:func:`durability.conflicts.detect_conflicts`) against a REAL inventory entry, never by
hand-building a record. That is the vacuity floor for the whole file: an assertion that the
queue lists "no conflicts" would pass against a broken detector, a broken queue and an empty
home alike, so each list assertion pins a non-zero count of a record the detector produced.

The one measured fact this surface is shaped around: **no memory- or knowledge-domain entry
can produce a conflict record today** — see
``test_no_memory_or_knowledge_entry_can_currently_conflict``. So the review screen is the
Durability one, and the memory/knowledge surfaces exist as routing + counts rather than as
two screens built for a population of zero.
