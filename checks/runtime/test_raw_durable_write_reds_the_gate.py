"""PHF-7: a deliberately raw call that skips the enforced helper REDS the gate.

The enforced helper is ``atomic_write`` (``runtime/gideon/core/atomic_write.py``) — the one
implementation that keeps the post-write history seam and fsync durability intact. A handler
that rolls its own ``mkstemp`` + ``os.replace`` lands the bytes on disk and fires no hook, so
the write is swallowed with a green test on BOTH sides (DAS-9). ``structural-duplication``'s
``durable-write`` family is what makes that shape expensive.

This file exists because that clause is a **vacuity assertion about the gate**, and the gate's
own suite cannot make it. ``checks/runtime/test_structural_baseline.py`` pins the *detector* against
synthetic trees (``gen._durable_write_sites(tree) == [...]``) — one level too shallow. A
detector can be perfect while the gate reds on nothing.

MEASURED, not argued. Replacing the ``("durable-write", _durable_write_sites)`` tuple in
``scan_duplicates``'s dispatch with ``lambda tree: []`` and then regenerating
``checks/catalogs/structure.json`` — which that file's own instructions invite whenever a counter
"legitimately shrank" — leaves the whole 31-test structural suite **GREEN** while the durable-write
tally sits at 0 and any raw write sails through. The same tree reds 2 of the 5 legs here, by name.
Without the regeneration the existing suite does catch it (stale-high + byte-match), so the hole
is narrow — and narrow is exactly how a gate dies quietly. A red alone is not evidence either:
this repo has measured a runner reporting identical failures WITH and WITHOUT a planted mutation.
Hence three legs, run through the SAME entry point:

* the clean tree must be GREEN (without this, the red below proves nothing);
* a planted RAW durable write must be RED, and the failure must NAME the planted site;
* a planted wrapper that DELEGATES to ``atomic_write`` must stay GREEN — otherwise leg two is
  satisfied by a gate that reds on any new file, which measures nothing about the helper.

The plant is spliced into the census WALK (``_src_py_files``), not into an inventory dict, so
every real layer runs: the walk, ``ast`` parse, the detector, the per-file census, the vacuity
checks and ``regressions_duplication``. ``scan()``'s memo key deliberately carries ``_parse``
and ``_src_py_files`` for exactly this reason, so patching the walk invalidates the cache
instead of serving a stale clean result. Nothing is written into ``src/`` and no real home is
touched: the planted module lives in ``tmp_path`` and only its *claimed* repo-relative name is
injected, via ``monkeypatch.setitem`` on the rel-path memo.
