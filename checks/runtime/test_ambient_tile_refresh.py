"""AMBIENT-SURFACES AS-2 — the chatless refresh, proved at the properties that can lie.

Four claims, each of which passes a naive test while being false:

1. **"Zero LLM calls."** Trivially true of a no-op. Proved at the SINK
   (`resolve_provider_for_use_case` raises) and paired with a VACUITY FLOOR: the same test
   asserts the refresh produced a changed, fully-interpolated body. A refresh that did
   nothing would satisfy "no model call" and fail the floor.
2. **"Deterministic."** A single run cannot see a stamped timestamp or a reordered key.
   Asserted as byte-identity across repeated renders, plus a re-render of a real refresh.
3. **"A ledger-only row carrying near-zero token cost + duration."** A refresh that wrote NO
   row also has no tokens — and is worse, because the tile then cannot tell the user what a
   refresh cost. So the row's existence AND its fields are asserted.
4. **"TTL mode."** A refresh that fires on every read and one that never fires both pass "it
   refreshed". Asserted at the boundary: refused just under the TTL, taken just over it.
