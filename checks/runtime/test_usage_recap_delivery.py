"""MRT-3 — the monthly usage recap's DELIVERY (the clause the fold shipped without).

`usage_recap(month)` renders and is pinned verbatim by `test_routing_usage.py`. This file covers
the other half of the clause: "delivers ONE digest-mode notification honoring quiet hours/mute via
the rules engine + system cron". Three properties, each of which is a GATE and therefore worthless
untested:

1. **Exactly one per month.** The mark is checked before rendering, so a monthly cron that fires
   twice (an overdue trigger re-armed by the boot sweep, a hand fire, a reconcile) emits once.
2. **Quiet hours / mute suppress it.** These live in `notification_allowed`, upstream of the rules
   engine, and a recap is `SEV_INFO` — so both must swallow it whole.
3. **The system cron exists and is ARMED.** A registered-but-unarmed trigger never runs; that is
   the exact S108 defect `digest_provider`'s tests were rewritten to catch.

Every delivery assertion here is paired with a VACUITY control: a suppression test that would pass
on a recap that never rendered proves nothing, so each one is run twice — once suppressed, once not
— against the same fold, and the unsuppressed leg must produce a real figure.
