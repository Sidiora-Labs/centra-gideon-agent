"""The bundled template library (Slice 9a, WF2 §6).

Six templates shipped inside the package. The tests here are mostly a **contract over the
library itself** rather than over code, because the failure modes are all of the "ships broken
and nobody notices until a user tries it" kind:

* a template that does not validate is a template that fails at every run start — and nothing
  else in the suite would parse these files;
* a template referencing an action provider that is not registered fails after a `stage` has
  already spent tokens;
* a template whose macro cannot expand is invisible in the listing, so a user sees five
  templates and no error;
* and the packaging: the JSON files must be declared as package data, or the WHEEL ships an
  empty library while the editable install looks perfect. That one is only observable from
  `pyproject.toml`, which is why it is asserted here.
