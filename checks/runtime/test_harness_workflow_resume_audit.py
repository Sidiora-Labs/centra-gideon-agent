"""Tests for the SV-6 workflow-run resume-audit — byte-equal frontier reconstruction.

The workflow half of the fresh-session resumability audit (§2.4, Success Criterion #5):
a persisted workflow run is KILLED and resumed from DISK ALONE, and the frontier the
resumed engine reconstructs must be byte-equal to the pre-kill snapshot. Independently, the
run's journal is folded through SV-5's event-fold law and checked against the persisted node
states, so a divergent replay (a corrupted or truncated journal) fails the audit even when
the state file alone looks intact.

These prove both halves of the "Done when":

1. resume-audit kills + resumes a persisted run from disk and verifies the journal replay
   reconstructs frontier state byte-equal to the pre-kill snapshot (the POSITIVE case,
   including a mid-flight kill while a node is still running);
2. a divergent replay — a corrupted journal / a dropped node event — FAILS the byte-equal
   check (the NEGATIVE case).
