"""Retroactive run/conversation → skill promotion (LEARN E1.3 — WF2LEA-11).

The clauses of the contract, each pinned against the REAL proposal queue, run store and
SkillsLoader (monkeypatched to a tmp home), not hand-built state:

1. a successful run — or a conversation — promotes to a `Kind.SKILL` proposal in the §2.2 queue,
   carrying the rationale a human reads before deciding;
2. the promotion writes NOTHING to the live skills tree, prompted or unprompted, and the proposing
   agent cannot accept its own row — the skill appears only through the human accept;
3. accepting installs exactly the one skill, so the path is not a queue that ends nowhere;
4. a REJECTED promotion re-attempted is SKIPped and adds no row (the queue's decision memory).
