"""The gateway boot path replays ``config.json`` ``providers[]`` into the model registry.

Provider entries are persisted by the create/update handlers, but nothing puts them
back into the process-wide ``ProviderRegistry`` on a fresh start. ``start_dashboard``
closes that gap with ONE synchronous ``sync_entries_from_config()`` immediately after
``load_all_extensions()``. Deleting that call left 257 selected tests green: the
FUNCTION had a rail (``test_registry_config_sync.py``), the WIRE had none — and a
module-level call is outside ``inert-surface-baseline.json``'s vocabulary (it censuses
declared surfaces: config keys, enum members, trigger kinds, editable-config entries,
SDK exports), so nothing else was ever going to notice.

What breaks without it, measured against this boot: with a provider in ``config.json``
and Settings → Models pinning one of its models, ``resolve_provider_for_use_case("chat")``
raises ``ERR_MODEL_UNRESOLVED`` — and the sentence the user reads says their provider is
"absent from config.json (its app isn't installed or configured)" and tells them to
install it from the App Store, while ``config.json`` plainly contains it. So a user
following the FIX text reinstalls or rebinds and stays stuck. That is why these rails
boot the real gateway and assert the EFFECT (the pinned model resolves), not that some
function was called.

The first rail is ordering-sensitive on purpose. It samples the registry from inside the
FIRST ``on_startup`` hook, so only the call in ``start_dashboard``'s synchronous body can
satisfy it: a replay moved to ``on_startup`` time would leave that sample empty. There
used to be a second, provably dead replay in the ``_model_providers_startup`` hook — the
body call is unguarded, so it either already registered everything or took the whole boot
down with it, leaving the hook copy nothing to do (measured: it returned 0 entries on a
real boot). It was deleted rather than railed.
