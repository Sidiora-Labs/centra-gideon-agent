"""Rails for the gateway boot block's two provider wires (``dashboard/server.py``).

Two module-level calls sit three lines apart in ``start_dashboard``'s synchronous body
and together stand the whole provider system up: ``load_all_extensions()`` (:1306)
discovers and enables every provider EXTENSION, and ``sync_entries_from_config()``
(:1317) replays the user's configured model entries on top of the types those
extensions just registered. Neither is reachable from a route test, so deleting either
left the route suite green while a real gateway booted with no providers at all. Both
are railed here by BOOTING THE REAL GATEWAY and asserting the effect at the call site,
never that a function was called.

The extension wire (``load_all_extensions``)
--------------------------------------------
Its observable consequence is a native provider extension being registered AND enabled
in the process-wide ``ProviderRegistry``, and its provider instance being live in the
per-type registry a caller actually resolves through. ``gideon-workflows`` is the
witness because the TOOL type is the one with no self-healing fallback: the only writer
into ``tool_providers.registry._providers`` in the whole tree is
``ProviderRegistry.ToolTypeHandler.register``, reachable only from this wire. The ACTION
types deliberately are NOT used — ``action_providers.registry._ensure_default_providers_
registered()`` re-registers ``bash``/``notify``/``create-task`` lazily on first execution,
so an action-shaped rail passes identically with the wire deleted. That is the exact trap
the absent-before floor exists to catch, and it is why the floor observes a registry the
fixture emptied rather than trusting a fresh process.

The config wire (``sync_entries_from_config``)
----------------------------------------------
Provider entries are persisted by the create/update handlers, but nothing puts them
back into the process-wide ``ProviderRegistry`` on a fresh start. ``start_dashboard``
closes that gap with ONE synchronous ``sync_entries_from_config()`` immediately after
``load_all_extensions()``. Deleting that call left 257 selected tests green: the
FUNCTION had a rail (``test_registry_config_sync.py``), the WIRE had none — and a
module-level call is outside ``inert-surface-baseline.json``'s vocabulary (it censuses
declared surfaces: config keys, enum members, trigger kinds, editable-config entries,
SDK exports), so nothing else was ever going to notice.

What breaks without it, measured against this boot: with a provider in ``config.json``
and Settings → Models pinning one of its models, ``resolve_provider_for_use_case("chat")``
raises ``ERR_MODEL_UNRESOLVED`` — and the sentence the user reads says their provider is
"absent from config.json (its app isn't installed or configured)" and tells them to
install it from the App Store, while ``config.json`` plainly contains it. So a user
following the FIX text reinstalls or rebinds and stays stuck. That is why these rails
boot the real gateway and assert the EFFECT (the pinned model resolves), not that some
function was called.

The config-wire rail is ordering-sensitive on purpose. It samples the registry from the
FIRST ``on_startup`` hook, so only the call in ``start_dashboard``'s synchronous body can
satisfy it: a replay moved to ``on_startup`` time would leave that sample empty. There
used to be a second, provably dead replay in the ``_model_providers_startup`` hook — the
body call is unguarded, so it either already registered everything or took the whole boot
down with it, leaving the hook copy nothing to do (measured: it returned 0 entries on a
real boot). It was deleted rather than railed.
