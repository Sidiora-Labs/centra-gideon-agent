"""Rendering-engine registry guards (R6 of rendering-engine-architecture.md).

The frontend ContentTypeRegistry (apps/console/src/ui/content/) is the ONE source of
truth for how a content type renders/edits/sanitizes. Two cross-tier invariants
keep it from forking again:

1. **Kind alignment** — every artifact `kind` the registry declares MUST be in the
   backend ``ALLOWED_KINDS`` and vice-versa. The registry is FE-authoritative
   (open-decision #2); this test is the "checked against it" half, so adding a kind
   on one tier without the other fails CI instead of silently 400-ing at save time.

2. **No parallel dispatch** — no web component outside ``ui/content/`` may
   re-introduce a content-type→renderer dispatcher (the ``IFRAME_KINDS`` /
   ``EDITABLE_KINDS`` Sets this plan deleted, or a raw ``dangerouslySetInnerHTML``
   on artifact/document content that bypasses the registry's sanitizer). These are
   the exact drifts the rendering engine consolidated; this guard stops their return.
