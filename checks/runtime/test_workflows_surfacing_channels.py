"""Tests for surfacing channels 2/3, scope resolution, preflight and the doctor (S59).

Three things were MEASURED before this module asserted anything about them.

**The `create-task` hook silently drops unknown keys.** Probed live: an action config carrying
`linked_def` and `workflow_binding` returned `success=True` and created a task whose
`workflow_binding` was `None` and whose persisted JSON held neither value. The plan's "materialized
tasks carry an explicit bidirectional link block" would therefore have been code that runs, reports
success, and enforces nothing — so the link lives in the cadence ledger and
`escalation_action` emits only keys the provider actually reads.

**`store.list_runs` is the only run history.** Verified signature
`list_runs(*, workflow_name, status, root_run_id, limit, offset) -> (list, total)` and that
`WorkflowRun` carries `completed_at`. A `last_completed` field cached on the def would disagree with
this table the first time a run was deleted.

**`WorkflowDef` has no `scope`, `cadence_days` or `fingerprint` field yet** (measured against
`dataclasses.fields`). So this session's records are standalone and the def-side wiring is the
later session's scope — asserting against a field that does not exist is how a test passes while
the feature is absent.
