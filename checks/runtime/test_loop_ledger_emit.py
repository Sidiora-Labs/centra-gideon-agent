"""PP-5 — loops emit the platform ledger, closing the flywheel's loop blind spot.

The acceptance bar is not "the rows exist": it is the flywheel producing a PROPOSAL from loop
evidence where before it saw nothing, the loop's trajectory being reconstructable FROM THE LEDGER
ALONE (the old findings/verdicts file store gone, not dual-written), and a supervisor assessment
landing as a `judge_verdict` in the reconciled `JudgeVerdict` vocabulary (WF2LOO-16), not a fifth
dialect.

Every test drives loop cycles through the REAL emit path — `store.record_cycle_findings`
(the worker's file → `step_started`/`step_completed`) and `store.write_verdict`
(→ `judge_verdict`) — under a tmp `GIDEON_HOME`, because the proposal/staging stores bind
`config_dir` lazily and the env var is what actually isolates the write path.
