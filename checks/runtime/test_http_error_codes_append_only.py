"""Append-only guard for the WIRE error-code registry (`gideon.http_errors`).

The peer of ``tests/test_error_codes_append_only.py``, which guards the *agent*
registry (``errors.ERROR_CODES``, ``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE``). This one guards the *wire*
registry (``http_errors.HTTP_ERROR_CODES``, ``lowercase_snake``).

**Why it exists.** `AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" → **Error envelope (HTTP)** has
always declared the wire ``code`` "append-only and never reworded once shipped" — a
stable surface an agent, a saved SOP, or a browser client branches on. But no
registry existed and no rail existed, so the declaration was unverifiable: a
*declared* stable surface that nothing could check. The registry and this suite are
that check.

The mechanism mirrors the agent-code rail exactly: a frozen baseline
(:data:`_RELEASED`) embedded here, deliberately a COPY rather than a subset of the
live dict — the copy is what detects an in-place reword. Adding a code = add a row
to ``HTTP_ERROR_CODES`` (baseline untouched → still a subset → still green).
Removing or rewording one = the baseline no longer matches → red, which is the
point.

**Vacuity.** Two of these tests read the *code*, not the registry: they walk every
``json_error`` call site and assert its code is registered. A matcher that silently
stops matching would find zero call sites and pass, so both are floored against the
population the census measured (``test_wire_error_envelope_census.EMITTER_SITE_FLOOR``).
A rail that inspects nothing must never read as clean.
