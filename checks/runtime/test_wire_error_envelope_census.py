"""The wire-error-envelope CENSUS: how many routes emit which of the two shapes.

`AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" → **Error envelope (HTTP)** declares ONE wire
shape — ``{"error": {"code": "<stable_snake_code>", "message": "<human>"}}``. The
codebase ships two. This module measures the population so the second shape is a
counted, shrinking number instead of an anecdote, and so a client's complaint ("I
cannot tell from a route which of the two I will get") has a size.

**Why a test and not a script.** A one-off count decays the day it is taken. As a
test the count is re-derived on every run and RATCHETED: the structured population
may only grow, the flat one may only shrink. That turns "we should unify these"
into a mechanism that cannot silently reverse.

**What the two shapes are.**

* *structured* — ``web.json_response({"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}})``,
  plus every call to :func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error`, which emits that
  shape by construction. A client can branch on the code.
* *flat* — ``web.json_response({"error": <anything else>})``: a bare prose string,
  an f-string, a variable. Carries NO code, so a client has nothing to branch on
  and is reduced to matching on prose that is free to be reworded.

**Scope.** Only the wire envelope. ``AgentError``'s ``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE`` envelope
(:mod:`gideon.errors`) is a DIFFERENT surface and is deliberately left
distinct; success envelopes are explicitly out of scope (the same convention says
they imitate the neighboring handler and are not standardized retroactively).

# ── The measured baseline (PL-8, re-measured 2026-08-21 on this tree) ──────────
#
# Re-measure with this suite, never by hand. The atom that introduced this census
# quoted 98 structured / 134 flat "measured at authoring"; neither number
# reproduces at call-site, per-function, or per-file granularity on this tree —
# the real call-site population was an order of magnitude larger on the flat side.
# These rows are what THIS scanner measures, and they are the baseline from here.

#: Direct ``json_response({"error": {"code": ...}})`` sites. A FLOOR (may only grow):
#: every one of these is a route a client can branch on, and losing one is a
#: regression. Falls only when a site is converted to :func:`json_error`, which is
#: counted separately below — so the SUM is the number that must never fall.
STRUCTURED_DIRECT_BASELINE = 118

#: Calls to the one emitter. A FLOOR. This is also the population the append-only
#: rail must inspect (see ``EMITTER_SITE_FLOOR``).
EMITTER_SITE_BASELINE = 132

#: Direct ``json_response({"error": "<prose>"})`` sites — the shape that carries no
#: code. A CEILING (may only shrink). Every one of these is a route where a client
#: must match prose. PL-8 removed the four helpers that manufactured them wholesale;
#: the remaining population is per-site work for later atoms.
FLAT_BASELINE = 1507

#: What the append-only rail must inspect. Derived from the census so a matcher that
#: stops matching cannot read as clean: if the rail's scan finds fewer emitter sites
#: than the census counted, the rail is measuring itself, not the code.
EMITTER_SITE_FLOOR = EMITTER_SITE_BASELINE

#: Vacuity floor for the scan itself. The tree has ~950 modules; a scan that walks
#: a handful has lost its root, and every count below would read as an improvement.
