"""The wire-error-envelope CENSUS: how many routes emit which of the two shapes.

`AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" → **Error envelope (HTTP)** declares ONE wire
shape — ``{"error": {"code": "<stable_snake_code>", "message": "<human>"}}``. The
codebase ships two. This module measures the population so the second shape is a
counted, shrinking number instead of an anecdote, and so a client's complaint ("I
cannot tell from a route which of the two I will get") has a size.

**Why a test and not a script.** A one-off count decays the day it is taken. As a
test the count is re-derived on every run and RATCHETED: the structured population
may only grow, the flat one may only shrink. That turns "we should unify these"
into a mechanism that cannot silently reverse.

**What the two shapes are.**

* *structured* — ``web.json_response({"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}})``,
  plus every call to :func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error`, which emits that
  shape by construction. A client can branch on the code.
* *flat* — ``web.json_response({"error": <anything else>})``: a bare prose string,
  an f-string, a variable. Carries NO code, so a client has nothing to branch on
  and is reduced to matching on prose that is free to be reworded.

**Wrapper indirection, and why this scanner follows it.** The first version of this
census classified the payload at the ``json_response`` *call site* only. That made it
blind by construction to a module that routes its responses through a local helper —
``def _json(payload, status): return web.json_response(payload, status=status)`` —
because at the ``json_response`` line the payload is a *variable*, not a literal, and
a non-literal was silently skipped. `inbound/bridge.py` shipped **eleven** flat
envelopes that this census scored at **zero**, and the companion rail
(:func:`test_no_module_local_error_helper_came_back`) missed them too because it
matches helper NAMES — ``_err``/``_error``/``_bad_request`` — and the helper was
called ``_json``. A name-matched denylist is not a control; renaming the helper
defeats it. `inbound/mcp_http.py` shipped **seven** more behind the same blindness,
two hops deep (``_done``, a closure, forwarding into module-level ``_json``); both
modules are converted now and the wrapper ceiling is 0.

So the scanner now does two things instead:

1. It **follows the value one hop through a wrapper.** Any module-local function that
   forwards one of its own parameters into ``json_response``'s payload slot (directly,
   or through another such wrapper) is recognised as a response wrapper, and calls to
   it are classified by the payload argument at *their* call site. That is what makes
   the bridge's eleven visible.
2. Where it **cannot** resolve the payload to a dict literal it *refuses to classify*
   and says so out loud: the site lands in :attr:`Census.unresolved`, which carries its
   own ceiling. A scanner that silently declines to classify is the same defect one
   level up, so the refusal is a counted, shrinking number — and a brand-new flat
   envelope can no longer hide behind indirection, because it must either resolve
   (counted flat) or not (counted unresolved). Both directions red.

**Scope.** Only the wire envelope. ``AgentError``'s ``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE`` envelope
(:mod:`gideon.errors`) is a DIFFERENT surface and is deliberately left
distinct; success envelopes are explicitly out of scope (the same convention says
they imitate the neighboring handler and are not standardized retroactively).

# ── The measured baseline (PL-8, re-measured 2026-08-21 on this tree) ──────────
#
# Re-measure with this suite, never by hand. The atom that introduced this census
# quoted 98 structured / 134 flat "measured at authoring"; neither number
# reproduces at call-site, per-function, or per-file granularity on this tree —
# the real call-site population was an order of magnitude larger on the flat side.
# These rows are what THIS scanner measures, and they are the baseline from here.

#: Direct ``json_response({"error": {"code": ...}})`` sites. A FLOOR (may only grow):
#: every one of these is a route a client can branch on, and losing one is a
#: regression. Falls only when a site is converted to :func:`json_error`, which is
#: counted separately below — so the SUM is the number that must never fall.
STRUCTURED_DIRECT_BASELINE = 118

#: Calls to the one emitter. A FLOOR. This is also the population the append-only
#: rail must inspect (see ``EMITTER_SITE_FLOOR``).
EMITTER_SITE_BASELINE = 132

#: Direct ``json_response({"error": "<prose>"})`` sites — the shape that carries no
#: code. A CEILING (may only shrink). Every one of these is a route where a client
#: must match prose. PL-8 removed the four helpers that manufactured them wholesale;
#: the remaining population is per-site work for later atoms.
#:
#: Deliberately still counts DIRECT sites only, so the number stays comparable with
#: every earlier measurement of it. The population the widened scanner newly sees is
#: counted separately below rather than folded in here — folding it in would have
#: required raising this ceiling, which is the one move a ratchet cannot survive.
#: 🔁 RATCHETED 1507 -> 1504 on 2026-08-28. `main` had drifted to 1508 — one over — and the four
#: offending sites were `handlers/apps.py`'s "JSON body must be an object" plus the three
#: `_reject_name` refusals in `handlers/files.py`. All four now emit `json_error`, so the
#: population fell to 1504 and the ceiling follows it down: shrink-only means a shrink is
#: LOCKED IN, not banked as slack a later flat envelope could spend.
#: 🔁 RATCHETED 1504 -> 1499 on 2026-08-28, applying that same rule to somebody else's shrink.
#: `b4bfdc5f6` ("give the hierarchy handler's malformed-body refusals a wire code") converted five
#: refusals in `tasks/hierarchy_handlers.py` and left this ceiling untouched, so the population sat
#: at 1499 against 1504. Five slack is not neutral: it is five future flat envelopes that can land
#: green, which is precisely the "banked, not locked in" state the line above argues against. That
#: file still carries 27 flat sites, so the next shrink there should ratchet this again.
FLAT_BASELINE = 1499

#: Flat sites reached through a WRAPPER (see the module docstring). A CEILING, measured
#: on this tree the moment the scanner could see them at all. The first measurement was
#: **18** — eleven in ``inbound/bridge.py`` and seven in ``inbound/mcp_http.py``. The
#: bridge's eleven were converted to :func:`~gideon.http_errors.json_error` in the
#: same change that widened the scanner (baseline 18 → 7); `mcp_http`'s seven, routed
#: through its ``_json``/``_done`` helpers, were converted in the follow-up atom the
#: 7 was left visible for. Hence **0**.
#:
#: Zero is the strongest form of this ceiling and the most fragile to read: ``0 <= 0``
#: also passes when the detector has stopped working. Three things stop that from being
#: indistinguishable from success —
#: :func:`test_the_wrapper_detector_still_fires_on_the_real_tree` (the tree still HAS
#: wrappers), :func:`test_a_renamed_helper_cannot_escape_the_wrapper_scan` (shape, not
#: name), and :func:`test_a_flat_envelope_planted_back_into_mcp_http_is_counted`, which
#: re-plants one of the converted envelopes into the real module's real source and
#: asserts this bucket counts it. Do not delete that last one to make this ceiling
#: cheaper; it is the only thing that makes the zero mean anything.
FLAT_VIA_WRAPPER_BASELINE = 0

#: The honest single number going forward: no client cares which spelling of
#: indirection carried the envelope that gave it no code to branch on.
FLAT_TOTAL_BASELINE = FLAT_BASELINE + FLAT_VIA_WRAPPER_BASELINE

#: ``json_response``/wrapper sites whose payload the scanner CANNOT resolve to a dict
#: literal — a variable, a call, a comprehension, an await. A CEILING, because this is
#: precisely the hole the bridge's eleven hid in: a site the scanner declines to
#: classify must not be a site it declines to *count*. Measured on this tree at 204
#: (mostly plain names and calls, with a tail of comprehensions/lists/awaits), 14 of
#: them reached through a wrapper. A wrapper's OWN forwarding line is excluded — it is
#: accounted for at the wrapper's call sites, so counting it would seed this ceiling
#: with rows nobody can ever fix.
#:
#: A new unresolvable site reds this, which is the point: a new flat envelope must now
#: either resolve (and hit a flat ceiling) or fail to resolve (and hit this one). There
#: is no third option any more.
#:
#: 204 → **202**: converting `mcp_http`'s refusals also retired two rows that were hiding
#: HERE rather than in the wrapper bucket — an admission refusal built by a ternary into a
#: local (``refusal``) and the rate-limit body built into a local (``payload``). Both were
#: flat envelopes; neither was visible as one, because the scanner correctly refuses to
#: read a variable's shape. A ceiling that falls when work lands is the ratchet working,
#: so it is lowered rather than left slack.
#:
#: 202 → **204** (ES-3): the retrieval ablation's two new reads on the evals surface,
#: ``json_response(view)`` and ``json_response(card)``. Both are 200 SUCCESS bodies built by a
#: view function, which is the same shape the three reads already on that surface use
#: (judge-bench, studies, ablation). Spelling their keys out at the call site would resolve
#: them, and was rejected: it duplicates the view's schema in two places, which is the drift
#: this repo keeps finding. The 2 is bought and then PINNED by
#: :func:`test_the_evals_surface_hides_no_flat_envelope_in_its_unresolved_rows`, so the slack
#: cannot be spent on a flat error envelope later — that is the hazard this ceiling exists for,
#: and every error on that surface goes through :func:`json_error` instead.
#:
#: 204 → **205** (LV-3): the learning summary's one new read on the learning surface,
#: ``json_response(compose_learning_summary(...).to_payload())``. Same shape as the ES-3 pair
#: above — a 200 SUCCESS body built by a composer — and spelling its keys out at the call site
#: was rejected for the same reason: it would duplicate ``LearningSummary``'s schema in two
#: places, which is the drift this repo keeps finding. The 1 is bought and then PINNED by
#: :func:`test_the_learning_surface_hides_no_flat_envelope_in_its_unresolved_rows`.
#:
#: 205 → **208** (EA-8): three 200-status SUCCESS bodies on the A2A gateway — the agent card
#: and the two A2A Task documents (``POST /a2a/tasks``, ``GET /a2a/tasks/{id}``). All three are
#: protocol documents whose shape is defined by the A2A spec and built by ``a2a.build_card`` /
#: ``a2a._task_envelope``; spelling their keys out at the call site would duplicate the wire
#: schema in two places, which is the drift this repo keeps finding. The 3 is bought and then
#: PINNED by :func:`test_the_a2a_surface_hides_no_flat_envelope_in_its_unresolved_rows`, which
#: takes the ES-3 pin's stronger shape: that module emits NO flat envelope at all.
#: 205 → **207** (LV-4): the identity report's two new 200 SUCCESS bodies on the same learning
#: surface — ``json_response(compose_identity_report(...).to_payload())`` and
#: ``json_response(delivery.to_payload())``. Identical shape and identical reasoning to the LV-3
#: row above (a composer's return value; spelling its keys out would duplicate
#: ``IdentityReport``/``IdentityReportDelivery``'s schema in two places). **The slack is not
#: spendable on an error envelope:** LV-4's four refusals go through :func:`json_error`, which
#: needs no payload dict at all, so the learning surface's FLAT count is unchanged at 14 and
#: :func:`test_the_learning_surfaces_new_unresolved_row_cannot_become_a_flat_envelope` pins it
#: there. Measured: the first draft used flat ``{"error": str}`` bodies and reds three of these
#: ratchets at once, which is how the structured envelope came to be used here.
#: **208 + 2 = 210 (union).** Both rows above were measured against the SAME base of 205 —
#: EA-8 bought +3 and LV-4 bought +2, independently — so NEITHER side's number is correct
#: for a tree carrying both, and taking either one would silently un-pin the other surface.
#: The ceiling is the sum, and the two per-surface FLAT pins above are what keep the slack
#: from being spent on an error envelope.
#: 210 → **211** (PEP-5): one 200-status SUCCESS body on the onboarding surface —
#: ``json_response(report.to_dict())`` in ``handlers/onboarding_import.py``. Same shape and
#: same reasoning as the LV-3/LV-4 rows above: it is a composer's return value, and spelling
#: its keys out at the call site would duplicate ``ImportReport``'s schema in two places —
#: exactly the drift this census exists to catch. **The slack is not spendable on an error
#: envelope:** the import route's refusals go through ``json_error``, which needs no payload
#: dict at all, so the onboarding surface's FLAT count is unchanged.
#: 211 → **212** (PEP-9): one 200-status SUCCESS body on the artifact-deploy route — the
#: ``{"ok": True, "deployment": …, "build": …}`` payload, whose members are the stores' own
#: ``to_dict()`` returns. Same reasoning as the LV-3/LV-4 rows above.
#: **The slack is not spendable on an error envelope:** this atom's two refusals were CONVERTED
#: to :func:`json_error` (``artifact_build_failed`` 422, ``artifact_slug_invalid`` 400) rather
#: than accommodated, so ``FLAT_BASELINE`` stayed at 1507 — it is shrink-only and was not raised.
#: **Measured against `origin/main`, not carried forward.** An earlier revision of this branch
#: recorded a net delta of ZERO, and that reading expired: it was taken before ES-7 landed a site
#: of its own. The delta a branch needs is main-RELATIVE, so it has to be re-measured at every
#: rebase rather than reused — main now measures 211 and this branch measures 212.
#: 212 → **213** (AS-6): one 200-status SUCCESS body on the tile-action route —
#: ``POST /api/dashboard/views/{view}/tiles/action`` answers with the record
#: ``tile_actions.check`` builds, whose ``violations`` member is a list of tuples the checker
#: owns. Spelling those out at the call site would duplicate the fence's own shape in two places.
#: **The slack is not spendable on an error envelope:** the route's refusals are part of that same
#: 200 record BY DESIGN — the fence reports what it refused so the caller can name the denied
#: provider — and no flat ``{"error": …}`` body was added, so ``FLAT_BASELINE`` stays 1507.
#: Measured against `origin/main` at rebase time: main 212, this branch 213. This row read
#: "211 → 212" one rebase ago; the step is MAIN-RELATIVE and moves whenever another atom lands
#: one of these, so it is re-measured at every rebase rather than carried forward.
#: 213 → **214** (AS-6, the L2 overlay producer): one 200-status SUCCESS body on the new
#: surface-overlay read route — ``GET /api/surfaces/overlays`` answers with
#: ``web.json_response(overlay_payload())`` in ``dashboard/handlers/surfaces.py``, and
#: ``surface_overlay.overlay_payload`` is the loader's own composer
#: (``{"overlays": [...to_dict()], "refusals": [...to_dict()], "dir": str}``). Spelling those
#: keys out at the call site would duplicate the overlay loader's wire schema in two places —
#: the drift this census exists to catch — and it would put the ``dir``/refusal shape in a
#: handler that "owns nothing but the JSON". **The slack is not spendable on an error
#: envelope:** this route has no flat refusal at all. Its refusals ride the SAME 200 record by
#: design (an overlay naming a component that does not exist is reported beside the surface it
#: belongs to, because a 4xx would be indistinguishable from a broken request), so no flat
#: ``{"error": …}`` body was added and ``FLAT_BASELINE`` stays 1507 — shrink-only, not raised.
#: The one added unresolved site is ``dashboard/handlers/surfaces.py:28``. AS-6 LANDED FIRST, so
#: this row's 213 → 214 step is now part of `origin/main`'s own measurement.
#: 213 → **214** (EA-5): one 200-status SUCCESS body on the capture import route —
#: ``POST /capture/import`` answers with ``web.json_response(report)`` in
#: ``inbound/capture_proxy.py``, where ``report`` is verbatim what
#: ``capture_import.import_capture_file`` returned (``-> dict[str, Any]``: the normalised
#: counts, the staged record ids and the per-line rejections). Spelling those keys out at the
#: call site would duplicate the importer's own report schema in two places — the drift this
#: census exists to catch — and would make the proxy the second author of a shape the importer
#: owns. **The slack is not spendable on an error envelope:** every refusal on this route
#: already goes through :func:`json_error` (``capture_import_failed`` 500 immediately above this
#: site, plus the admission refusals), which needs no payload dict at all, so no flat
#: ``{"error": …}`` body was added and ``FLAT_BASELINE`` stays 1507 — shrink-only, not raised.
#: The one added unresolved site is ``inbound/capture_proxy.py``'s import route.
#: **214 + 1 = 215 (union).** The two rows above were measured against the SAME base of 213 —
#: AS-6's overlay producer and EA-5's capture import each bought +1, independently — so NEITHER
#: side's 214 is correct for a tree carrying both, exactly as the 208 + 2 = 210 row above records.
#: AS-6 landed first, so `origin/main` now measures 214 and this branch measures 215; taking
#: either row's 214 would silently un-pin the other surface. Measured at rebase time, both with
#: ``files_scanned`` 1033 and the flat total identical at 1507 on both sides, so ``FLAT_BASELINE``
#: stays 1507 — shrink-only, not raised. MAIN-RELATIVE, so re-measure at the next rebase.

    refusal on the surface goes through :func:`~gideon.http_errors.json_error`. So a
    future flat error built into a local on this module would land in ``census.flat`` and red
    the flat ceiling rather than quietly occupying this slack.
