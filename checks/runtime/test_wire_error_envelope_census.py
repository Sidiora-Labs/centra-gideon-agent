"""The wire-error-envelope CENSUS: how many routes emit which of the two shapes.

`AGENTS.md` §"Shared conventions" → **Error envelope (HTTP)** declares ONE wire
shape — ``{"error": {"code": "<stable_snake_code>", "message": "<human>"}}``. The
codebase ships two. This module measures the population so the second shape is a
counted, shrinking number instead of an anecdote, and so a client's complaint ("I
cannot tell from a route which of the two I will get") has a size.

**Why a test and not a script.** A one-off count decays the day it is taken. As a
test the count is re-derived on every run and RATCHETED: the structured population
may only grow, the flat one may only shrink. That turns "we should unify these"
into a mechanism that cannot silently reverse.

**What the two shapes are.**

* *structured* — ``web.json_response({"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}})``,
  plus every call to :func:`gideon.http_errors.json_error`, which emits that
  shape by construction. A client can branch on the code.
* *flat* — ``web.json_response({"error": <anything else>})``: a bare prose string,
  an f-string, a variable. Carries NO code, so a client has nothing to branch on
  and is reduced to matching on prose that is free to be reworded.

**Wrapper indirection, and why this scanner follows it.** The first version of this
census classified the payload at the ``json_response`` *call site* only. That made it
blind by construction to a module that routes its responses through a local helper —
``def _json(payload, status): return web.json_response(payload, status=status)`` —
because at the ``json_response`` line the payload is a *variable*, not a literal, and
a non-literal was silently skipped. `inbound/bridge.py` shipped **eleven** flat
envelopes that this census scored at **zero**, and the companion rail
(:func:`test_no_module_local_error_helper_came_back`) missed them too because it
matches helper NAMES — ``_err``/``_error``/``_bad_request`` — and the helper was
called ``_json``. A name-matched denylist is not a control; renaming the helper
defeats it.

So the scanner now does two things instead:

1. It **follows the value one hop through a wrapper.** Any module-local function that
   forwards one of its own parameters into ``json_response``'s payload slot (directly,
   or through another such wrapper) is recognised as a response wrapper, and calls to
   it are classified by the payload argument at *their* call site. That is what makes
   the bridge's eleven visible.
2. Where it **cannot** resolve the payload to a dict literal it *refuses to classify*
   and says so out loud: the site lands in :attr:`Census.unresolved`, which carries its
   own ceiling. A scanner that silently declines to classify is the same defect one
   level up, so the refusal is a counted, shrinking number — and a brand-new flat
   envelope can no longer hide behind indirection, because it must either resolve
   (counted flat) or not (counted unresolved). Both directions red.

**Scope.** Only the wire envelope. ``AgentError``'s ``ERR_UPPER_SNAKE`` envelope
(:mod:`gideon.errors`) is a DIFFERENT surface and is deliberately left
distinct; success envelopes are explicitly out of scope (the same convention says
they imitate the neighboring handler and are not standardized retroactively).

# ── The measured baseline (PL-8, re-measured 2026-08-21 on this tree) ──────────
#
# Re-measure with this suite, never by hand. The atom that introduced this census
# quoted 98 structured / 134 flat "measured at authoring"; neither number
# reproduces at call-site, per-function, or per-file granularity on this tree —
# the real call-site population was an order of magnitude larger on the flat side.
# These rows are what THIS scanner measures, and they are the baseline from here.

#: Direct ``json_response({"error": {"code": ...}})`` sites. A FLOOR (may only grow):
#: every one of these is a route a client can branch on, and losing one is a
#: regression. Falls only when a site is converted to :func:`json_error`, which is
#: counted separately below — so the SUM is the number that must never fall.
STRUCTURED_DIRECT_BASELINE = 118

#: Calls to the one emitter. A FLOOR. This is also the population the append-only
#: rail must inspect (see ``EMITTER_SITE_FLOOR``).
EMITTER_SITE_BASELINE = 132

#: Direct ``json_response({"error": "<prose>"})`` sites — the shape that carries no
#: code. A CEILING (may only shrink). Every one of these is a route where a client
#: must match prose. PL-8 removed the four helpers that manufactured them wholesale;
#: the remaining population is per-site work for later atoms.
#:
#: Deliberately still counts DIRECT sites only, so the number stays comparable with
#: every earlier measurement of it. The population the widened scanner newly sees is
#: counted separately below rather than folded in here — folding it in would have
#: required raising this ceiling, which is the one move a ratchet cannot survive.
FLAT_BASELINE = 1507

#: Flat sites reached through a WRAPPER (see the module docstring). A CEILING, measured
#: on this tree the moment the scanner could see them at all. The first measurement was
#: **18** — eleven in ``inbound/bridge.py`` and seven in ``inbound/mcp_http.py``; the
#: bridge's eleven were converted to :func:`~gideon.http_errors.json_error` in the
#: same change that widened the scanner, which is why the baseline is 7 and not 18.
#:
#: The seven that remain are `mcp_http`'s HTTP-level refusals routed through its ``_json``
#: and ``_done`` helpers. They are per-site work for a later atom; what matters is that
#: they are now a counted, shrinking budget instead of invisible.
FLAT_VIA_WRAPPER_BASELINE = 7

#: The honest single number going forward: no client cares which spelling of
#: indirection carried the envelope that gave it no code to branch on.
FLAT_TOTAL_BASELINE = FLAT_BASELINE + FLAT_VIA_WRAPPER_BASELINE

#: ``json_response``/wrapper sites whose payload the scanner CANNOT resolve to a dict
#: literal — a variable, a call, a comprehension, an await. A CEILING, because this is
#: precisely the hole the bridge's eleven hid in: a site the scanner declines to
#: classify must not be a site it declines to *count*. Measured on this tree at 204
#: (mostly plain names and calls, with a tail of comprehensions/lists/awaits), 14 of
#: them reached through a wrapper. A wrapper's OWN forwarding line is excluded — it is
#: accounted for at the wrapper's call sites, so counting it would seed this ceiling
#: with rows nobody can ever fix.
#:
#: A new unresolvable site reds this, which is the point: a new flat envelope must now
#: either resolve (and hit a flat ceiling) or fail to resolve (and hit this one). There
#: is no third option any more.
UNRESOLVED_PAYLOAD_CEILING = 204

#: What the append-only rail must inspect. Derived from the census so a matcher that
#: stops matching cannot read as clean: if the rail's scan finds fewer emitter sites
#: than the census counted, the rail is measuring itself, not the code.
EMITTER_SITE_FLOOR = EMITTER_SITE_BASELINE

#: Vacuity floor for the scan itself. The tree has ~950 modules; a scan that walks
#: a handful has lost its root, and every count below would read as an improvement.
