"""Concurrent tool dispatch in the native loop (HC-6).

**No test here asserts a duration.** A threshold on wall-clock measures the machine, and a
fixed sleep measures the skeleton — so overlap is proved two ways that are exact instead:

* an :class:`asyncio.Barrier` that only completes if the calls really are in flight
  together. Serial dispatch cannot satisfy it, so the *negative control* is a real assertion
  and not a comment: the same turn under ``max_tool_concurrency=1`` must time out.
* an interval LOG of ``("start"|"end", key)`` pairs. "Two reads overlap" is
  "something else appears between one read's start and its end"; "a write serializes" is
  "nothing appears between the write's start and its end". Both are statements about order,
  which is what the atom actually promises.
