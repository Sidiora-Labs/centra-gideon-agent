"""`Lease`, `Dwell` and `MetricGate` — the capabilities `PP-12` adds to the admission seam.

Three claims are worth more than the rest, so they are asserted three different ways:

* **Additive.** A spec declaring none of the new keys must decide exactly what it decided before.
  Proven at three levels: `PP-11`'s golden frontier file re-runs byte-identically (unchanged, in
  `test_workflows_frontier_golden.py`), `compose()` returns identical lane/container verdicts under
  the three-policy and the six-policy list here, and a real run whose spec declares nothing never
  even builds an `AdmissionState` — asserted by making that construction throw.
* **Not a second lease.** `S57` measured an `unlink`-based single-use claim failing 36 of 40 races,
  so the atom forbids a second implementation. The decision here IS `pool.acquire` (railed by an AST
  scan, because "we reuse it" is a claim a passing test cannot settle) and the write IS
  `pool.claim_task`'s flocked compare-and-swap — driven from 16 threads contending for one resource,
  which is the shape that actually distinguishes a CAS from a check-then-act.
* **A lease survives a restart.** The record lives on disk, so the proof rebuilds the controller
  from persisted state — a fresh object with an empty memory — and asserts the holder is unchanged
  and the other items are still refused.

Purity note: every unit test below hands the policies a `now`. That is the whole design — a policy
that read a clock would be untestable at a boundary and unreplayable in a run.
