"""Tests for SOP surfacing discipline (TASKS-SOPS §2 R3/R4, S58).

The governing precedent is somebody else's scar tissue, quoted in the plan: OpenSquilla shipped
auto-trigger-by-default and retreated to manual-first after pasted content kept firing workflows. So
the tests here are mostly about NOT firing, and the pasted-content case is tested directly.

Two things were checked against real code rather than assumed:

**The negative-trigger veto matches `skills/surfacing._keyword_score` exactly** on the same inputs.
One veto syntax across both surfaces means a user who learned `!` once knows it everywhere; two
implementations would leave one surface silently ignoring the other's vetoes.

**`SCOPE_LADDER` already exists** in S45's `template_pipeline`, so scope words are
reused rather than redefined — two ladders would disagree about promotion order.
