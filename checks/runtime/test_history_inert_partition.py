"""§1.3's archive split: the runs inbox is for what the machine DID (S132).

§1.3 on `INERT_OUTCOMES`: *"These collapse to ledger rows and archive out of the default inbox
view —
the runs inbox is for what the machine DID."*

🔴 THE DEFECT. `INERT_OUTCOMES` was declared in `models.py` and read by **nothing** — the sixth
declared-but-unread table found in this stretch. Measured: `feed_response` returned every row
undifferentiated, so a minutely trigger held by quiet hours buries the one fire that mattered under
1439 `skipped_gate` rows, and the feed a user opens to answer *"what did my machine do"* answers
*"mostly nothing, 1440 times"*.

**A PARTITION, not a filter.** The suppressed rows are the answer to "why did my automation not
run",
so dropping them would replace one bad default with a worse one — §7 criterion 8 bans silent
drops, and
a row filtered out of the only surface that shows it is a silent drop with extra steps. `runs` still
carries every row; two id lists let a default view show work and fold the rest away.
