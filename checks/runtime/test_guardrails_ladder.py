"""The ladder as a USER drives it (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §6.1, atom AG-8).

The four things this atom promised, each asserted end to end rather than against a
constructed object:

1. **Promotion never happens without a click.** The proposal scan runs, files its row, and
   changes no rung; the only thing in the tree that calls ``grant_rung`` is the HTTP
   handler, asserted from the SOURCE so a future caller cannot slip in quietly.
2. **An undo click both reverses the action AND demotes the type.** Driven through a REAL
   event-trigger fire that creates a REAL task row, then undone through the REAL endpoint —
   the task file is gone afterwards and the type is back at its floor with a cooldown.
3. **The chip answers "why is this allowed to run by itself?"** — the ``authority`` sentence
   the chip renders, for all three provenances (declared floor, your grant, incident hold).
4. Fail-closed behaviour for every refusal the undo executor can reach, and for a grant
   above the ceiling or during a cooldown.

The withhold → grant → execute → undo round trip runs against ``execute_event_action``, the
same dispatch AG-7 wired, so nothing here proves a code path a user cannot reach.
