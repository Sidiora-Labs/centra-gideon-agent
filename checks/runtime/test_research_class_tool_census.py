"""Every tool Gideon ships is classified as a write or a read, and the read list is pinned.

`is_write_tool` decides whether a research-class leaf or an unattended research SUBAGENT may
call a tool. It was a substring match over CRUD verb fragments, and the comment above it
claimed "a newly-added write tool is denied by default" — which is what an allowlist of READS
would give you. A denylist of verb fragments gives the opposite: a tool whose name contains
none of them is allowed.

Measured across the seven shipped registries before the fix: **59 of 70 tools classified as
non-writes**. The learning store #1775 reports is the visible part; the rest included
`hook_register` (creates an external webhook ingress), `set_recurring_task` (creates a cron
that fires unattended), `loop_nudge_stop`, `notify`, `notify_attachment`, `artifact_save`,
`automation_run` and every `workflow_*` run-control verb. `subagent_run` and `best_of_n` were
in neither list, so a read-only spawn could fan out.

**Why this file is a census and not a list of examples.** The defect was not a wrong verdict on
a tool someone thought about; it was a whole surface nobody enumerated. So the rail enumerates
the live registries and pins the READ-ONLY set. Adding a tool to any registry without
classifying it fails here, and the failure names the tool — which is the only mechanism that
makes "denied by default" true for the tools we ship.

The classification of each write was taken from the tool's own registry DESCRIPTION, not from
its name, and that mattered in both directions: `refiner_evidence` says "Read-only: this is the
ONLY evidence…" and `suggest_template` says "it never saves anything", so two names that read
like writers are not; while `notify`, `hook_register` and `loop_nudge_stop` carry no CRUD verb
at all.
