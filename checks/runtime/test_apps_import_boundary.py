"""Import-lint: an installed APP may only reach into core through ``gideon.sdk.*``.

The core/app boundary (workspace-core-app-split §3) is a PUBLISHED SDK: apps import the
stable ``gideon.sdk`` facade, never deep core internals (``gideon.interfaces.dashboard``,
``gideon.engine.agents.native``, ``gideon.integrations.tool_providers.projection``, …). This test
statically scans every ``apps/<name>/*.py`` and fails on any ``import gideon.X`` /
``from gideon.X import`` where ``X`` is not ``sdk`` (or ``sdk.*``).

Rationale: if an app reaches past the SDK, core can't evolve its internals without
breaking installed apps — the whole point of the separation. When a genuinely-needed
symbol isn't on the SDK yet, the fix is to PROMOTE it to a ``gideon.sdk`` submodule
(as the model/media/tool/acp waves did), not to reach around the boundary.

Test files (``test_*.py``) are exempt: they legitimately import core test helpers +
patch core module paths (they run in the dev tree, not as an installed app).

    🔴 THIS RAIL HAD NEVER RUN, ANYWHERE. It resolved its target as
    ``Path(__file__).parents[3] / "apps"`` and module-skipped when that was absent — and it was
    always absent (issue 1777):

    * ``parents[2]`` is the parent of the *checkout*, not of the workspace, so from a git
      worktree at ``/private/tmp/<wt>`` it looked for ``/private/tmp/apps``. Measured.
    * From the main checkout it looked one level above the workspace root.
    * This workspace's apps clone is named ``GideonApps``, not ``apps`` — the gateway
      needs ``GIDEON_FIRST_PARTY_APPS_DIR`` for exactly that reason.
    * A CI clone has no sibling apps checkout at all.

    So the one lint enforcing the provider-agnostic-core tenet ("apps import core only via
    ``gideon.sdk.*``") was reported as skipped on every run, and a violation could have
    landed at any time without anything objecting. There is no second copy of this lint in the
    apps repo — checked — so this was the whole enforcement.

    Roots, in order: the env var the gateway already honours, the two sibling spellings relative
    to the REPO ROOT (not the checkout's parent), and the bundled apps. Duplicates collapse, so a
    workspace where two of these point at one tree is scanned once.
