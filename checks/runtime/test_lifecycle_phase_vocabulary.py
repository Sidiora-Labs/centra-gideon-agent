"""`PP-16` "one status vocabulary": terminality is DERIVED from one shared lifecycle phase.

`LoopStatus` and `RunStatus` disagreed about the terminality of the SAME word — `failed` refused
any further transition on a run while a failed loop is a `resume` source — because "has it
stopped producing" and "may it still transition" were one frozenset each, maintained beside each
enum by hand. `LifecyclePhase` declares the first once for both nouns; each noun declares which
of its ended states remain resumable; terminality is the difference.

These rails exist so the asymmetry cannot be quietly tidied away. The one that matters most is
`test_a_failed_loop_can_still_resume`: it drives the real store, so moving `FAILED` out of
`RESUMABLE_ENDED_STATUSES` withdraws resumability from every failed loop and turns red here
rather than in a user's stalled campaign.
