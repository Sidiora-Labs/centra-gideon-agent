"""S74 — ad-hoc work → templates (§3.2) and failed stages → typed lessons (§3.3).

Two spokes, one discipline: a DETERMINISTIC chain decides and a model is consulted only at the score
boundary. §3.2 replaced "pure LLM-prompt branches" for a reason — a model asked "is this
template-worthy" costs a call per candidate and answers differently daily.

**Measured before writing.** `is_environment_failure_claim` — §3.3's deny-filter, the guardrail
keeping a flaky network from becoming a durable lesson — caught **1 of 4** real environment
failures: "connection refused", `ECONNRESET`, and rate-limit noise all passed through, and §3.3
routes EVERY `step_failed` through it. Widened here to 12/12 with 0 false positives on real lessons;
`test_the_widened_env_filter_catches_real_transport_failures` and
`test_the_env_filter_does_not_eat_real_lessons` are the two halves of that regression.
