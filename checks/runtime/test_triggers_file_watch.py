"""The `file` trigger kind's runtime (AUTO §7 criterion 2 — S83).

Criterion 2: "*When a file in ~/notes changes, summarize it into my knowledge base*" is creatable in
chat in one message.

**Measured before writing.** The `file` kind is fully DECLARED — in `models.KINDS`, spec keys
`{paths, dedup}`, and a `file` trigger parses and stays `enabled=True` — and nothing watched a
filesystem for it. All nine `schedule_*` chat tools are clock-only, and the trigger handler had zero
references to the kind. A user could author one and it would never fire.

Every test here drives a REAL directory. A mocked filesystem cannot show the defect this module
exists
to prevent (an identical rewrite re-firing), because that defect is about `mtime` moving while
the content does not.
