"""The Slots block budget: `memory.slot_size_cap`'s four-point wiring + its clamp (MGAV-9).

MGAV-8 shipped slots with the block ceiling as a code constant. MGAV-9's `done_when` requires
"slot caps" reachable from the settings tab through the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist, so
the number became a config field — which means it now has to survive the round trip AND stay
inside a range config alone cannot leave. Both properties are asserted here because either one
alone is a hole: a field that round-trips but is unbounded is an unbounded always-injected
block, and a clamp nobody reads is decoration.
