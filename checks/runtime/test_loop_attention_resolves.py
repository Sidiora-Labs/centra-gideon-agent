"""A loop that stops waiting on the user closes its inbox row (issue 335).

The watchdog raises a durable "Loop blocked — needs you" row for a waiting loop. Nothing ever
closed it. Measured on `origin/main` by executing the real paths:

    emit_attention_item(..., refs={"loop": L}, dedup_key=f"loop:{L}:blocked")
        -> 1 PENDING row, 1 notification
    attention.resolve_gate_item(state, L)      -> closed 0     (it matches refs["workflow"])
    re-emit, same key                          -> the SAME row, and NO second notification

So both halves of the reported failure reproduce, and they compound: a standing demand the user
cannot clear by resolving its cause, plus a real later block that is never delivered — because
`emit_attention_item` returns an open row untouched and fires nothing, and the loop key
`loop:<id>:<event>` is permanent per (loop, event) rather than occurrence-scoped like the
workflow key.

Note the third measurement above: the resolver the issue suggested reusing **cannot** close a
loop row. `resolve_gate_item` hard-coded `refs["workflow"]`, so the mechanism existed but was
reachable only for workflows — which is why `workflows/attention.py`'s own docstring can say
"the same seam the loop watchdog uses" and still leave the loop with no resolver.

The fix puts the resolve where the emit already lives (`inbox.resolve_attention_items`, matching
on a ref subset so each caller supplies its own vocabulary), and fires it from the one place that
knows what status a loop is coming FROM — `loop.store.update_status`, on the ATTENTION →
non-ATTENTION transition, derived from `LOOP_PHASES` so a new attention status inherits it.

ARCC was queried first (user-facing notification records). It returned no local-store guidance —
its notification material is AWS infrastructure (SNS/CloudWatch/EventBridge). Two of its SAX-08
outcome-2 pitfalls do name this defect's mechanism and are applied: *alert fatigue from warnings
the user cannot action*, and *failing to deliver an alert channel's later occurrences*.
