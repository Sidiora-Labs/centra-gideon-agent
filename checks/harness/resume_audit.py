"""Fresh-session resumability audit (§2.4) — loop scope.

The harness-course "Fresh Session Test", mechanized for Gideon loops: after the
in-memory worker/planner session is gone (a crash/restart), can the resumed entity answer
*what's done / what's verified / what's next / how to verify* **from persisted state
alone**? This module reads a loop's on-disk state through ``gideon.loop.store`` (the
harness may import core; core may not import the harness) and reports whether each question
is answerable — the exact audit that would have caught the historical dead-resume bugs.

Loop mapping of the four questions (findings COUNT is the cycle clock — the plan's note
that in-memory watchdog counters are documented as non-resumed):

- **done?**    — ``loop.status`` (a terminal/attention status is a definitive answer).
- **verified?**— judge verdicts on disk (``store.get_verdicts``) and/or cycle findings.
- **next?**    — for phased kinds, ``plan`` + ``phase_status`` name the next stage; for
  open-ended goals, the marginal-score trail + status; otherwise the next cycle.
- **how to verify?** — the persisted task/spec text (``loop.task``) + the plan.

Workflow-run resume (the WF2 event-fold byte-equal frontier reconstruction) is DEFERRED —
it needs the Workflows-v2 engine + journal, which don't exist yet (see the plan's S4
BLOCKED note). This module covers the loop half, which is fully persistable today.
