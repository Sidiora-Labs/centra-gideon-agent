"""Fresh-session resumability audit (§2.4) — loop scope + workflow-run scope.

The harness-course "Fresh Session Test", mechanized for Gideon: after the in-memory
worker/planner/engine session is gone (a crash/restart), can the resumed entity answer
*what's done / what's verified / what's next / how to verify* **from persisted state
alone**? These functions read on-disk state only (the harness may import core; core may not
import the harness) — the exact audit that would have caught the historical dead-resume
bugs. Two entities, two halves:

- **Loops** (:func:`audit_loop`) — read a loop's SQLite row + file dir through
  ``gideon.loop.store`` and report per-question answerability. Findings COUNT is the
  cycle clock (in-memory watchdog counters are documented as non-resumed):

  - **done?**    — ``loop.status`` (a terminal/attention status is a definitive answer).
  - **verified?**— judge verdicts on disk (``files.get_verdicts``) and/or cycle findings.
  - **next?**    — for phased kinds, ``plan`` + ``phase_status`` name the next stage; for
    open-ended goals, the marginal-score trail + status; otherwise the next cycle.
  - **how to verify?** — the persisted task/spec text (``loop.task``) + the plan.

- **Workflow runs** (:func:`audit_workflow_run`) — the WF2 event-fold byte-equal frontier
  reconstruction. A persisted run is KILLED, resumed from DISK ALONE via a fresh
  ``RunController`` (no in-memory carryover — the whole point of the audit), and the
  frontier the resumed controller derives is asserted BYTE-EQUAL to the pre-kill snapshot,
  cross-checked against the journal event-fold (SV-5's ``fold_workflow``). This is the WF2
  event-fold law tested destructively: a resume that reconstructs a DIFFERENT frontier —
  or a journal whose fold no longer matches the persisted node states — is the dead-resume
  bug class this audit exists to catch.
