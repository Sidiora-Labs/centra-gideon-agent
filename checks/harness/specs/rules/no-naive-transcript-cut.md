# Never cut a transcript between a tool call and its result

When trimming a transcript or journal to fit a context window, a naive
"keep the last N messages" slice can land **between** a `tool_use` and its matching
`tool_result`. That leaves a dangling tool call (or orphan result), and the next provider
request is malformed — most model APIs reject an unpaired tool block outright.

## What compliance looks like

Truncation sites must use the shared walk-back helper that, after choosing a cut point,
moves the boundary so no tool-call/tool-result pair is split — the same pairing invariant
the workflow-rewind path adopts. If you're adding a new place that truncates conversation
history, route it through that helper rather than slicing the list directly.

The scanner check `no-naive-transcript-cut` flags a new slice of a
messages/transcript/journal list in the compaction modules that doesn't reference the
walk-back helper.
