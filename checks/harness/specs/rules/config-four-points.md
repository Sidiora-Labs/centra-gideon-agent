  A new field on a config dataclass with `_meta` must be wired through all four points:

  The silent-drop gotcha: a field present in a dataclass but omitted from `to_dict()` is

  Never expires while config is a hand-mapped dataclass. Retire only if load()/to_dict()

# Config fields are four-point contracts

Gideon's config is a set of dataclasses (`config/loader.py`), each field carrying a
`_meta(label, help)` for the settings UI. There is **no reflection** — `AppConfig.load()`
maps JSON to fields *explicitly*, field by field, and `to_dict()` serializes each section.
Miss either half and the field silently misbehaves:

- In the dataclass but **not** in `to_dict()` → the value is dropped every time config is
  saved (the user's setting vanishes on the next write).
- In `to_dict()` but **not** in `load()`'s mapping → the value reverts to its default on
  every reload (the user sets it, it "sticks" until restart, then resets).

## What compliance looks like

For a new field `foo` on `LegibilityConfig` (the worked example the codebase already ships):

1. **Dataclass + `_meta`:** `foo: bool = field(default=True, metadata=_meta("Foo", "…"))`
   on the dataclass in `config/loader.py`.
2. **`load()` mapping:** `AppConfig.load()` reads it explicitly —
   `legibility=LegibilityConfig(foo=bool(legibility_data.get("foo", True)), …)`.
3. **`to_dict()`:** the section is serialized (`"legibility": asdict(self.legibility)`).
4. **`_EDITABLE_CONFIG`** (`dashboard/handlers/core.py`), **only if runtime-editable via
   PATCH:** add the dotted path with its validation spec —
   `"legibility.foo": {"type": "bool"}` — plus a frontend control if user-facing.

`checks/runtime/test_config_roundtrip.py` mutates every leaf field and asserts save→load preserves
it, so it catches points 1–3. Point 4 (editability) is a deliberate choice per field —
the scanner check flags a field that looks editable but is missing from the allowlist.
