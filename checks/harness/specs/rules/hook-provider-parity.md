# Action providers must be in the hook allowlist

Two structures must agree: the action-provider **registry**
(`action_providers/registry.py` — `register_action_provider`, `list_action_providers`)
and the **validation allowlist** `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (a `frozenset` in
`validation.py`, consumed by `HOOK_CREATE_SCHEMA`/`HOOK_UPDATE_SCHEMA`). The allowlist is
hand-maintained; the registry is where providers actually register.

## What compliance looks like

When you add a new action provider, add its name to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` in the same
change. The proof is `test_hook_provider_allowlist_includes_all_action_providers`
(`checks/runtime/test_native_hook_providers.py`), which asserts
`set(list_action_providers()) - set(ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS)` is empty.

**Note (premise correction, 2026-07-26):** this invariant is *not* checked by
`checks/runtime/test_action_schema_executor_parity.py` — that test guards a different invariant
(an executor's `action_config` reads ⊆ its `app.json` `settingsSchema`). Cite the
`test_native_hook_providers.py` node-id above, not the parity test.
