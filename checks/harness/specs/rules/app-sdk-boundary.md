# Apps import core only through the SDK facade

The single most load-bearing boundary in the codebase: first-party and third-party app
bundles under `apps/` may reach core **only** through `gideon.sdk.*`
(`sdk.net`, `sdk.security`, and the other facade modules). A deep import like
`from gideon.loop.worktree import …` couples the app to a private internal that is
free to move — exactly what the boundary exists to prevent.

## What compliance looks like

Inside an app: `from gideon.sdk import net, security` (or the specific facade
symbol). If the SDK doesn't expose what the app needs, that is a gap to fill in the SDK
(a deliberate, reviewed addition) — never a reason to reach past it.

The deliberate in-core exceptions (things that legitimately live in core despite looking
vendor-ish) are enumerated in `docs/architecture/provider-boundary.md`; do not add to
them. `checks/runtime/test_apps_import_boundary.py` enforces this per app file; the scanner check
`app-sdk-boundary` promotes it to a diff-time check so a bad import is caught before the
test run.
