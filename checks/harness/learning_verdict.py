"""The skills-on/off verdict — `fanout_measure`'s posture, one arm vocabulary wider.

`harness/fanout_measure.py` owns the statistical posture this repo verdicts paired arms
with: the 5-point inconclusive band, the 5% token-match tolerance, the 3-trial floor, and
the rule that within-arm spread beats the delta. The learning benchmark
(`docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` §5) is prescribed against exactly
those constants — and cannot use that module's entry points, because `load_observations`
requires arms literally named `fanout` and `single` and refuses anything else. Measured:
`harness fanout-measure` on arms named `skills_on`/`skills_off` exits 2.

§5 states the two honest options and rules out the third. Generalising the arm vocabulary
inside `fanout_measure` is an owner call (the names are deliberately fixed there), and
relabelling `skills_on` as `fanout` to get a green run would be a lie in the output file.
So this is the sanctioned second option: **a thin sibling that imports the same constants**
— and, more than that, calls the same `compare()`. Nothing here re-derives a threshold, a
check order, or an aggregate:

* `Trial`, `Arm` and `compare()` are imported and used as-is. `compare()` is pure and its
  logic never reads an arm's *name*, only its trials — the names bind in `load_observations`,
  which this module does not use.
* the only thing added is a **directional relabel** of the two winner verdicts, so an output
  file about skills does not say `fanout_wins`. The closed set stays the same size: three of
  the five verdicts pass through byte-identical.
* the one thing this module *declares* rather than inherits is the token gate's DENOMINATOR
  (`SPEND_BASIS`). It is not a threshold and not a check order — it is which spend the gate
  divides, and it has no design-free answer: the fan-out design matches budget by giving the
  cheaper arm more samples, so its arms' trial counts are unequal on purpose and TOTALS are
  right there. This is a paired design (§3: `k` trials per arm on identical work), so its
  totals are commensurable only while the counts match, and §6's absent cells are exactly
  what makes them not.

Why this lives in `harness/` and not under `src/gideon/`: `harness` is a repo-root dev
package that is deliberately NOT in the shipped wheel (`harness/README.md`), so a module under
`src/` importing it would strand an import at install time — and `mypy`'s
`ignore_missing_imports` would not catch it. The consequence is a design rule with teeth: the
verdict is computed HERE, by the runner, and **written into the report artifact**. The gateway
and the dashboard only ever *read* a verdict string. A surface that cannot recompute a verdict
cannot invent one, which is why a report with no verdict renders as "not measured" rather than
as a zero.

VERDICT_SKILLS_ON_WINS = "skills_on_wins"

#: The ONE word this repo uses for "this fact was never recorded", spelled here to match
#: `src/gideon/evals/provenance.py` and `web/src/lib/unrecorded.ts`. Not IMPORTED from there:
#: `harness` is a repo-root dev package outside the wheel and this module's whole point is that the
#: dependency runs one way. `tests/test_evals_unrecorded_vocabulary.py` reds on a second spelling.
UNRECORDED = "unrecorded"

#: The SIXTH verdict, and the one member of this vocabulary that `fanout_measure` has no
#: counterpart for — which is why the relabel map below cannot produce it.
#:
#: §5 offers a direction only when the two arms were spend-matched. When a contributing cell's
#: provider did not report its usage (#2540) the token gate has no denominator to divide, so no
#: direction may be offered — and none of the five existing verdicts can say that honestly:
#:
#: * `not_token_matched` asserts a comparison HAPPENED and came out unmatched. Here none happened.
#:   Widening it would make "the arms differ by 40%" and "we cannot tell" the same published
#:   string, and the second is the one a reader must not read as the first.
#: * a `verdict` of `None` means the arms could not be ASSEMBLED (no cell scored). Here they were:
#:   the scores are real and are published beside this verdict. Collapsing them would hide a
#:   measured score delta behind "not measured".
#:
#: So this is a new word rather than a widened one — the same call #2630 made about `priced`.
VERDICT_TOKENS_UNRECORDED = f"tokens_{UNRECORDED}"

#: The denominator the token gate divides for THIS design, and the only knob this module declares.
#: §3 runs `k` trials per arm on identical work, so per-trial and total spend are the same
#: comparison whenever the run is whole — they diverge in exactly one case, and it is §6's: an arm
#: that lost cells to `VERIFIER_ABSENT`. Over unequal counts a totals ratio is not a spend
#: comparison at all; it reports the missing attempts. MEASURED (`learnbench-20260907T003211Z`):
#: `sk_task_project` lost two `skills_on` cells, was verdicted on 3 trials against 5, and published
#: `token_ratio` 0.5139 as "a 48.6% spend difference" where the per-trial value is 0.8565, 14.3%.
#: Recomputing both runs of #2587 on this basis changes no verdict CLASS — it corrects a published
#: number, which is why it is a miscomputation fix and not a protocol edit.

    Raised rather than noted, and raised even though the line above it passes :data:`SPEND_BASIS`

    belongs to), so an edit that drops the argument, or that flips :data:`SPEND_BASIS`, would
    silently restore the totals comparison and publish an "N% spend difference" that is mostly
    missing trials. §8 publishes the ratio beside the verdict, so a wrong ratio is read as evidence
    — a crash the tests catch beats a number a reader believes.

    Two bases are unusable, and this covers both. The second (#2540) is an UNRECORDED token count:
    `Trial.tokens` is an `int`, so a cell whose provider omitted its `usage` block arrives carrying
    a placeholder `0`, and a gate that divides it reports a spend match it never measured.
