"""The skills-on/off verdict — `fanout_measure`'s posture, one arm vocabulary wider.

`harness/fanout_measure.py` owns the statistical posture this repo verdicts paired arms
with: the 5-point inconclusive band, the 5% token-match tolerance, the 3-trial floor, and
the rule that within-arm spread beats the delta. The learning benchmark
(`docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` §5) is prescribed against exactly
those constants — and cannot use that module's entry points, because `load_observations`
requires arms literally named `fanout` and `single` and refuses anything else. Measured:
`harness fanout-measure` on arms named `skills_on`/`skills_off` exits 2.

§5 states the two honest options and rules out the third. Generalising the arm vocabulary
inside `fanout_measure` is an owner call (the names are deliberately fixed there), and
relabelling `skills_on` as `fanout` to get a green run would be a lie in the output file.
So this is the sanctioned second option: **a thin sibling that imports the same constants**
— and, more than that, calls the same `compare()`. Nothing here re-derives a threshold, a
check order, or an aggregate:

* `Trial`, `Arm` and `compare()` are imported and used as-is. `compare()` is pure and its
  logic never reads an arm's *name*, only its trials — the names bind in `load_observations`,
  which this module does not use.
* the only thing added is a **directional relabel** of the two winner verdicts, so an output
  file about skills does not say `fanout_wins`. The closed set stays the same size: three of
  the five verdicts pass through byte-identical.

Why this lives in `harness/` and not under `src/gideon/`: `harness` is a repo-root dev
package that is deliberately NOT in the shipped wheel (`harness/README.md`), so a module under
`src/` importing it would strand an import at install time — and `mypy`'s
`ignore_missing_imports` would not catch it. The consequence is a design rule with teeth: the
verdict is computed HERE, by the runner, and **written into the report artifact**. The gateway
and the dashboard only ever *read* a verdict string. A surface that cannot recompute a verdict
cannot invent one, which is why a report with no verdict renders as "not measured" rather than
as a zero.
