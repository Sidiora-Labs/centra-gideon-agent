"""Worktree fan-out hydration benchmark + the §1.1 measure-first gate (HARNESS-CRAFT HC-1).

HARNESS-CRAFT §1 is a **measured-bottleneck plan**: its sparse/pooled/reused hydration work
(§1.2, atom `HC-2`) is only allowed to be built if a fan-out actually pays for full working-tree
hydration. §1.1 states the gate in one sentence — *"if measurement shows <2s per worktree on the
benchmark, Session 1's remaining items are SKIPPED and the plan is re-scoped"* — and this module is
that sentence, executable.

Three decisions here are structural rather than incidental:

* **The benchmark reads the SHIPPED log line; it does not keep its own stopwatch.** Durations come
  from parsing `gideon.loop.worktree`'s timing line, so the number in this report is the
  number production emits. A parallel timer in the harness would be a second implementation of the
  measurement, free to disagree with the one that ships — and the disagreement would surface as a
  mystery months later. It also gives the log-line contract a real reader: change its fields and
  this benchmark reds.
* **The verdict needs UNANIMITY across the samples, and a near-boundary result is `unresolved`
  rather than rounded to the convenient side.** Wall-clock on a loaded machine cannot separate
  1.9s from 2.1s, and the gate decides whether a whole atom gets built.
  `fanout_measure.INCONCLUSIVE_BAND_POINTS` set the precedent in this harness: a band the
  measurement cannot see through returns "unresolved" rather than a verdict. Narrowing the band to
  extract a decision is the move that precedent exists to forbid.
* **A repo under :data:`BENCHMARK_MIN_FILES` cannot deliver the gate verdict at all.** §1.1 names
  the benchmark case (a 10K-file repo, fan-out of 4); a fast result on a small repo says nothing
  about it, so the gate reports `unresolved` with the reason rather than an unearned `skip`.

The synthetic repo exists because the measurement has to be reproducible by someone who does not
have a 10K-file checkout handy: :func:`synthesize_repo` builds one deterministically (content is a
function of the index, so two runs produce byte-identical blobs and comparable timings).

**Telling hydration apart from the machine.** Two checks, because a number that measures ambient
load rather than working-tree hydration answers the wrong question and looks identical:

1. The mechanized one: the verdict requires every sample to agree (see :func:`evaluate_gate`), so
   a run whose observations straddle the gate returns `unresolved` instead of leaning on a mean
   that a single unlucky sample can move.
2. The manual one, worth running whenever the answer matters: re-run with ``--files 40`` in the
   same window. A 40-file worktree has essentially nothing to hydrate, so its per-worktree number
   is the floor — process spawn, git startup, repo metadata, ambient load. Subtract that floor
   before believing the benchmark arm is about hydration at all.

Usage::

    python -m harness worktree-bench                    # synthesize 10K files, fan out 4
    python -m harness worktree-bench --repo /path/to/repo --width 4
    python -m harness worktree-bench --contended --json  # record the load caveat + emit the dict

Never runs against the real Gideon home: worktrees land under an explicit temp home and the
run refuses to proceed if that home resolves to the default one.

    page cache and any concurrent load lands on whichever sample is unlucky — so there is no
    trustworthy central estimate to compare against a threshold. What IS trustworthy is agreement:

    Measured, and the reason the rule is this and not a mean-vs-threshold test: HC-1's own
    benchmark run produced samples from 4.2s to 12.0s. A mean (6.5s) with a spread larger than
    itself looks like pure noise, and a spread-based rule refused to answer — yet every one of
