"""Slice 3 exemplar — secrets: `{{secret:KEY}}` resolution + RedactingSink (WF2-R14).

Slice 3 added side-effect, scope, termination and secret handling. This exemplar isolates
the secret half — the part with the sharpest failure mode (a leaked credential in the
journal, which the flywheel reads, bug reports ship, and the UI renders). Two mechanisms:

1. `{{secret:KEY}}` resolves ONLY through an injected resolver — bindings never touch the
   credential store directly, so a unit/exemplar run supplies its own resolver and an
   unset key raises a typed BindingError rather than resolving to nothing.
2. the RedactingSink: a credential that reaches a node's OUTPUT never lands on disk — the
   journal scrubs it on the way out. This exemplar drives a real run whose (fake) model
   returns a secret-shaped token, then greps the entire run directory to prove the token
   is nowhere on disk.

Runnable standalone: `python -m harness.exemplars.slice_3.exemplar` (or `smoke.sh`).
