"""Slice 5 exemplar — the human-input contract: gates surface, and time out to FAILED (WF2-R7).

Slice 5 added the typed ask payload, gate timeouts, and the needs-input path. This exemplar
drives the two ends of a gate's life against the real controller:

1. an unanswered `approval` gate does not wedge and does not silently pass — the run
   settles at `needs_input`, carrying a typed ask payload the attention surface renders;
2. a gate with a `timeout_secs` that nobody answers times out to `FAILED` — emphatically
   NOT a pass. A timed-out gate reading as approval is how an unattended run would "approve"
   something no human ever saw (WF2-R7).

Runnable standalone: `python -m harness.exemplars.slice_5.exemplar` (or `smoke.sh`). The
timeout leg uses a 1s `timeout_secs`, so the whole exemplar stays well under 30s.
