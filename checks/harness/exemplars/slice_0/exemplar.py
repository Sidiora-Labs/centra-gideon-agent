"""Slice 0 exemplar — data model, spec-ingestion validator, and the binding grammar.

Slice 0 is the foundation the engine stands on: the `Node`/`WorkflowRun` model, the
never-throw structural validator (typed issues + Kahn level grouping), and the binding
resolver. This exemplar drives all three WITHOUT the engine — Slice 0 is pre-engine, so its
mechanism is exercised directly rather than through a run:

1. a well-formed spec validates clean and the validator returns its concurrency levels;
2. a spec that references a non-existent node id is FLAGGED (a typed issue, not an
   exception) — the validator never throws, because its output goes straight back to an
   author;
3. the binding grammar threads a value: `{{nodes.a.output.n}}` resolves against a context,
   and whole-value refs preserve their source type.

Runnable standalone: `python -m harness.exemplars.slice_0.exemplar` (or `smoke.sh`).
`main()` self-asserts and returns 0 when all three hold, non-zero otherwise.
