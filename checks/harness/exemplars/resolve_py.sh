# shellcheck shell=bash
# Interpreter resolution for the exemplar smoke scripts. SOURCED, never executed — hence a
# `shell` directive rather than a shebang (shellcheck SC2148); the sourcing scripts own that.
#
# Sets `PY` to a Python that actually has this repo's dev dependencies, or exits 1 saying how to
# supply one. Sourced by every `slice_*/smoke.sh` so the rule lives once — six copies of it is
# what let the bug below survive in all six at the same time.
#
# 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS (#2718). The scripts used to resolve:
#
#     PY="${GIDEON_PY:-.venv/bin/python}"
#     [ -x "$PY" ] || PY="python3"
#
# `.venv/` lives in the PRIMARY checkout and a `git worktree` does not have one, so in any
# worktree the first path missed, the fallback took a bare `python3` off PATH with no
# `gideon` and no `jsonschema` installed, and the exemplar died on an ImportError. The
# failure is misleading in the worst way: it lands in `tests/test_harness_exemplars.py`, a file
# the change under review did not touch, and it reads like a dependency problem rather than a
# wrong interpreter. Three separate contributors each spent a diagnosis establishing "my diff is
# fine, this worktree has no venv" — and the conclusion was written into the contributor notes as
# folklore ("expect 3/11 red in harness-validate in any fresh worktree") rather than fixed.
#
# Worktrees are the NORMAL way to work in this repo, so that tax was paid by essentially everyone
# making an isolated change.
#
# TWO changes, because the issue is right that either would do and both are cheap:
#
#  1. `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves the venv from the PRIMARY checkout. In a worktree
#     it points at the primary repo's `.git`, so its parent is the checkout that holds `.venv`. In
#     an ordinary clone it is just `.git` and the parent is the repo root — the old behaviour,
#     unchanged.
#  2. It FAILS LOUDLY instead of falling through to `python3`. A wrong interpreter cannot produce
#     a useful error, only a plausible one, so there is nothing to gain by continuing: an
#     unresolvable interpreter now names both knobs instead of surfacing 30 lines later as a
#     missing module.
#
# `GIDEON_PY` still wins outright when set, which is how CI and any non-venv setup pin it.

  # This checkout first: in an ordinary clone this is the answer and no `git` call is needed.
