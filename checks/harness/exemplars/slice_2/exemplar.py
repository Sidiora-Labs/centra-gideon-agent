"""Slice 2 exemplar — engine-owned completion via the `required_artifacts` gate (WF2-R3).

A 3-node run whose middle node CLAIMS success but writes no file. The engine's artifact
gate (`apply_artifact_gate`, applied at the single dispatch seam so every node kind
inherits it) refuses the claimed completion and fails the node — so the run ends FAILED
rather than COMPLETE, and the third node never runs. This is the mechanism Slice 2 added:
completion is the engine's decision, checked against the filesystem, not the node's
self-report. "A node said it wrote the file" is a weaker claim than a passing node looks.

Runnable standalone: `python -m harness.exemplars.slice_2.exemplar` (or `smoke.sh`, which
isolates GIDEON_HOME first). `main()` self-asserts and returns 0 on the expected
outcome, non-zero on a surprise — that return code is what the smoke script and the proving
test (`tests/test_harness_exemplars.py`) read.
