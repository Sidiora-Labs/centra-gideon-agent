"""Slice 4 exemplar — mid-flight mutation: the binding cascade + the resume cache (WF2-R2/A1).

Slice 4 added mutation, checkpoints and fork. This exemplar exercises the correctness core:
editing a node re-runs exactly its BINDING closure — every node transitively downstream
through `{{nodes.x.output}}` references — and NOTHING else. The subtlety it defends (WF2-R2)
is that a later SIBLING that consumes an edited node's output is not a tree descendant; a
tree-based reset would leave it holding a stale input, a silently inconsistent run.

Two mechanisms, one pure and one end-to-end:

1. `binding_closure` / `cascade_preview` compute the re-run set from bindings, not the tree
   — the sibling consumer is in the closure, the unrelated node is not.
2. driven through a real controller: run a sequence to completion, edit the middle node's
   prompt, resume — and assert from the LEDGER that exactly the closure re-ran (the resume
   cache served the untouched prefix at zero model calls). This is the acceptance bar
   Slice 4 set: answerable from the ledger, not from logs.

Runnable standalone: `python -m checks.harness.exemplars.slice_4.exemplar` (or `smoke.sh`).
