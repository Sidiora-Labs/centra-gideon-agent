"""Slice 1 exemplar — the pure frontier, the engine, and the journal-backed run (WF2 §Slice 1).

A three-node sequence driven end to end against a temp home with only the model call faked:
`seed` (transform) → `think` (infer, binding-fed) → `final` (transform, consuming think).
It exercises the load-bearing Slice-1 machinery at once: the pure `frontier()` scheduling
one node at a time in dependency order, the dispatchers, binding resolution threading a
value from node to node, terminal-status ownership, and the Run Ledger emission.

Runnable standalone: `python -m checks.harness.exemplars.slice_1.exemplar` (or `smoke.sh`).
`main()` self-asserts and returns 0 on the expected COMPLETE outcome, non-zero otherwise.
