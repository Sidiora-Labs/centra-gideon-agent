"""Concurrent tool-dispatch benchmark + HC-6's before/after gate (HARNESS-CRAFT HC-6).

HC-6 is a concurrency change, and a concurrency change with no before-number cannot be
shown to have helped — so it inherits HC-1's measure-first discipline rather than inventing
a second one. The three decisions HC-1 made structurally are made the same way here:

* **The benchmark reads the SHIPPED log line; it does not keep its own stopwatch.**
  Durations come from parsing :data:`~gideon.agents.native.dispatch_plan.
  TIMING_LOG_PREFIX`'s ``tool batch`` row, so the number in this report is the number
  production emits, and the log-line contract gets a real reader — change its fields and
  this benchmark reds.
* **The verdict needs UNANIMITY, and a near-boundary result is `unresolved`.** Every
  concurrent sample must beat every serial sample by more than the band. A mean-vs-mean
  comparison on a machine that also runs test suites is luck, not a measurement, and this
  gate decides whether a concurrency change is claimed to have worked.
* **The baseline arm is production code, not a simulation of it.** It is the same runtime
  with ``max_tool_concurrency=1``, which makes every wave one call wide — i.e. exactly the
  pre-HC-6 dispatch. A separate "serial mode" written for the benchmark would be free to
  differ from the real serial path, and the whole comparison would rest on that difference.

The turn being measured, :data:`MULTI_LOOKUP_TURN`, is a representative multi-lookup turn:
eight independent read-only lookups — three greps, two globs, a repo map and two file
reads — no two of which touch the same path, which is the shape the atom is about. It is
deliberately all-reads: a write in the turn would serialize against the readers of its path
and the benchmark would then be measuring the reservation rule instead of the concurrency.

Usage::

    python -m harness dispatch-bench                  # synthesize a repo, both arms
    python -m harness dispatch-bench --trials 7 --json
    python -m harness dispatch-bench --repo /path/to/repo --contended

Never runs against the real Gideon home: the synthesized repo and everything the
turn touches live under a temp dir that is removed on the way out.
