# 🦞 Gideon — Visual Showcase

A guided tour of Gideon: a self-hosted personal AI agent that unifies agentic chat,
autonomous goal loops, long-term memory, a knowledge base, skills, and automation behind
one gateway and one dashboard you own.

> _Every screen below is a **real capture** from a running instance seeded with illustrative
> scenario data — shown in both **light** and **dark** themes. No mockups. The set is
> reproducible per release via the capture pipeline ([docs/screenshots/CAPTURE.md](docs/screenshots/CAPTURE.md)).
> Architecture diagrams accompany the screens whose *flow* is as important as their look._

## 🏠 The Dashboard

Your day at a glance: quick stats, a prompt bar that starts a chat or a task, "jump back in"
sessions, live tasks, contextual suggestions the system draws from your memory and knowledge,
and a real-time system strip — all live over one WebSocket.

## 🗣️ Agentic Chat

Conversational sessions where the agent acts with full tool access. It **grounds answers in
your knowledge** (note the "worked through 3 steps · knowledge_search" and the cited source
below), and tool calls surface as decision-ready approval prompts. Sessions fork, undo,
branch into variants, and organize into folders/tags/kanban.

## 📚 Knowledge Base

Ingest notes, gists, bookmarks, documents, and media. A node-graph pipeline extracts
entities and relations, generates summaries, and embeds every item for semantic search —
here, **7 items → 50 entities → 32 relations**, all reachable by the agent in chat.

## 🧠 Memory — a distinct store

A deliberate boundary: **Memory** is the harness's own learning about you (facts, episodes,
lessons); **Knowledge** is your personal library. They never bleed into each other. The
Memory Studio visualizes facts, documents, and their graph.

## ✅ Tasks

A full task system — list, cards, **kanban**, and dependency-graph views — with priorities,
labels, statuses, and one-click completion. The agent can file and update tasks through its
tools, so what you plan and what it does stay in one place.

## 🎯 Goal Loops

Give the agent a target; it classifies, plans, and loops **one cycle at a time** under a
deterministic supervisor — observable, pausable, resumable. Five kinds — General, Goal,
Code (SDLC), Research, and Design — each with depth and attended/unattended modes.

## ⏰ Triggers & 🔁 Workflows

Cron / interval / webhook **triggers** fire background work — a native action, a saved
prompt, a workflow, or an agent — with human-readable schedules and next-fire times.
**Workflows** are reusable SOPs (ordered playbooks) surfaced by scope + semantic match.

## 🧩 Skills & 🔌 App Platform

Reusable **SKILL.md** procedures from a marketplace, and an **everything-is-an-app**
platform: 27 built-in apps ship in-package, and every vendor — models, search, speech,
channels, agent runtimes — installs as a removable app through a quarantine → scan →
consent lifecycle. A "dangerous" scan verdict is terminal and non-overridable.

## 🤖 Agents

Multiple built-in agents cooperate — a default conversational agent plus specialized
workers for goal loops, the code SDLC engine, planning, and background consolidation —
all filesystem-defined over the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and fully editable.

## ⚙️ Settings — provider-agnostic by design

One hub for the whole system. **Models** are assigned per use case (chat, embedding, STT,
TTS, image, audio, video) from whatever providers you've added — here, `claude-sonnet-5`
for chat and `text-embedding-3-small` for embeddings, chosen from **108** discovered models.
Nothing ties you to one vendor.

## 🚀 Onboarding

A short first-run flow: your name, a chat model, and you're in. Warm coral identity on
calm surfaces — "companion, not console."

## Reproduce this showcase

Every screen above is reproducible in both themes from a seeded instance. Configure a model
provider, seed a little scenario data, then run the capture pipeline:

```bash
# see docs/screenshots/CAPTURE.md for the full walkthrough
GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none gideon gateway --port 10000 --no-open
GIDEON_URL=http://localhost:10000 node docs/screenshots/capture.mjs   # light/ + dark/, every route
```

The pipeline follows the same seed-data → headless-capture pattern used across the
project's sibling repos, so the showcase stays honest (real UI, illustrative data) and
current (re-run per release).
