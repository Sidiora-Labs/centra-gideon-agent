"""Render the ACP not-gateable residual registry INTO the parity doc (AAP-5 §2.2).

``ACP-AGENT-PARITY.md`` §2.2 requires that the residual not-gateable set be
enumerated in ONE place — :data:`gideon.integrations.acp.permission_authority.NOT_GATEABLE`
— and that §2.7's parity doc (``docs/agents/acp-parity.md``) **render** that
registry rather than re-derive it in prose. A hand-written table beside the
registry is exactly the drift the requirement exists to prevent, and it had
already happened: the doc's third column carried sweep prose
("44 audited tool events…") that appears nowhere in the registry, and the
per-entry ``observation`` — the field whose whole job is to name the measurement
that PROVED the residue — was not in the doc at all.

Mechanism (the house generator idiom — ``tooling/scripts/generate_*_baseline.py`` plus a
companion pytest ratchet): this script owns one marker-delimited block inside the
doc. Everything between :data:`MARKER_BEGIN` and :data:`MARKER_END` is generated;
everything outside it is hand-written prose that states MECHANISM, never the
enumeration.

    python tooling/scripts/render_acp_parity_residual.py            # write the block
    python tooling/scripts/render_acp_parity_residual.py --check     # fail on drift

``checks/runtime/test_acp_parity_residual_render.py`` is the always-on rail: it fails when
the doc and the registry disagree, and it carries a vacuity floor so a rail that
matches NOTHING cannot read as clean.

Deliberately shape-LOOSE. The registry is co-owned and still moving (a provider,
a field, or a third residual state may land at any time), so a renderer that
enumerates field names by hand would just relocate the drift. Instead every
*scalar* dataclass field is rendered under its own name and every
*collection-shaped* field is treated as matching machinery and skipped — so a new
``str`` field, or a new ``Enum``-valued state, appears in the doc on the next run
with no edit here.
