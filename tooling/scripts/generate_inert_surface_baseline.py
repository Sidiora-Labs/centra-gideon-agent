"""Committed inert-surface inventory baseline (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS SH3.2).

A recurring defect class in this codebase: something is *declared* and nothing on the
other side of the seam consumes or produces it — a config key no ``load()`` mapping
reads, an enum member no code references, a trigger kind with no dispatch, an editable-
config entry with no backing field, an SDK export nothing imports. Tests pass anyway
because they hand-build the state the missing writer should have produced. A round-trip
or unit test cannot see the gap; only a *census of both ends of each seam* can.

This generator IS that census. For each of five declared-surface kinds it enumerates the
declared surfaces, applies a cheap deterministic writer/reader heuristic, and emits a
per-file counter of inert surfaces to a committed ``checks/catalogs/inert-surfaces.json``. A
companion test (``checks/runtime/test_inert_surface_baseline.py``) regenerates in-memory and
asserts every per-file counter **may only shrink** versus the committed baseline: a NEW
declared-but-inert surface raises a file's count and reds CI, naming the file and the
surface; a cleanup that adds the missing writer/reader lowers it and is welcome.

⚠️  FORBIDDEN-TO-RAISE RULE (the whole point — do not weaken it): when this baseline reds
    CI because a counter ROSE, the fix is to ADD THE MISSING WRITER OR READER for the new
    surface — never to regenerate the baseline to bless the higher number. Regenerating to
    make a rising count green re-hides exactly the defect this file exists to surface.
    Regeneration is legitimate ONLY when a counter LEGITIMATELY SHRANK (a real cleanup
    landed) — and then it must happen in that same commit.

⚠️  SHIP AT THE MEASURED POPULATION, NOT AT ZERO. A never-run gate given teeth at zero is
    an outage: it would red every existing declared-but-inert surface at once. So this
    tool MEASURES the current population and commits the real (non-zero) number as the
    floor; the ratchet only forbids *growth*. Driving the count down (one file per commit,
    each proving a writer now exists) is a separate effort (SH3.3), not this atom. In
    particular ``SafetyProfile`` (guardrails/policy.py) is expected to appear as inert and
    is left for PHF-8 to wire — do not "fix" any surface this census reports here.

Detection heuristics are calibrated for a LOW false-positive rate (they under-report
rather than cry wolf, mirroring ``checks/harness/scanner.py``): a "reader" found anywhere in
production ``src/`` clears a surface, so the census only reports the strongest declared-
and-untouched cases. Readers in ``checks/runtime/`` deliberately do NOT count — a test that
references a surface is exactly the hand-built state that hides the seam gap.

⚠️  A FALSE RED IS A BUG IN THIS TOOL, AND THE FIX IS TO TEACH IT THE SHAPE. The census
    governs which cleanups get picked, so a surface it reports must really be unreachable.
    When a reported surface turns out to be reachable through a consumption shape the
    detector does not recognise, the fix is to TEACH THE DETECTOR THAT SHAPE — never to
    delete the line from the baseline by hand, and never to relax the forbidden-to-raise
    rule. ``PHF-12`` did exactly that for whole-enum iteration: ``Lineage.INFORMED_BY`` and
    ``Lineage.RELATED`` were reported inert while ``workflows/publish.py:136`` validated
    author-supplied edges against ``{e.value for e in Lineage}``, so a template author
    could reach both members and the census called them dead.

    THE CONVERSE ALSO HOLDS, AND ``PHF-13`` RULED ON IT: a shape is only worth teaching when it
    PROVES reachability. Value-lookup ``E(value)`` does not, so it is deliberately NOT taught —
    the per-site provenance audit and the arithmetic behind that ruling live in
    ``_inert_enum_members``. Clearing a member on a construction that never executes, or one fed
    only from state this codebase itself wrote, would HIDE a real gap instead of naming it, and a
    false clear is the one error this census must not make quietly.

The render is DETERMINISTIC: files, surface lists, and per-kind totals are all sorted,
the output is ``json.dumps(..., indent=2, sort_keys=True)`` with a trailing newline, and
it carries no timestamps or absolute paths. A second run is byte-identical to the first.

Per-surface-kind heuristic (each documented at its detector below):
  * ``config``          — a leaf config field (from the SH3.1 config walk) whose name is
                          not set in ``AppConfig.load()``'s mapping (no reader).
  * ``enum``            — an Enum member whose name is never accessed as an attribute
                          anywhere in ``src/`` AND whose class is never iterated as a whole
                          (declared and reachable through neither path).
  * ``trigger_kind``    — a kind in ``triggers.models.KINDS`` whose literal appears in no
                          other file under ``triggers/`` (declared, nothing dispatches it).
  * ``editable_config`` — an ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` PATCH-allowlist key with no backing
                          config field (the entry edits nothing).
  * ``sdk_export``      — a ``gideon.sdk.*`` ``__all__`` symbol imported nowhere
                          outside the sdk package (no in-repo consumer). The SDK is a
                          facade for installable app bundles that live in a SEPARATE repo,
                          so most exports look inert from here — which is precisely why
                          this counter is large and why it ratchets rather than zeroes.

    THE RULE (two independent clears, either one is enough):

    1. the member's name is accessed as an attribute somewhere in production ``src/``
       (``E.MEMBER``) — a direct reader; or
    2. the member's ENUM CLASS is iterated as a whole anywhere in production ``src/`` —
       whole-enum iteration reaches every member by construction, so ONE iteration site
       clears ALL of that class's members.

    DETECTED ITERATION SHAPES: ``for m in E`` (and ``async for``); all four comprehension
    forms over ``E`` (``{e.value for e in E}``, ``[e.value for e in E]``, dict and generator);
    and ``list``/``tuple``/``set``/``frozenset``/``sorted``/``iter``/``reversed``/
    ``enumerate`` applied to ``E``. Each shape is matched on a bare name (``E``) or a
    module-qualified one (``mutations.OpKind``), resolved through the iterating file's OWN
    imports — ``src/`` declares seven distinct ``Verdict`` enums, so a name-only index would
    let one file's iteration clear another file's members.

    DELIBERATELY NOT DETECTED (each stays on the under-reporting side — a member reachable
    only this way is still reported, so the tool keeps crying wolf rather than going quiet):
    ``E.__members__`` / ``_member_map_`` walks, ``getattr(E, name)``, value-lookup
    construction (``E(value)``), ``value in E`` containment, iteration over a local alias
    (``alias = E; for m in alias``), and consumers outside this repo.

    ERROR DIRECTION, STATED HONESTLY: clearing a whole class from ONE iteration site trades
    MORE under-reporting (a class that is iterated somewhere keeps no member reported, even a
    member that genuinely has no producer) for the elimination of an entire false-red class.
    That is the deliberate trade — this census exists to name work worth doing, and a
    reported surface that is actually reachable sends someone to "fix" working code.

    VALUE-LOOKUP ``E(value)`` IS DELIBERATELY NOT TAUGHT — audited and ruled on by ``PHF-13``.
    ``PHF-12`` left it named as the "known remaining false-red shape" on the strength of
    ``judge_contract.py:342`` (``Verdict(str(raw.get("verdict", "")).upper())`` on model-emitted
    text). Auditing all six value-lookup sites behind the surviving enum surfaces found that
    premise WRONG and the shape unsound as a clearing rule: ``E(value)`` proves reachability only
    when BOTH hold — the construction actually EXECUTES in production, and its value crosses a
    trust/authoring boundary. Per site:

      * ``tasks/models.py:74`` ``DependencyType(raw_type)`` — EXTERNALLY REACHABLE. Reached from
        ``POST /api/tasks``: ``tasks/handlers.py:242`` calls ``create_task(**body)`` on
        ``await request.json()``, ``tasks/native.py:246`` coerces it, ``TaskDependency.from_dict``
        looks the member up. A client picks the member. This one IS a false red, and is the only
        one; it stays reported rather than being cleared by an unsound rule.
      * ``memory_record.py:216``/``:218`` ``MemoryTier(...)``/``MemoryScope(...)`` — INTERNAL ONLY.
        Fed by ``from_semantic_row``/``from_episodic_row`` (``vector_memory.py:1124``/``:1161``)
        off rows this codebase wrote via ``to_row``; the vault mirror is render-only (no parse
        back). Nothing writes ``"segment"`` or ``"workspace"``, so neither member round-trips in.
      * ``workflows/confirmation.py:177`` ``Status(...)`` — INTERNAL ONLY. ``from_dict`` reads what
        ``to_dict`` wrote, and that is only ``pending``/``expired``: ``resolve`` returns a
        ``Resolution`` and never stamps ``RESOLVED``.
      * ``workflows/judge_actors.py:84`` ``Actor(...)`` — DEAD CALL SITE. Only
        ``resolve_transition`` calls it, and nothing in ``src/`` calls that (tests only).
      * ``workflows/judge_contract.py:342`` ``Verdict(...)`` — DEAD CALL SITE. ``validate_verdict``
        has no production caller; ``engine.py:1510`` deliberately RESTATES the aggregation rule
        instead of importing it. Model-emitted text never reaches this constructor.
      * ``judge_contract.py:224`` ``enum_cls(str(value))`` (``Ratchet``) — DEAD CALL SITE for the
        same reason (``hints_from_dict`` has no production caller), and invisible to an
        ``E(value)`` rule regardless: the class is loop-bound, not named at the call.

    So a syntactic ``E(value)`` rule would clear six classes of which exactly ONE is genuinely
    reachable — a 5-of-6 false-clear rate. A false clear is worse here than the over-report it
    replaces: it buries a genuine gap inside every internal deserializer. Proving "provably
    outside" needs interprocedural dataflow (four hops across three modules for the
    ``DependencyType`` case), which is not a cheap deterministic AST rule, so the rule stays as
    it is. ``test_value_lookup_alone_does_not_clear_a_member`` pins that decision, and
    ``test_the_audited_value_lookup_call_sites_have_no_production_caller`` reds if a dead site
    above is ever wired up — at which point re-verdict the member instead of trusting this list.

    Path-typed (no repo-relative rendering) so the detector can be exercised against a
    fixture tree; ``_inert_enum_surfaces`` is the thin repo-relative wrapper.
