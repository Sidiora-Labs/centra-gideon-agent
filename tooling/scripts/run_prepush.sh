# Pre-push gate — Python lint + the frontend render-smoke rail (invoked by
# .githooks/pre-push).
#
# The render-smoke half was born from the v0.1.0 blank-dashboard release:
# typecheck + vitest + vite build all passed while the built bundle crashed at
# first render in a real browser (dual-React dependency skew). That gate re-runs
# the whole frontend chain from a CLEAN, locked install — `npm ci` is the step
# that catches declared-vs-resolved tree skew — then mounts the built SPA in
# headless Chromium (scripts/render_smoke.mjs) before the push leaves the machine.
#
# The Python lint half exists because pre-commit only formats the files a commit
# STAGES: commits made before `hooks:install`, or with `--no-verify`, sail past it
# and CI's `lint` job is the first thing that notices. This re-checks the whole
# tree under the same tools CI uses, so a lint break is caught before the push.
#
# Scope: each half runs ONLY when the outgoing commits touch paths it owns, so a
# backend-only push skips the frontend chain and vice versa. Ref ranges arrive on
# stdin per githooks(5).
#
# Bypass: none built in. `git push --no-verify` exists for owner-declared
# emergencies only (AGENTS.md) — a red gate means the push ships something broken.
