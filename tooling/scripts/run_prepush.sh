# Pre-push gate — Python lint + the frontend render-smoke rail (invoked by
# .githooks/pre-push).
#
# The render-smoke half was born from the v0.1.0 blank-dashboard release:
# typecheck + vitest + vite build all passed while the built bundle crashed at
# first render in a real browser (dual-React dependency skew). That gate re-runs
# the whole frontend chain from a CLEAN, locked install — `npm ci` is the step
# that catches declared-vs-resolved tree skew — then mounts the built SPA in
# headless Chromium (scripts/render_smoke.mjs) before the push leaves the machine.
#
# The Python lint half exists because pre-commit only formats the files a commit
# STAGES: commits made before `hooks:install`, or with `--no-verify`, sail past it
# and CI's `lint` job is the first thing that notices. This re-checks the whole
# tree under the same tools CI uses, so a lint break is caught before the push.
#
# Scope: each half runs ONLY when the outgoing commits touch paths it owns, so a
# backend-only push skips the frontend chain and vice versa. Ref ranges arrive on
# stdin per githooks(5).
#
# The tree/ref guard exists because those two facts do not agree by themselves.
# Scope is decided from the outgoing REFS, but both halves then check the WORKING
# TREE (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) — and those are the same thing only when
# the ref being pushed is what this worktree has checked out. With many
# `git worktree`s in play they routinely are not: `git push origin some-branch`
# from a checkout sitting on `main` scopes the gate by some-branch's diff and then
# validates main's tree. It goes green and proves nothing about what shipped.
# Batching pushes (`git push origin br1 br2 br3`) to pay the ~20-minute `npm ci` +
# render-smoke cost once instead of three times is exactly how that happens. So
# every outgoing ref must resolve to this worktree's HEAD commit or the push is
# refused — one push per worktree, from the worktree that owns the branch. Refs are
# peeled to a commit first (`^{commit}`): an annotated tag's own object SHA is never
# a commit, and tagging the merge commit on `main` from a `main` checkout is the
# documented release step (docs/maintainers/release-runbook.md).
#
# Bypass: none built in. `git push --no-verify` exists for owner-declared
# emergencies only (AGENTS.md) — a red gate means the push ships something broken.
