"""DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE: measure the STALE-INDEX half of `DCU-3`'s ``done_when``, live.

`DCU-3`'s clause has two halves::

    With the enable on, snapshotting a TextEdit window then AXPress-ing a button by index and
    typing into a field succeeds without the pointer moving; a stale index (past TTL or
    changed fingerprint) refuses and forces a re-snapshot.

PR #2552 measured the first half on a real desktop and said so explicitly: it *"exercised the
fresh path only"*. This script measures the second half — **both triggers, separately** — and
carries the fresh-path positive control beside them, because a harness that only ever sees
refusals has not distinguished *"staleness is caught"* from *"everything is refused"*.

**Every step goes through** :func:`gideon.integrations.computer_use.service.computer_dispatch`, never
the driver and never the FFI. Dispatch is the only entry point this plan shipped; reaching
around it would prove the driver works and say nothing about the chain meant to restrain it.
The one FFI call this script makes is :func:`macos_ffi.list_gui_apps`, and it is not a drive —
it is the teardown census, taken *before* anything is launched so cleanup can quit only what
this run started.

**The grant is probed FIRST and an ungranted machine reports ``unproven``, never green.** A
skip that reads as a pass is the failure mode this repo keeps rediscovering, and it has already
bitten this atom once: `DCU-3`'s recorded reason said the grant could not be had, when nobody
had asked the OS. The symmetric error is to assume it *can* be had because it once was — so
this script asks again, every run, and reports what the OS answered.

**Why the grant is not a property of the workstation.** macOS resolves an Accessibility request
against the *responsible* process, not the binary that called ``AXIsProcessTrusted()``. For an
interpreter started from a terminal or a host application, the responsible process is that
terminal or application — so the same machine, the same python and the same repo answer True in
one session and False in another. :func:`_preflight` therefore reports the mechanism and the
command that names the identity the operator must actually grant, instead of naming a binary
that may not be the one being asked about.

**Three refusals share one code, so the message is the discriminator.** ``_stale()`` in
``service`` raises ``ERR_COMPUTER_USE_STALE_INDEX`` for an unknown/evicted snapshot id, for a
past-TTL id, and for a changed fingerprint. A harness that asserted only the code would report
"stale index refused" for a typo'd snapshot id, which measures nothing. Each leg below asserts
the detail it expects and asserts the other two details are ABSENT, and
``test_the_three_stale_index_details_stay_distinguishable`` pins those strings so a refactor
that collapsed them reds the suite instead of quietly hollowing out this script.

**Driver spawns are counted, and the count is the second discriminator.** The past-TTL check
(step 3a) runs before any driver call; the fingerprint check (step 3b) runs *because* of one.
So a past-TTL refusal that reached the driver, or a fingerprint refusal that did not, is a
different bug wearing the same code. The counter wraps ``service._run_driver`` and calls
through — remove it and every leg behaves identically.

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=src python tooling/scripts/dcu3_stale_index_validate.py

Exit status 0 only when every clause holds. Anything unproven is reported as ``unproven`` with
the reason, never silently dropped. The run sleeps once for the snapshot TTL (read from
``service.SNAPSHOT_TTL_SECS``, not hardcoded), so it takes about a minute.
