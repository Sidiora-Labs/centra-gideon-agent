"""Committed docs-lint + plan-hygiene baseline generator (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §6.2).

CLAUDE.md and EXECUTION-PROTOCOL §3 both require docs to move with the change, but nothing
mechanical enforced it: docs routinely drift from code (a governance doc documenting a
matcher the code has since removed) and plan ``**Status:**`` headers drift from their own
execution logs (the 2026-08-04 audit found 25 of 66 headers wrong). This generator is the
census that makes that drift visible. It scans tracked ``docs/**/*.md`` and emits a
deterministic per-file counter of three finding kinds to a committed
``docs-lint-baseline.json``; a companion test (``checks/runtime/test_docs_lint_baseline.py``)
regenerates in-memory and asserts every per-file counter **may only shrink** — a NEW dead
link, stale citation, or stale header raises a file's count and reds CI, naming the file
and the finding; a cleanup that removes one lowers it and is welcome.

The three checks (each deliberately calibrated to UNDER-report rather than cry wolf, so a
red is always a real regression):

1. ``dead_link`` — a *relative* markdown link ``[text](target)`` whose ``target`` (after
   stripping any ``#anchor``) resolves, relative to the linking file's directory, to a repo
   path that is not tracked. External schemes (``http(s)://``, ``mailto:``, ``tel:``,
   ``ftp://``, protocol-relative ``//``), pure ``#anchor`` intra-doc links, and
   absolute (``/``-leading) targets are skipped — none of those are relative repo-file
   links. Links inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans are stripped before
   matching (DSL/example syntax like ``[field](value)`` is not a link), and only path-like
   targets (containing ``/`` or a known file extension) are considered. We do NOT validate
   that a ``#anchor`` exists inside the target file — anchor text is unstable and that would
   cry wolf; a missing *file* is the unambiguous signal.

2. ``stale_citation`` — a ``path/to/file.py:NNN`` citation in docs prose whose FILE cannot
   be found in the repository. Citations are matched with ``([\\w/.-]+\\.py):(\\d+)`` and a
   citation counts as stale ONLY when the file is missing (no tracked path equals it or ends
   with ``/<citation>``, so an abbreviated ``config/loader.py`` still resolves to
   ``runtime/gideon/core/config/loader.py``). A DRIFTED LINE NUMBER (file exists, the ``:NNN``
   points at a different line) is **NOT** counted: roadmap prose is full of ``file.py:NNN``
   citations whose line numbers drift constantly — SELF-VERIFICATION explicitly mandates
   "specs reference stable anchors, never line numbers" precisely because line-drift is
   chronic — so validating that every ``:NNN`` points at a semantically-correct line is
   impossible and noisy. Only a stale PATH is a hard dead citation.

3. ``stale_header`` — **DORMANT since the plans left this repository.** The check is scoped
   to ``docs/roadmap/plans/``, and that tree is no longer published (it is internal planning
   state, kept in the maintainer's workspace), so this kind can never fire against a real
   file here. It is retained rather than deleted because its reproduction test seeds a
   synthetic path under that prefix and still proves the checker works — so if plans ever
   return to the repository the check engages immediately. Said plainly because a checker
   that cannot fire, left undocumented, reads as coverage it does not provide.

   A plan under ``docs/roadmap/plans/`` whose ``**Status:**`` header
   matches a stale shape (``DESIGNED``/``PROPOSED``/``READY``/``NOT STARTED``) while the file
   carries a populated ``## Execution log`` containing a ``DONE`` entry: the exact "plan
   headers lie" drift the 2026-08-04 audit surfaced. The ``**Status:**`` line is parsed with
   the SAME regex ``tooling/gen_roadmap_dashboard.py`` uses, so the two agree. This is a
   heuristic, not a proof — it reproduces the known audit finding on a seeded stale header;
   it does not attempt to adjudicate every real header against reality (the log and the code
   win over the header, so this ratchets rather than blocks).

⚠️  FORBIDDEN-TO-RAISE RULE — "fix the doc, not the baseline" (the whole point; do not weaken
    it): when this baseline reds CI because a counter ROSE, the fix is to FIX THE DOC —
    repair the dead link, update or remove the stale citation, or reconcile the plan header
    with its execution log — NEVER to regenerate ``docs-lint-baseline.json`` to bless the
    higher number. Regenerating to make a rising count green re-hides exactly the drift this
    census exists to surface. Regeneration is legitimate ONLY when a counter LEGITIMATELY
    SHRANK (a real doc fix landed) — and then it must happen in that same commit.

⚠️  SHIP AT THE MEASURED POPULATION, NOT AT ZERO. A never-run gate given teeth at zero is an
    outage: it would red every pre-existing dead link, stale citation, and stale header at
    once. So this tool MEASURES the current population and commits the real (non-zero) number
    as the floor; the ratchet only forbids *growth*. Driving the count down (fixing the
    docs) is a separate cleanup effort, not this atom — do not "fix" any finding this census
    reports here.

The render is DETERMINISTIC: the tracked-file set and every finding list are sorted, paths
are POSIX repo-relative, the output is ``json.dumps(..., indent=2, sort_keys=True)`` with a
trailing newline, and it carries no timestamps or absolute paths. A second run on the same
tree is byte-identical to the first.
