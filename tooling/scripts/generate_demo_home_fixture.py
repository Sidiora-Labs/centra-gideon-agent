"""Regenerate the SQLite halves of the ``demo-home`` seed fixture.

``--seed`` is a bare ``shutil.copytree`` with no hydration hook, so every store a
seeded home is expected to serve has to already exist as a file in the fixture.
Most of ``demo-home`` is therefore hand-authored JSON/markdown and needs no tool.
Two surfaces cannot be: **knowledge** and **loops** are SQLite-only.

- Knowledge lives solely in ``workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db``
  (:func:`gideon.knowledge.store.knowledge_db_path`), whose schema includes an
  FTS5 virtual table. There is no boot-time re-ingest from any file, so markdown
  under ``workspace/knowledge/`` would simply never be read.
- A loop's row lives in ``loop/loops.db``. The file dir is the optional half: the
  boot-time ``reap_orphan_dirs()`` sweep **deletes** any ``loop/<8hex>/`` directory
  with no backing DB row, so a text-only loop fixture is silently wiped on first boot.

So this script builds those two ``.db`` files by driving the **real writers**
(``KnowledgeStore.create_typed_item`` and ``loop.store.create``) against a throwaway
home, then copies the results into the fixture tree. The shape is therefore correct
by construction rather than hand-transcribed, and re-running this after a schema
change is how the fixture is kept current.

Run it from the repo root, then commit the changed ``.db`` files::

    PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/generate_demo_home_fixture.py

``tests/test_seed_demo_home.py`` boots the fixture and asserts a non-zero count per
surface, so a schema change that invalidates these files fails loudly rather than
shipping a demo home that boots empty.
