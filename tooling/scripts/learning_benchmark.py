"""THE one command for the skill-impact benchmark (LEARNING-VISIBILITY T4.2).

    python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --preflight            # nothing is called
    python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --dry-run              # the paired cell plan
    python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --run                  # the paired runs
    python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --run --bind-provider LocalOllama:gemma4:12b
    python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --run --task sk_grill --trials 5
    python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --reproduce <baseline_run_id> --run

Protocol: `docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` (PROTOCOL v1, owner-signed
before any run). This script implements §3's arms, §4's metrics, §5's verdict rule and §8's
publication rules; it does not restate any of them.

Why a script and not a `gideon` subcommand: the verdict thresholds live in
`harness/fanout_measure.py`, and `harness` is a repo-root dev package that is deliberately NOT in
the shipped wheel. A CLI subcommand would have to import it from `src/`, stranding an import at
install time. So the benchmark is dev tooling that imports both trees, the verdict is computed
HERE, and it is **written into the report** — the gateway and the dashboard only read it. That is
also what makes an unmeasured task render as "not measured" rather than as `0.000`: no surface
downstream is able to synthesise a verdict or a score it was not given.

Why `--run` is explicit and there is no default: every trial is a real model call against a real
provider. §3 pairs `k = 5` trials per arm over ten tasks — 100 cells — so the default must be the
one that costs nothing. `--preflight` and `--dry-run` both call zero models.

Isolation: nothing here touches `~/.gideon`'s skills. Each cell runs in a spawned child
whose `GIDEON_HOME` is a per-cell temp dir seeded from the scenario's declared
`fixture_home`, and the `skills_off` arm's suppression is an overlay applied only inside that
child. The REPORT, however, is written under the invoking home's `evals/learning_bench/`, so run
this against an isolated `GIDEON_HOME` unless you mean to keep the results.

Why `--bind-provider` and not "use whatever this home has": a cell's environment is BUILT from a
name allowlist, not inherited, so no provider or credential reaches it by accident. `--run` on its
own therefore measures nothing — every cell resolves the offline scripted fixture — and the flag
names the ONE `Provider:model` ref the cells may call. The ref it names lands in the report's
`provider_binding`, so a published table can never be mistaken for the other kind of run.
