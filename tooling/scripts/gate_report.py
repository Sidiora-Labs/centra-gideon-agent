"""Aggregate report for the platform-hardening drift/inert gates (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §6).

The §3/§6 family shipped three independent gates, each a generator + committed baseline +
shrink/byte-compare ratchet test; ``PHF-14`` added three more (the STRUCTURAL ratchets),
registered here rather than beside here so that one structural red never hides the other
five — six gates, one table, every failure visible in a single run:

  * ``config-baseline`` (PHF-5) — ``scripts/generate_config_baseline.py`` renders the
    ``AppConfig`` schema; drift is a BYTE mismatch between the committed
    ``config-baseline.json`` and a fresh render.
  * ``inert-surface`` (PHF-6) — ``scripts/generate_inert_surface_baseline.py`` censuses
    declared-but-inert surfaces; drift is any per-file inert counter that ROSE
    (``regressions(committed_per_file, current_per_file)`` non-empty).
  * ``docs-lint`` (PHF-10) — ``scripts/generate_docs_lint_baseline.py`` censuses docs drift;
    drift is any per-file finding counter that ROSE (``regressions(...)`` non-empty).
  * ``structural-size`` / ``structural-import-direction`` / ``structural-duplication``
    (PHF-14) — ``scripts/generate_structural_baseline.py`` censuses the SHAPE of the tree
    (per-file size ceiling, declared layer order, re-derived implementation families). Each
    is a separate gate here, and each reports its own VACUITY failure (a rail that inspected
    fewer files than the census counted) alongside its backslides.

Each is its own pytest test that fails independently. A dev running them one at a time — or a
fail-fast runner — fixes one, re-runs, hits the next, fixes, re-runs… This aggregate runs ALL
SIX, collects EVERY failure, and prints ONE table so all failures are visible in a single
run. That is the §6 "aggregate, don't short-circuit" ergonomic: unlike ``harness/cli.py``'s
task runner (which stops at the first failing command), this NEVER short-circuits — a gate
that drifts, or even one that raises, is captured as a structured failure while every other
gate still runs.

The output is DETERMINISTIC: gates run in a fixed order, each gate's failures are already
sorted by the generator (``regressions()`` returns a sorted list; config's is a single fixed
line), and the table carries no timestamps or absolute paths. Exit status is ``0`` iff every
gate passes, else ``1``.
