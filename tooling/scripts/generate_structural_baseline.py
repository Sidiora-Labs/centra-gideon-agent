"""Committed STRUCTURAL ratchet baselines (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS PHF-14).

Structural decay is invisible until it is expensive. A file grows 300 lines a quarter and
nobody notices; a domain module reaches up into the HTTP layer and the dependency inverts
silently; a family we have already unified once gets re-derived a thirteenth time because
nothing counts. None of those show up in a unit test — the code works. Only a *census of
the shape of the tree* sees them.

This generator IS that census. It measures three structural properties of production
``src/gideon`` and commits them to ``structural-baseline.json`` as three INDEPENDENT
shrink-only ratchets:

  * ``structural-size`` — a per-file size ceiling no file may exceed, plus a shrink-only
    POPULATION of files in the watch band. A new giant reds; ordinary maintenance of an
    existing one does not.
  * ``structural-import-direction`` — a declared layer order. A lower layer may not import
    an upper one; each file's upward-edge count may only shrink.
  * ``structural-duplication`` — a duplicate-implementation counter for the families this
    codebase has repeatedly re-derived (HTTP error envelope, verdict types, durable write).

Each ratchet is its own gate in ``scripts/gate_report.py`` (PHF-11's aggregate), so three
independent structural failures report as THREE failures in one run — one red never hides
the other two.

⚠️  FORBIDDEN-TO-RAISE RULE (the whole point — do not weaken it): when a ratchet reds
    because a counter ROSE, the fix is to FIX THE CODE — split the file, invert the import,
    reuse the existing implementation — NEVER to regenerate this baseline to bless the
    higher number. Regenerating to make a rising count green re-hides exactly the decay this
    file exists to surface. Regeneration is legitimate ONLY when a counter LEGITIMATELY
    SHRANK, and then it must happen in that same commit.

⚠️  SHIP AT THE MEASURED POPULATION, NEVER AT ZERO. This is ``PHF-6``'s own ruling, restated
    here so this atom cannot repeat the outage it warns about: a never-run gate given teeth
    at zero reds the whole tree at once. Every threshold below is derived from a MEASUREMENT of
    the tree as it stands (max 5447 lines, 9 files in the watch band; 66 upward import edges in
    33 files; 33 duplicate sites in 29 files), not an aspiration. The ratchets forbid only
    GROWTH.

⚠️  AND A RATCHET THAT REDS ORDINARY MAINTENANCE IS AN OUTAGE, NOT A GATE. The size ratchet
    counts HOW MANY files are giant; it does not freeze each giant's exact length. Decay is a new
    2,800-line module appearing — not three lines added to the module that, by construction, gets
    maintained most (three of the config round-trip's five points live in
    ``config/loader.py``, the largest file in the repo). A ratchet that turned a boolean config
    toggle into "split a 5,447-line file first" is the gate people route around, which is exactly
    why this file does NOT ratchet function length or cyclomatic complexity either.
    ``test_an_ordinary_config_field_addition_to_the_largest_file_stays_green`` is the rail that
    keeps this true.

⚠️  EVERY THRESHOLD RECORDS ITS RATIONALE — the defect it exists to catch — in the
    ``rationale`` field beside the number, so a future session can tell a load-bearing limit
    from an arbitrary one. ``tests/test_structural_baseline.py`` asserts every threshold has
    one.

# what this deliberately does NOT ratchet
    Stated as decisions, so the omissions read as choices rather than gaps:

    * **``tests/`` file length.** A 3,000-line test module is not the comprehension hazard a
      3,000-line production module is: tests are read one function at a time and grow by
      append, by design. Ratcheting them would tax the one activity we want cheapest.
    * **Function/class length and cyclomatic complexity.** flake8 already owns per-line and
      per-import style; a complexity ratchet needs a metric everyone agrees on, and picking
      one badly produces a gate people route around. Deferred, not rejected.
    * **``web/`` (the SPA).** The design-system ratchets already own frontend structure and
      run under vitest; a second, Python-side counter over ``web/src`` would be a duplicate
      gate — exactly the defect ``structural-duplication`` measures.
    * **The apps → core import direction.** ``tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py`` already
      owns it (apps may reach core only via ``gideon.sdk.*``). This atom deliberately
      picks directions that test does NOT cover: INSIDE core, and the reverse direction
      (core importing its own published facade).
    * **Total line count of ``src/``.** A growing project grows; a total-lines ratchet would
      red on every feature and teach the team to regenerate baselines, which is the habit
      that kills every other ratchet in this file.
    * **Import CYCLES.** Worth having and genuinely separate: a cycle is a different defect
      (initialization order) from a direction violation (layer inversion), and it needs a
      strongly-connected-component pass rather than a per-edge rule. Its own atom.

# how to update
    Regenerate ONLY when a counter LEGITIMATELY SHRANK (a file was split, an upward import
    was inverted, a re-derivation was deleted), and do it in that SAME commit::

        python scripts/generate_structural_baseline.py

    Each such commit should be able to point at the split, the inversion, or the deletion.

# moving SIZE_WATCH_BAND_LINES is a re-authoring, not a regeneration
    The band is a threshold, not a counter, so changing it is not covered by the
    forbidden-to-raise rule — which makes it the one loophole in this file, and it is closed by
    protocol rather than by a rail. The ONLY sanctioned trigger is the cliff rail
    (``test_the_watch_band_is_not_sitting_on_a_cliff``) reporting under 100 lines of headroom,
    which means the boundary has stopped sitting at a gap. When that happens: measure the whole
    distribution, pick the boundary at a real gap, and record the measured table plus the
    reasoning in ``PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS``'s execution log — 2500 -> 2800 on 2026-08-21 is the
    worked example.

    It is FORBIDDEN to move the band in response to a population RISE. That is a counter, the
    forbidden-to-raise rule owns it, and widening the band to make a new giant disappear is the
    same act as regenerating a baseline to bless a higher number. If a red names an entrant, split
    the entrant.

The render is DETERMINISTIC: files, site lists and per-rule totals are all sorted, the
output is ``json.dumps(..., indent=2, sort_keys=True)`` with a trailing newline, and it
carries no timestamps, absolute paths, or line numbers (a line number would churn on every
edit above it). A second run is byte-identical to the first.

# Files at or above this length are the WATCH BAND, and the ratchet counts HOW MANY there are
# (shrink-only) rather than pinning each one's length. The boundary must sit at a real GAP in the
# measured distribution, never at a round number, and this repo proved why within three days of
# the band being authored: ``agents/native/builtin_tools.py`` grew ~233 lines (AG-14 alone added
# 122) to 2467, which left the original 2500 band with **33** lines of headroom — the cliff rail
# caught it, and the band had to move.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-21 over 921 production files. Only two boundaries in the relevant window clear
# the rail's own >= 100 requirement:
#
#     band   population   largest non-member          headroom
#     2400        11       2294  subagent.py              106
#     2500        10       2467  builtin_tools.py          33   <- the cliff that forced this move
#     2600         9       2583  workflows/engine.py       17

#
# 2800 over 2400, and the usual reading of that trade is backwards. The apparent cost is that
# ``engine.py`` (2583) and ``builtin_tools.py`` (2467) are not watched — but a band member's
# growth is deliberately NOT a violation, so at 2400 those two would be GRANDFATHERED and free to
# run to the ceiling unchallenged. At 2800 they are outside, and crossing 2800 REDS. The band at
# 2800 therefore puts MORE pressure on the two fastest-growing large files in the repo, not less.
# On top of that, 2400's 106 lines of headroom is well under one feature's growth for this
# codebase (233 lines in three days, above), so it would be shipping a boundary already known to
# be one merge from redding; 2800 gives 217, 2.17x the rail's floor.
#
# KNOWN COST, stated rather than discovered later: the band's smallest member is
# ``chat_handlers.py`` at 2808, so it has only 8 lines of SHRINK margin — delete nine lines from
# it and the stale-high check asks for a regeneration. That is deliberate. The 225-line gap
# (2583 -> 2808) cannot give 200+ lines of margin in both directions, and the two remedies are not
# equally priced: a stale-high red is one command (re-run this generator) in the same commit and is
# the documented, sanctioned flow for a file leaving the giant population, whereas a cliff red asks
# for the boundary itself to be re-authored. Optimise the
# margin against GROWTH, which is the direction this ratchet exists to measure, and pay the cheap
# remedy on the other side.

# difference between a ratchet and an outage. ``config/loader.py`` is the ceiling holder AND the
# file the config round-trip contract touches on every new field (dataclass + ``_meta`` +

# that file ZERO headroom, so a one-line boolean toggle would red CI and demand a 5,447-line
# split as its price. The rail's job is to stop a STEP CHANGE — a module arriving at 6,000 lines,
# or the worst file gaining a thousand — and the watch-band population already catches every new
