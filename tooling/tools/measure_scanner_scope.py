"""Re-measure ``SkillScanner`` over a checkout of app bundles.

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=src:. python tools/measure_scanner_scope.py /path/to/GideonApps

Prints, per bundle: the verdict, the finding count, how many findings are DANGEROUS, and
then every DANGEROUS-band match the execution-reachability pass had an opinion about with
the clause that decided it (see ``supply_chain.py``'s reachability section for L1-L5).

This is the "one command per bundle" re-validation #2526 asked for: a bundle's
installability is a number a reviewer reads off rather than takes on trust, and a
reachability downgrade always names the clauses that granted it, so a downgrade nobody
can check is not possible.

Read-only. Scans a checkout in place and writes nothing.
