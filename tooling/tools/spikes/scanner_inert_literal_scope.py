"""SPIKE — PROPOSAL, NOT A LANDING. Scope a DANGEROUS match by what it can reach.

The question this exists to answer
----------------------------------
``SkillScanner``'s DANGEROUS band matches a *string shape* and is blind to whether that
string is ever executed. So a bundle whose test fixture contains a literal attack string
— the string that proves its input validation refuses the attack — is judged identically
to a bundle that runs that string. DANGEROUS is terminal and non-consentable, so the
fixture permanently blocks the install.

This module computes an independent, conservative answer to a narrower question: *can
this matched literal be executed at all, anywhere in this bundle?* When the answer is a
provable no, it re-scores that one finding from DANGEROUS to WARNING and records why.

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
* It does not import, patch, wrap, or alter ``gideon.supply_chain``. The shipped
  scanner is untouched; there is no default-on path and nothing to disable.
* It never raises a severity, never removes a finding, and never lowers a verdict below
  WARNING. Disclosure is preserved in full: the user still sees the finding, the rule id,
  the file and the evidence, and still has to consent.
* It refuses to answer rather than guess. Every predicate below is default-deny: an
  unparseable file, an import graph that runtime can bend, or an execution site whose
  program name is not statically known all mean "no downgrade".

The rule, and why each clause is load-bearing
---------------------------------------------
A DANGEROUS finding is re-scored iff ALL of the following hold. Each clause closes one
route from "a string sits in a file" to "a command ran".

L1  LITERAL, NOT CODE. The file parses as Python and the matched span lies wholly inside
    a ``str`` constant. A shell script has no data positions — its text *is* the program —
    so a ``.sh`` finding is never eligible. This is the clause that makes the whole idea
    honest: it is decided on the AST, not on a filename, so calling a file
    ``test_evil.py`` buys an attacker exactly nothing.

L2  NO LOCAL EXECUTION PATH. The file itself cannot hand a string to an interpreter: no
    ``os.system``/``popen``/``exec*``/``spawn*``/``pty``, no ``eval``/``exec``/``compile``,
    no ``subprocess`` call whose ``shell`` is anything but a literal ``False``, and every
    spawn site's argv[0] is a literal program name that is neither a shell nor an
    interpreter nor a path (so it cannot be a script shipped in the bundle).

L3  NO EXPORT. Nothing else in the bundle can lift the literal out: no other module
    imports it, no other file mentions its filename or module stem as a string (which is
    how a payload would be read rather than imported), and ``app.json`` does not name it
    as an entry point.

L4  THE GRAPH IS TRUSTWORTHY. L3 is a static claim, so it is void if the bundle can
    rewrite its own import graph at runtime. Any ``eval``/``exec``/``compile``/
    ``__import__``/``importlib``/``runpy``/``pickle``/``marshal``/``ctypes``, any
    ``getattr`` with a computed name, any ``import *``, or any ``sys.path`` mutation
    ANYWHERE in the bundle revokes the downgrade for the whole bundle.

L5  IMPORTING IT IS A NO-OP. Unreachable is not the same as never-imported — a test
    runner, or a curious user, may import the module. Its top level must therefore
    contain no call outside a small pure allowlist, so the payload cannot fire on import.

Residual risk a reviewer must weigh (stated, not hidden)
--------------------------------------------------------
* A bundle can ship a module that is pure inert data, referenced by nothing, and get its
  literal disclosed-and-consentable instead of refused. That is a real reduction in the
  floor for that one shape. Measured counterweight: the shipped DANGEROUS band already
  scores ``"rm -" + "rf /"`` as CLEAN and ``os.system("rm -rf /")`` as WARNING, so the
  band never held against an attacker who was trying. See the spike's test suite.
* L2 assumes a pinned, non-shell, non-interpreter argv[0] cannot be talked into running a
  shell by its arguments. ``git -c core.pager=…`` is a counterexample in principle. The
  tighter alternative — require every argv element to be a literal — is one line here and
  is what a reviewer should consider if that residual is judged too wide.
