"""Generate roadmap-dashboard.html — one self-contained page for owner visibility.

Design goal (owner ask, 2026-08-05, refined 2026-08-06): LOW COGNITIVE LOAD. The default
view is ~one screen and answers three questions with no scrolling:

  1. How much is done?    — a hero band: plans-done % AND atoms-done %, each a stacked
                            status bar over the states in `DAG_STATES`, with counts.
  2. What's happening now? — the live execution stack + next-up queue (from
                            `.roadmap-exec-state.json`), with branch + PR links.
  3. Where does the work live? — a compact pillar grid, one tile per plan, click to drill in.

And, since 2026-09-07, a fourth question the first three could not answer: WHY is an atom
not moving? Everything not done, not in progress and not on the ready frontier used to
render as one grey `blocked` bucket — dozens of atoms mixing "the owner can sign this off
today" with "needs a second machine nobody here has" with "waiting its turn behind another
atom". Those want different reactions from different people, so the stuck half is split by
CAUSE (`owner` / `environment` / `waiting`) with an `unclassified` state for atoms the rules
cannot place. See `DAG_STATES` for the vocabulary and `AtomClassifier` for the precedence.

How MANY are in each is deliberately not written down anywhere in this file: run it and read
the summary line. That population turns over daily — the same query returned 37 at main
`281d693b1` and 34 three commits later at `50b3671e3`, because CE-10, EI-6 and PEP-16
flipped to done — so any number pinned in prose here would be wrong by the next tick.

Everything heavier — per-plan atom lists, dependency tiers, the full execution-order prose,
the engine session queue — lives inside `<details>` elements that are CLOSED by default.
No JS framework: native `<details>/<summary>` plus a tiny expand/collapse-all helper.

Derives ENTIRELY from files already maintained as the source of truth, so it never drifts:
  * docs/roadmap/atomic/dag.json  — the atom catalog + the authoritative DAG:
                                    ready_frontier, gated_frontier, cycles, dangling,
                                    unresolved, resolved_edges. The backbone: every count
                                    and colour comes from here, computed at run time.
                                    Sizes belong in the output, not in this docstring —
                                    this line read "602 atoms" for months while the file
                                    grew to 684 (measured at 50b3671e3, 2026-09-07), and a
                                    stale number is most dangerous in the file that
                                    computes the real one.
  * docs/roadmap/roadmap.md       — the Plans-by-Pillar tables (pillar grouping, names, waves)
  * docs/roadmap/plans/*.md       — each plan's **Status:** line (shown inside a drilled tile)
  * workspace ROADMAP.md §5       — the full execution-order prose (collapsed)
  * workspace .roadmap-exec-state.json — the live "working now" stack + next_up
  * docs/roadmap/WF2-SESSION-QUEUE.md  — engine session tallies (collapsed)
  * git + gh                      — open-PR lookup for working-now branch links (best-effort)

# else was a single grey `blocked` — every stuck atom in one bar, and the owner could not see
# which of them were HIS. They are three unrelated situations — a sign-off, repo, release or
# money-spending live run only the owner can do; a machine, OS grant, live account or price
# row this environment lacks; or plain dependency ordering behind another atom — so they get
# three states. `unclassified` is the seventh, and deliberate: an atom the rules cannot place
# must be VISIBLE, because a guessed classification is worse than the grey bucket it replaced

    Built once per run by `classifier_for` from the dag block, because three of the rules
    need graph-wide facts (the two frontiers, and every other atom's status).

    The precedence, highest first:

    0. `status` is `done` / `in_progress` — the atom itself settles it; it IS moving.
    1. on `gated_frontier` with `"owner"` in its gate array → **owner**. Deps are all met;
       the only thing left is an owner act. This outranks the gate's other tokens: AR-1 is
       gated `["ext", "owner"]` and it is the owner's ruling that unsticks it.
    2. on `gated_frontier` with no `"owner"` gate (e.g. `["ext"]`) → **environment**.
    3. on `ready_frontier` → **ready**.
    4. `status` is `blocked` → read `blocked_reason`, case-insensitively:
       a. an ENVIRONMENT-GATED marker → **environment**. Checked BEFORE the owner markers
          because an environment reason often also cites the owner ruling that scoped it
          (PCS-9: "ENVIRONMENT-GATED (owner ruling 2026-08-28 split this from …)") and the
          explicit marker is the atom's own answer to this exact question.
       b. an OWNER-GATED / OWNER-ONLY / OWNER-RESIDUAL marker → **owner**.
       c. a core decision issue, or another unfinished atom, named as the blocker →
          **waiting**.
       d. an owner act named as the blocker in prose → **owner**.
       e. otherwise → **unclassified**, and the page says so out loud.
    5. `status` is `todo` and it is on neither frontier → **waiting**: something in its dep
       closure is unfinished, which is exactly why the deriver left it off both frontiers.
       A marker in such an atom's reason describes the gate it will hit LATER, not what is
       stopping it now (DL-10 is OWNER-ONLY, but what it waits on is DL-11).
    6. anything else → **unclassified**.

    hand-written block this replaced had exactly that bug latent — `.st-*` set four fills,
    while the ink for the grey one lived in two unrelated overrides (`.statbar i.st-blocked`,
    `.atomchip.st-blocked`) that any new state was guaranteed to miss, inheriting near-black
    text on whatever fill it chose.

    Selectors are scoped to the elements that actually wear a state (segment, chip, dot,
    swatch, tile edge) rather than a bare `.st-*`, because `.tile` and `.atom` carry the
    state class too: a bare `.st-owner { background; color }` would repaint a whole plan tile
    pink and set its text near-black on dark. Each is >= 2 classes, so it wins by specificity
