"""Census: which ``todo`` atoms in ``docs/roadmap/atomic/dag.json`` are already on ``main``?

Why this exists
---------------
An atom's ``status`` in ``dag.json`` is authored by hand and flipped by hand at integration
time. Two mechanical facts make it drift *systematically* in one direction — atoms stay
``todo`` after their code has landed:

* The merge train **cherry-picks per commit**, so a PR can read ``CLOSED`` with
  ``mergedAt: null`` while its content sits on ``main``. **PR state is not evidence.**
* ``git cherry origin/main <branch>`` prints ``+`` (unmerged) for a commit whose content
  landed via cherry-pick or squash. **``git cherry`` is not evidence either.**

So the only reliable questions are: *does the atom's own named deliverable exist on the
ref?* and *does the plan's execution log already say the work is complete?* Five atoms
(``DCU-2``, ``PHF-7``, ``DFE-2``, ``PCS-7``, ``MRT-5``) were each found this way by
accident, one wasted roadmap tick at a time. This tool does it for all of them at once.

    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py                  # the four-bucket census
    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py --bucket clean   # just the flippable ones
    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py --atom DCU-2 -v  # one atom, with its keys
    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py --branches       # + the stranded-branch scan
    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py --json           # machine-readable

    # DESTRUCTIVE, opt-in: is each landed wire actually ASSERTED by anything?
    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py --check-wires APE-3
    python3 tools/audit_landed_atoms.py --check-wires        # the LANDED-AND-CLEAN bucket

It **never** edits the roadmap. ``dag.json`` is owner-maintained; flips happen at
integration. Exit status is ``0`` for any census, however imperfect the roadmap looks, and
non-zero **only** when one of the tool's own vacuity assertions fails (see ``self_check``) or
a wire check cannot restore the tree it mutated (exit ``3``).

A LANDED-AND-CLEAN verdict is a claim about **presence**, and presence is not the same as
being load-bearing. ``--check-wires`` closes that gap by neutralising the atom's production
call statements and re-running a bounded selection; see "wire check" below. It is deliberately
never part of a default run — it writes to ``src/`` and it costs minutes.

The three shapes of evidence
----------------------------
``deliverable evidence`` — keys are extracted from the atom's own ``title``/``scope``/
``done_when`` (module paths, snake_case symbols, CamelCase types, ``make`` targets, env
vars) and looked up in a corpus built from the ref's tree. The corpus **deliberately
excludes ``docs/``**: the plan text that the keys came from lives there, so including it
would make every atom look landed. That is the central false-positive trap.

``log verdict`` — the owning plan's ``## Execution log`` is split into entries, each entry
classified into a small closed set (``LogVerdict``), and each attributed to the atom ids it
names. Only the atom's **own** plan adjudicates it, and an id in an entry's headline
outranks one buried in a body. Precedence is **last entry wins by file position**, because
these logs are append-ordered and later entries supersede earlier ones (``PHF-7`` is logged
PARTIAL at one point and "all five clauses now MET" further down the same file).

``code caveat`` — not every finding lands in the plan log. The repo also records "shipped
but nothing calls it" as a ratchet test or a module comment, which a log scanner cannot see.
``DCU-2`` is the measured case: its log says "COMPLETE (all three clauses); flip it when the
PR lands", while ``tests/test_computer_use_call_sites.py`` on ``main`` — committed *after*
that entry — proves its three screens have zero production callers. This signal is
**one-directional**: it can only move an atom OUT of LANDED-AND-CLEAN, never into it.

Bucketing is the conjunction of these, and it is deliberately conservative:

===================  =====================================================================
LANDED-AND-CLEAN     deliverable on the ref **and** the log says complete-but-unmerged
LANDED-BUT-GATED     deliverable on the ref **but** the log names a gate (owner call,
                     unmet clause, unbuilt scope, a control with no production caller)
NOT LANDED           no deliverable evidence on the ref
UNDECIDABLE CHEAPLY  the two signals disagree, or one is missing. Reported as unknown on
                     purpose: a wrong "landed" claim costs more than an honest gap.
===================  =====================================================================

Precision, stated up front: this is a grep. It cannot read a ``done_when``. It answers
"is the named thing there and does the log already say so", which is exactly the signal
the five known misses would have needed — and nothing more. ``--verify-known`` scores it
against those five.

What the wire check cannot see
------------------------------
Stated here rather than discovered later. The locator is AST over the atom's deliverable
modules, so it is blind to:

* **dynamic dispatch** — ``getattr(mod, name)()``, a registry/dict of handlers, a callback
  passed as a value, ``functools.partial``, anything invoked through ``__call__``.
* **decorators and framework registration** — a route, a hook, an event subscriber or a CLI
  command whose "caller" is a decorator at import time. There is no call statement to delete.
* **re-exports and indirection** — a symbol reached through ``__init__``'s ``from .x import y``
  is resolved to the re-exporting module, not the defining one, so its wires split across two
  names. A wrapper module that forwards under a different name is a different symbol.
* **methods** — resolution is module-level functions only. ``self.foo()`` and ``obj.foo()``
  need the receiver's type, which is beyond an AST pass.
* **value-consuming calls** — ``x = f()``, ``if f():``, ``return f()``. Out of scope on
  purpose: neutralising them measures a NameError cascade, not the wire.
* **rails that live outside the derived selection** — a green is bounded by the files chosen,
  and the report prints how many it did not run. It never means "the suite catches this".
* **cross-repo consumers** — ``GideonApps`` and the ``web/`` frontend are not run.

Consequences: an UNRAILED verdict on a wire of one of those shapes may be a false positive
(the caller might be reached another way), while an UNRAILED verdict on a plain side-effect
call statement is a measurement. RAILED is the stronger direction — a red is a red.

    Loud because the returned note is printed: "audited the landed tree" and "audited this

    "Named in the headline" is not the same as "is the subject", and the difference is a whole
    class of mis-attribution. Measured on ``origin/main``: ``DCU-3`` was reported
    LANDED-BUT-GATED off ``- **2026-08-24 — `DCU-4` DONE (…) except the one clause that needs
    `DCU-3`.**`` — its id sits in that headline, but as the dependency the *other* atom is
    blocked on. ``DCU-3``'s own deliverables (``macos_driver.py``, ``macos_ffi.py``) are not on
    the ref at all. Same shape for ``ES-7`` in the ``[harvest]`` entry's headline.

    So the subject is a single id: the FIRST id in the headline, **backticked or bare**. These
    entries are written subject-first — "``DCU-4`` DONE … except …", "``ES-5`` … and ``ES-7`` …
    landed PARTIAL for want of", "``- [2026-08-23][ES-7]``" — and the bare form is not optional:
    ``CA-7``'s own ruling opens "**CA-7 PARTIAL — the atom stays ``todo``**" with no backticks,
    then backticks ``CA-6`` two lines down, still inside the headline window. Reading only
    backticks handed that entry to ``CA-6`` and left ``CA-7`` with no verdict of its own. A bare
    token that is not an atom at all (``RFC-2119``, ``SEV-2``) resolves to an id no catalog
    contains, so it attributes to nobody — the failure mode is inert.

    What that gives up: an entry that genuinely rules on two atoms at once ("``ES-5`` and
    ``ES-7`` both DONE") demotes the second to cross-reference. That is the safe direction —
    a cross-reference cannot produce a verdict at all (see ``decide_log``), so the atom lands
    in UNDECIDABLE-CHEAPLY rather than in the just-flip-it bucket on a neighbour's say-so.

    """Classify one log entry. **A negation, a gate or an unmet clause beats a flip phrase.**

    FLIP is tested LAST among the "not done" signals, and that ordering is the whole point.
    An entry routinely carries a flip phrase *and* a reason not to flip — because it quotes
    the entry it is overturning, or because two of three clauses landed. Testing FLIP first
    short-circuited on the flip phrase and put the atom in LANDED-AND-CLEAN, the just-flip-it
    bucket. Measured on ``origin/main`` at ``fc597af4``: ``MRT-5`` was the census's ONE
    actionable recommendation while its own printed excerpt said "must NOT be flipped ``done``
    yet".

    The costs are asymmetric and that asymmetry is the argument: a false FLIP writes ``done``
    onto inert code, the roadmap then claims shipped work that does not work, and nothing
    downstream re-checks it. A false PARTIAL costs one re-audit.

    Two signals overturn a flip phrase, and they are scoped differently on purpose:

    * ``NEGATION_PATTERNS`` win **anywhere in the entry**. The set is narrow and it names the
      flip act itself, so a match is a deliberate refusal wherever it sits.
    * ``GATED``/``PARTIAL`` win only from the **headline** — the same first ``HEADLINE`` chars
      that ``scan_plan_logs`` already treats as where an entry states its subject. These are
      weak keyword sets, and letting them win from the body was measured to be wrong:
      ``PCS-7``'s entry declares "the numbers ship AND soul guardrail 4 is measured … flip it
      when the PR lands" in its headline, then 6810 chars later mentions "see ``G8``'s
      honest-**unmeasured** work" about a different surface it explicitly left alone. Blanket
      inversion scored that as PARTIAL and tripped the ``KNOWN_LANDED`` ground-truth rail. So
      the doctrine is the one this module already uses for ids: **a ruling in the headline
      outranks a keyword in the body.**

    A body keyword is additionally read **per clause**, and a clause carrying a
    ``DEFERRAL_PATTERNS`` marker is dropped: "worth an owner call later" names work declined
    for now, not a gate on this atom. Same errors-in-both-directions root cause, and the
    reason it matters even when the bucket is unchanged is already written down at
    ``decide_log``: a bucket that is right for a reason that is false is worse than no reason.

    GATED-vs-PARTIAL order is left as it was: ``classify`` maps both to the same bucket
    (``GATED`` with evidence, ``OPEN`` without), so their relative order changes only the
    ``why`` label, never a human's decision.

    Two precedence rules used to coexist here with no stated order — *subject beats
    cross-reference* and *last entry wins* — and they can disagree by 150 lines. The order is:
    **subject is a precondition, last-wins only orders within it.** A cross-reference is not a
    late ruling to be weighed against an early one; it is not a ruling at all, so there is
    nothing to order it against. An atom with no entry of its own reports ``NO_SIGNAL``.

    Why that is the safe direction rather than the lax one: ``NO_SIGNAL`` can never reach
    LANDED-AND-CLEAN. ``classify`` puts it in UNDECIDABLE-CHEAPLY with evidence and NOT-LANDED
    without, because CLEAN requires a ``FLIP`` and a ``FLIP`` requires a subject entry. So
    dropping inherited verdicts cannot manufacture a false "just flip it" — it can only convert
    a **false reason** into an honest gap, which is the trade this module already states at
    ``score_evidence`` and in the module docstring.

    Measured, all three off a sibling's entry in their own plan: ``DCU-3``
    (``macos_driver.py``/``macos_ffi.py`` absent from the ref) inherited ``DCU-4``'s gate;
    ``EI-2`` (``sandbox_providers/`` holds only ``base``/``none``/``registry``) inherited
    ``EI-8``'s STOP POINT; ``LV-7`` inherited a ``run_matrix`` DISCOVERY entry. All three read
    LANDED-BUT-GATED — the *landed* half asserted on someone else's paperwork.

    Plan logs are append-ordered, so a later entry supersedes an earlier one even when both
    carry the same date. ``PHF-7`` is exactly this: logged PARTIAL, then "all five clauses
    now MET ... flip it when this PR lands" further down the same file on the same day.

    Only the atom's **own** plan adjudicates it. A foreign plan naming the atom is making a
    dependency remark, not a ruling. Measured: ``CRE-7``, ``LMMV-7`` and ``WF2AUT-12`` were
    each reported gated by a *frontier survey* entry in ``WORKFLOWS-V2-KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS``
    that merely listed them, and ``EI-7``/``WF2WOR-12`` inherited ``PHF-2``'s PARTIAL. The

    than no reason at all.

    """Partition inertness notes into (live, refuted-by-the-ref).

    The caveat scan is a text scanner, so it reads **comments**, and a comment about inertness
    outlives the inertness. Measured on ``origin/main``: ``DCU-2`` stayed LANDED-BUT-GATED on
    three notes that are all past-tense narrative written *after* the gap closed —
    ``computer_use/service.py`` ("``DCU-2`` **shipped** steps 2/4/5 as three … provably inert
    functions"), which is ``DCU-4``'s module and says eight lines later "**and this module is
    that caller**"; ``tests/test_computer_use_call_sites.py`` ("**had** ZERO production callers
    … **``DCU-4`` landed, so the census flipped** from 'nobody calls these' to 'exactly this
    calls these'"); and ``tests/test_audit_landed_atoms.py``, which quotes the case as a
    fixture. A one-directional signal with no expiry pins the fixed atom forever.

    So the note is **falsified against the ref**, not scoped by its prose. An inertness note
    asserts one checkable fact — *nothing calls this* — and a call-shaped use of the atom's own
    named symbol in an impl file is that fact's counter-example. Tense-sniffing was rejected
    because it fixes two of DCU-2's three notes and leaves the present-tense one pinning it;
    "the note must sit in the atom's own module" was rejected because the founding case is a
    ratchet under ``tests/``; and "drop it if the note's file calls the symbols" was rejected on
    measurement — ``test_computer_use_call_sites.py`` itself calls all three (4/1/1 hits), so it
    would have deleted the very signal the mechanism exists for.

    What it gives up, plainly:

    * the atom needs at least one ``symbol`` key — a path-only atom can never be refuted, so
      its note stands (conservative);
    * a **dynamic** caller (registry, decorator, ``self.foo()``) leaves no call-shaped text, so
      the note stands (conservative — the same blind spot ``--check-wires`` documents);
    * a **generic** symbol name can be refuted by an unrelated function of the same name in
      another package. This is the one lax direction, it is the same generic-name hazard
      ``score_evidence`` already prints for SYMBOL-ONLY evidence, and it is why the refuting
      ``file calls sym()`` is printed in the ``why`` rather than silently swallowed.

    The note's **own** file counts as a refuting caller, and that is deliberate rather than an
    oversight: DCU-2's measured case is a note whose own module became the caller — the same
    docstring says "``gate`` is a separate step *a caller must remember* — **and this module is
    that caller**" eight lines below the sentence that pins it. Excluding it does not protect
    the founding case either, because ``tests/`` is not in ``IMPL_PREFIXES``, so a ratchet under
    ``tests/`` can never be its own refuter no matter what it calls.

    Definitions are excluded: ``def check_app(`` is call-shaped text and the defining module is
    never its own caller. Only ``found_impl`` is searched, so the whole check costs a handful of
    regex scans over files ``probe`` already located, not a second pass over the corpus.

# The census above asks "is the atom's named deliverable on the ref, and does the log say so".
# That question is one level too shallow, and ``APE-3`` is the measured proof: the census
# scored it LANDED-AND-CLEAN, a deep audit confirmed all five done_when clauses hold
# behaviourally — and then found that deleting ``start_worker_watchdog()`` from
# ``providers/loader.py::load_all_extensions`` **and** ``_stop_worker(name)`` from both
# ``app_manager.disable`` and ``app_manager.force_uninstall`` left **116 tests green** across
# test_app_worker_runtime, test_app_background_contract, test_app_manager_lifecycle,
# test_app_manager_update, test_apps_import_boundary, test_spawn_ceiling_audit,
# test_spawn_hazard_audit and test_inert_surface_baseline.
#
# The importers existed. They were named. Nothing asserted them. A wire that exists but is
# asserted by nothing is one refactor away from a wire that does not exist, and the census
# called that CLEAN. So the check here is not "is there a production caller?" but "would the
# suite notice if the caller went away?" — answered the only way it can be answered honestly:
# neutralise the call, run a bounded selection, observe.
#
# This is destructive and slow, so it is strictly opt-in (``--check-wires``) and never part of
# a default census run. Everything below is built around three properties:
#
#   never leave a mutated tree   file-copy snapshot + hash-verified restore, wired to atexit
#                                AND to SIGINT/SIGTERM. ``git checkout -- <file>`` is never
#                                used: it would also revert a sibling's unrelated edit.
#   bounded                      a derived, capped, per-wire selection — never ``make test``.
#                                What was NOT run is reported, because a green from a narrow
#                                selection is exactly the false comfort this check removes.
#   refuse rather than guess     a dirty target file, an unparseable module, a call site that
#                                is not uniquely locatable, an empty selection, a red or
#                                empty baseline, a mutation that does not verify, or a

    WORKERS``). It matters because an atom's prose frequently does NOT name the symbol
    that carries its done_when — ``APE-3`` says "survives a crash (watchdog)" and never
    writes ``start_worker_watchdog``, so key extraction alone cannot reach the wire.
