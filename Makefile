## test-e2e: run the BROWSER gate against an isolated gateway (axe-per-route a11y, PWA,
## visual regression, one real end-to-end chat turn). Deliberately NOT part of `make test`:
## a bare pytest must stay a fast, offline, browser-free unit run, and this needs a built SPA
## plus a booted gateway.
##
## Offline and credential-free by construction, which is the property worth stating: playwright's
## own webServer boots the gateway with GIDEON_HOME under $$TMPDIR (never a real home), so
## nothing here can touch a user's state. The gateway DOES have a model — the SCRIPTED provider
## (src/gideon/llm/scripted.py), bound as the only providers[] entry and pinned as chat's
## active model, which is what lets e2e/chat.spec.ts complete a real turn instead of every spec
## carefully avoiding one. That changes neither property: the scripted provider is deterministic,
## makes ZERO network calls and needs NO credential, and it refuses to construct unless
## GIDEON_SCRIPTED_MODEL_SCRIPT names a script file, so it is inert everywhere the harness
## has not explicitly opted in. So: still offline, still credential-free, and now also model-bound.
## Readiness is the GIDEON_READY line, not a port probe, so the run cannot proceed
## against a bound-but-unauthenticated gateway.
##
## One-time per machine: `npm ci` (from the REPO ROOT — never inside web/, see web-build) and
## `npx playwright install chromium`. No spec list here on purpose: a new spec joins the gate the
## moment it lands.
## Screenshot assertions are IGNORED here, deliberately, and `test-visual` below owns them.
## Measured on an untouched `main` checkout in this Darwin dev environment: e2e/visual.spec.ts is
## 28 failed / 11 passed. The baselines are platform-qualified (see snapshotPathTemplate) and have
## drifted from what this machine renders, which is a real thing to fix but has nothing to do with
## whether the app is accessible, installable or functional. Folding an always-red suite into the
## default browser gate would make the gate mean nothing — the failure mode every rail in this repo
## is written to avoid.
##
## MEASURED OFFLINE AND CREDENTIAL-FREE (PHF-7's last clause), Darwin dev machine, 2026-08-26:
## 484 passed / 8 skipped / 0 failed, 7.8m of Playwright time, 469s wall clock including `npm run
## build` and both webServer boots. Run with HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/ALL_PROXY pointed at the closed
## port 127.0.0.1:1 and NO_PROXY=localhost (localhost MUST stay exempt or the harness cannot reach
## the gateway it just started), and with every provider credential unset from the environment.
## Egress was DENIED, not merely unused — which is the distinction that makes the number mean
## something. The gateway's update checker reached for `git fetch` and was refused 537 times over
## the run, and the gate stayed green anyway. A run where nothing had tried would have proved
## nothing about being offline; this one proves the app degrades rather than depends.
test-e2e:
	cd $(WEB_DIR) && npx playwright test --project=chromium --ignore-snapshots

## test-visual: the visual-regression suite with screenshot assertions ENFORCED. Split out of
## test-e2e because its baselines are environment-sensitive (28/39 red on a clean main checkout on
## this dev machine) — run it when you intend to inspect or refresh them (`-u` updates), not as a
## precondition for every other browser check.
test-visual:
	cd $(WEB_DIR) && npx playwright test e2e/visual.spec.ts --project=chromium

## harness-validate: shape-validate + reference-resolve the self-dev harness specs
harness-validate:
	$(PYTHON) -m harness validate

## gates: run the platform-hardening drift/inert/structural gates (config-baseline,
## inert-surface, docs-lint, structural-size, structural-import-direction,
## structural-duplication) and print ONE aggregate table — every failure in a single run
## (never short-circuits). Exit 0 iff all gates pass. Each gate also has its own pytest
## ratchet, and every baseline is shrink-only and FORBIDDEN to raise.

# ── Bare local dev servers (no container runtime, no desktop bundle) ───────────

## serve: run ONE gateway process that serves both the API and the built SPA on
## DEV_PORT (default 10000). Requires a built web/dist (run `make web-build` once,
## or `make serve-fresh`). Binds to the local network (0.0.0.0) and SKIPS token
## auth for local-network clients (loopback + RFC1918/link-local/ULA) via
## GIDEON_BYPASS_LOCAL_NETWORKS=1 — so any device on the dev LAN reaches the
## dashboard with no token. (This is the IP-gated bypass, NOT AUTH_MODE=none,
## which would force loopback-only; public/non-private origins still need a token.)
serve:
	GIDEON_HOME=$(DEV_HOME) GIDEON_WORKSPACE=$(DEV_HOME)/workspace \
		GIDEON_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
		GIDEON_BYPASS_LOCAL_NETWORKS=1 \
		$(VENV)/gideon gateway --no-open --port $(DEV_PORT) --json-ready

## serve-fresh: build the SPA, then `serve` (use after frontend changes).
serve-fresh: web-build serve

## serve-web: Vite dev server (HMR) on :3000, proxying /api + /ws to the gateway
## on DEV_PORT. Run `make serve` in another shell first. Best for frontend
## iteration; the gateway is the API/backend.
serve-web:
	cd $(WEB_DIR) && GIDEON_PORT=$(DEV_PORT) npm run dev

# ── Web app & PyInstaller bundle ───────────────────────────────────────────────

## web-build: compile the React SPA (web) into dist/ + link static/dist -> web/dist
##
## static/dist is a SYMLINK, not a copy: the gateway serves from
## $(PKG)/static/dist (dashboard/handlers/core.py _DIST_DIR) while Vite builds to
## $(WEB_DIR)/dist. Linking (not copying) keeps them a single source of truth so a
## later `npm run build` is live immediately — matching what the runtime resolver
## frontend.ensure_dev_dist_symlink() creates. A `cp -R` here would leave a frozen
## real directory that shadows the runtime symlink and silently serves a stale SPA.
# Install + build from the WORKSPACE ROOT (never `cd web`): the root package.json
# owns the npm workspace (web, desktop) and its single package-lock.json. Running
# npm inside a workspace member trips npm's optional-dependency bug (npm/cli#4828)
# and skips platform-native binaries (rollup/esbuild/lightningcss) → a broken build.
web-build:

	npm run build --workspace $(WEB_DIR)
	mkdir -p $(PKG)/static
	rm -rf $(PKG)/static/dist

## desktop-dist: build a signed .dmg in desktop/dist/
desktop-dist: desktop
	cd $(DESKTOP_DIR) && npm run dist

## desktop-dist-linux: build the UNSIGNED Linux AppImage + .deb in desktop/dist/ (DC-6).
## Run on a Linux host — release.yml's `desktop-linux` job is the canonical caller.
## No signing step by design: Linux has no OS-level code-signing gate (nothing
## analogous to Gatekeeper consumes a signature) — see docs/guides/desktop.md.
