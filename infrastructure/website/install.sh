# Gideon bootstrap installer — the `curl -fsSL https://gideon.dev/install | sh` one-liner.
#
# Plan 34 (DISTRIBUTION) §E / T2.2. THIS FILE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the bytes
# served at https://gideon.dev/install. It is staged here — rather than living only
# in the website repo (gideon.dev, plan 36 owns) — because the rail below is here.
# The website repo's public/install is a MIRROR: re-apply it whenever this file changes,
# and update install.sh.sha256 in the same commit (deploy/website/README.md §1).
#
# What CI actually does with this file. Every claim in this block is asserted by
# tests/test_website_installer.py, which reds if the job it names stops existing or
# stops naming this file — an earlier version of this header advertised a weekly
# full.yml smoke that had never been written, and nothing noticed:
#   · ci.yml   `lint`          shellcheck -s sh + sh -n + dash -n on this file (every PR)
#   · ci.yml   `test`          offline contract: --help / --container / unknown-arg, the
#                              truncation-safe structure, staged-vs-pinned digest
#   · full.yml `install-smoke` runs BOTH this file AND the bytes actually served at
#                              /install, in a bare ubuntu container (push to main +
#                              nightly), and reds when the two disagree. A fetch that
#                              fails reports `unproven` and reds; it never goes green.
#
# What it does (idempotent — re-running upgrades):
#   1. `--container` → print the Docker Compose snippet and exit (no install).
#   2. Ensure `uv` is present (installs via the official installer if missing).
#   3. `uv tool install --upgrade gideon>=$PC_MIN_VERSION` (uv brings its own Python
#      3.12). The floor bounds a downgrade attack without giving up --upgrade — see
#      PC_MIN_VERSION below for why it lags the current release by one.
#   4. Print next steps and offer to run `gideon setup`.
#
# POSIX sh only (no bashisms) so it runs under dash/ash/sh on Linux + macOS.

# Downgrade floor for the PyPI install below, and it is deliberately the PREVIOUS release
# rather than the version this tree builds.
#
# WHAT IT BUYS. `--upgrade` already resolves to the newest release, so on an honest index the
# floor forbids nothing (measured 2026-09-07, uv 0.12.5: `>=0.1.2` + `--upgrade` installs
# 0.1.3). Its whole job is the dishonest case: a rolled-back or yanked-and-replaced index
# that offers only old code. Unfloored, that installs silently — measured `+ gideon==
# 0.1.0`, exit 0. Floored, uv exits 1 with "unsatisfiable". Loud beats quiet.
#
# WHY NOT THE CURRENT VERSION. A floor equal to pyproject's version is unsatisfiable for as
# long as it takes that release to reach PyPI and its mirrors — measured, `>=0.1.4` exits 1
# today with "only gideon<=0.1.3 is available". That window would break every install
# AND full.yml's `install-smoke`, which runs this file for real on every push to main. One
# release behind has always shipped already, so the floor can never demand a version that
# does not exist yet. The cost is one unguarded step: a rollback to the immediately-previous
# release still installs, which is the attacker's weakest move anyway.
#
# WHY IT CANNOT ROT. A hand-typed version in a shell script is the defect in #2554 (two
# copies drifted three weeks). tests/test_website_installer.py pins this constant to
# CHANGELOG.md's second-newest release heading, so it reds the release after it goes stale.
