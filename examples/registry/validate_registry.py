"""PR validation for the Gideon community app registry (``app-registry.json``).

CI runs this on every pull request that touches ``app-registry.json``. It answers one
question per changed listing row — **may this app be listed?** — and records the
answer, with its reason, where a reviewer reads it.

The four checks the front-door policy promises (``CONTRIBUTING.md``):

1. **repo liveness** — ``git ls-remote`` reaches the repo and it has a branch.
2. **manifest fetch + parse** — a shallow clone must carry an ``app.json`` that
   ``gideon.apps.manifest.AppManifest`` parses AND validates. The row's
   ``types`` and ``permissions_declared`` must match what that manifest actually
   declares, because those two fields are the pre-install consent surface the
   registry publishes on the user's behalf.
3. **license present** — a license file in the repo, a ``license`` in the
   manifest, and the row agreeing with the manifest.
4. **scanner dry-run** — ``SkillScanner`` over the clone at the ``community``
   trust tier. The verdict is recorded on every row, always. ``dangerous``
   BLOCKS the listing; ``warning`` and ``low`` are DISPLAYED and never block.
   "Dry-run" is literal: the scanner is static content inspection and this script
   never executes a single line of the fetched repo.

Alongside the four checks, each row's **signer identity** (``signer``) is recorded and
echoed in the verdict. That is a *claim*, not a check: this script never verifies a
signature and cannot — a signature verifies against the verifier's own trust store, and
a listing carries no key — so the verdict labels the value as declared and never as
proven. The field is OPTIONAL, and the three things a row can say about signing stay
three separate published facts: it names a signer, it declares ``unsigned``, or it left
the field out and said nothing at all.

There is no silent pass. Every check either succeeds or produces a blocking
:class:`Reason` — an unreachable repo, an unparseable manifest or an unexpected
exception all read as "not listable, here is why", never as "skipped".

Exit codes: ``0`` every changed row is listable · ``1`` at least one row is
blocked · ``2`` the input could not be read at all (usage / malformed file).
