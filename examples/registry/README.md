STAGING NOTE — DELETE THIS COMMENT WHEN PUBLISHING.

This directory is `scratch/registry/` in the Gideon core repo: content prepared
in-tree so it can be reviewed, tested and version-controlled before it exists as a
repository. It is ET-3 in docs/roadmap/plans/ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING.md. Nothing in core
imports it, and `scratch/` is outside pytest's testpaths and `make lint`'s targets —
see scratch/README.md.

Owner steps to publish:

  1. Create `gideon/registry` (public).
  2. Copy THIS directory's contents to the repository ROOT — not into a subdirectory.
     The workflows and the validator both assume `registry.json`,
     `validate_registry.py` and `requirements.txt` sit at the root.
  3. Delete this comment. Delete `fixtures/` only if you want to; the tests that use
     it live in core (`tests/test_registry_validation.py`), so the published copy
     works either way, and keeping it means the published repo can demonstrate its own
     three outcomes.
  4. `git commit -s`, push to `main`.
  5. Settings → require the `validate-listings / validate` check on `main`.

What is NOT proven until step 4 lands: whether GitHub actually runs these three
workflows. Every other behaviour — the four checks, all three verdict outcomes, the
schema's refusals — is proven offline by core's test suite against `file://` git
repositories built from `fixtures/apps/`, which is the same fetch code path a real
`https://` listing takes. Action versions here mirror what core's own
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` used on the day this was staged; check them once before the
first push.

# Gideon app registry

A list of community-built [Gideon](https://github.com/gideon/gideon)
apps. Gideon ships this repository's URL as a removable default git source, so
listed apps appear in the Store alongside any source you add yourself.

**This is a list, not a store and not an endorsement.** Every listing is contributed
by whoever wrote the app. The only automated judgement made here is a static scanner
dry-run whose verdict is published *with* the listing rather than used to quietly
curate it, and Gideon's install-time gate still runs on your own machine.

## The files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `registry.json` | the data. One object per listed app. |
| `registry.schema.json` | its JSON Schema. Generated — do not hand-edit. |
| `validate_registry.py` | the validator CI runs on every listing PR. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | **the listing policy** — what gets listed, what this list does not do. |
| `DELISTING.md` | what gets a listing removed, and how long that takes. |
| `fixtures/` | three apps and four candidate documents that pin the policy's outcomes. |

## Listing an app

Open a PR adding one row to `registry.json`. Read
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) first — it is short, and every rule in it is
enforced by CI rather than by review.

## What validation checks

Four things, on the rows a PR added or changed:

1. **Repo liveness** — `git ls-remote` reaches it, and it has a branch.
2. **Manifest fetch and parse** — a shallow clone carries an `app.json` that
   Gideon's own parser validates, and the row's `types` and
   `permissions_declared` match what that manifest actually declares.
3. **License present** — a license file in the repo, a `license` in the manifest, and
   the row agreeing with it.
4. **Scanner dry-run** — Gideon's `SkillScanner` over the clone at the
   `community` trust tier. `dangerous` blocks the listing and the rule that fired is
   recorded on the PR. `warning` and `low` are **displayed and never block**.

"Dry-run" is literal. The scanner is static text inspection; neither it nor the
validator executes a single line of a listed repository. Nothing is skipped on error
either — an unreachable repo or an unparseable manifest is a *failed* validation with
a stated reason, never a pass.

The validator imports core's manifest parser and core's scanner instead of
reimplementing either, so what the registry checks and what your install gate checks
cannot drift apart.

## Regenerating the schema

```bash
python validate_registry.py --emit-schema > registry.schema.json
```

`validate_registry.py` is the authority; the schema file mirrors it for editors and
third-party tooling. Regenerate after any change to the field list, and after a core
bump that adds a capability type.
