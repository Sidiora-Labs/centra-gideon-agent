# `scratch/` — content prepared in-tree for the owner to publish

Nothing here is imported, installed or served by Gideon. It is content that belongs in
**other** repositories, staged in this one so it can be reviewed, tested and version-controlled
before it is pushed. `scratch/` is outside `testpaths` and outside `make lint`'s targets, so it
does not participate in the core build.

ET-2 (`docs/roadmap/plans/ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING.md`, Session 1 T1.4) staged two things.

## 1. `app-template/` → `github.com/gideon/app-template`

The template repo's full content, to be pushed as the repository **root** (not inside a
subdirectory — the CI workflow reads `app.json` at the root).

```
app-template/
├── app.json                    # generated: app new app-template --type tool
├── provider.py                 # generated
├── app_cli.py                  # generated
├── test_provider.py            # generated (7 tests, pass as-is)
├── README.md                   # HAND-WRITTEN: the clone-to-installed walkthrough
├── LICENSE                     # generated (MIT)
├── .gitignore
└── .github/workflows/ci.yml    # HAND-WRITTEN: the apps-repo CI, root-level variant
```

The four generated files are pinned byte-for-byte to a fresh
`gideon app new app-template --type tool` run by
`tests/test_app_from_template.py::test_the_staged_template_is_byte_identical_to_a_fresh_scaffold`.
**If you change the scaffold, regenerate this directory in the same commit** — that test is the
only thing keeping the published template from contradicting the generator. To regenerate:

```bash
gideon app new app-template --type tool --dir scratch --force \
  --display-name "App Template" \
  --description "The Gideon app template: clone it, rename it, ship it." \
  --author "Gideon contributors"
```

(That overwrites `README.md` and `LICENSE` too, so restore those two from git afterwards.)

Owner steps to publish:

1. Create `gideon/app-template` (public, no template-repository flag needed — the repo
   is cloned or fetched as a tarball, not used via GitHub's "Use this template" button).
2. Copy this directory's contents to the repo root, `git commit -s`, push to `main`.
3. Nothing in core needs updating: `app new --from-template` already points at
   `https://codeload.github.com/gideon/app-template/tar.gz/refs/heads/main`.

**Until step 2 lands, the live fetch is unproven.** `--from-template` is proven end-to-end
against a local tarball and a loopback HTTP server; the one thing no test can cover is whether
the org repo answers, because it does not exist yet.

## 2. `apps-guide-quickstart.md` → `GideonApps/docs/app-creation-guide.md`

A "minutes to first run" quickstart to insert at the top of the apps repo's app-creation
guide. The file carries its own insertion instructions in an HTML comment, then the exact
markdown to paste below a marker line. Every command in it was executed verbatim from an empty
directory against a freshly-homed gateway; the wall-clock number in the text is measured, not
a target.
