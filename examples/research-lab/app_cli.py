"""CLI seams for research-lab: a setup step and a doctor probe.

``gideon setup`` calls :func:`setup` after the core steps; ``gideon doctor``
calls :func:`doctor` and renders the lines it returns as this app's section.

There is no credential to collect — this app never talks to a network. Setup's whole job
is to state the budget the campaigns it opens will inherit; doctor's is to say whether
the unattended loop has anything to work on.

This module reads the campaign directory itself instead of importing ``provider``: core
loads a CLI hook by file path, not as a package, so a sibling import is not guaranteed to
resolve when ``gideon doctor`` runs before anything has loaded the provider.
