# Changelog

All notable changes to Gideon are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The in-app Updates panel reads this file (`GET /api/changelog`) to show "what's new."

## [Unreleased]

> **Note (0.x clean break):** model bindings in `active_models.json` now carry
> ordered fallback-chain semantics. Old stores read cleanly (a single binding is a
> one-entry chain); consider `gideon snapshot` before upgrading, per the
> pre-1.0 banner.
>
> **Note (0.x clean break):** true rewind adds a `rewound` field to persisted chat
> messages (the retained discarded tail). Old sessions read cleanly (missing field =
> today's behavior — no migration); consider `gideon snapshot` before upgrading.
>
> **Note (0.x clean break):** knowledge-item tags move from a JSON column into their own
> tables, and the old column is dropped. Opening your library migrates it in place — the
> upgrade is verified against duplicates, blanks, non-ASCII and malformed values, and
> refuses to drop the column if any tag would be lost. Consider `gideon snapshot`
> before upgrading, per the pre-1.0 banner.

### Added

- **Memory can now offer itself, not just answer when asked.** Mention a person, project or
  tool the entity graph knows and Gideon can volunteer up to three linked memories for
  that turn — including ones that share no words with what you typed, which ordinary search
  structurally cannot find ("ships Fridays" doesn't match "when does Sparrow release?"). It
  costs no tokens or model calls, and it's **off by default**, because putting context in
  front of the model that you didn't ask for should be your choice. Turn it on under
  **Settings → Memory**, along with how confident a match has to be. The Health tab shows how
  often what it volunteered actually got used afterwards, so you can tighten the setting from
  evidence instead of guesswork. Temporary chats get nothing; incognito chats get the benefit
  without anything being recorded.

- **Take a conversation with you, and stop rebuilding the same chat setup.** Any chat can
  now be exported as **Markdown or JSON** from its context menu in the chat history —
  readable, pasteable, and **credential-redacted**, including the messages you typed
  yourself. Save a chat's setup (agent, model, reasoning effort) as a **starter** from its
  header, and it appears on the new-chat screen ready to pick; manage or remove starters
  under **Settings → Chat**. A starter captures the setup only, never the conversation.

- **Hand an artifact to the agent, or point at one mid-conversation.** An artifact — a
  widget, a document, a chart — can now be opened straight into a chat set up to *change*
  it: the agent starts with the current version in front of it and a prompt that names the
  artifact, so a revision lands as a new version of that artifact instead of a
  near-duplicate beside it. And in any chat you can now reference artifacts from the
  composer's **+** menu, which grounds the reply in whatever those artifacts say *right
  now*. Each reference is recorded on the artifact's own timeline, so you can see where it
  got used and jump back to that conversation.
- **Shelves for your knowledge library — including ones that fill themselves.** Saved
  documents, notes and links were one flat list. You can now group them onto
  **collections**: a *manual* shelf holds whatever you put on it, and a **smart** shelf
  holds whatever matches a search you name once — so "everything about the borrow
  checker" stays current on its own as you save more, with nothing to re-run and no
  backfill step.

  Items can sit on several shelves at once, and a shelf is a *view*, not a container:
  deleting one leaves every document in your library untouched (the confirmation says
  so). Each shelf has its own URL, so you can link straight to one. Alongside it, items
  gain a **reading state** — unread → reading → read, because "reading" is the state a
  reading list exists to represent — and a **favorite** star. Marking something read
  deliberately does *not* count as editing it, so working through a backlog won't
  reshuffle a library sorted by recency.
- **Clean up a long chat list in one action, and let old chats retire themselves.**
  Conversations pile up, and until now the only tools were one-at-a-time. You can now
  select many chats at once and **archive**, restore, tag, re-file, or exempt them in a
  single action — and chats you haven't touched in a while (30 days by default) move to
  **Archived** on their own.

  Archiving is not deleting, and that's the point: an archived chat keeps its full
  transcript, **stays searchable**, and is one click from coming back. That's what makes
  it safe to do automatically. Anything you want kept in the list forever can be pinned
  "never archive", and opening or replying to an archived chat brings it back by itself.
  Set the window in Settings, or set it to 0 to switch auto-archive off entirely.

  Two deliberate limits: bulk **delete** is not offered beside archive — irreversible
  actions shouldn't sit one mis-click from reversible ones — and chats with no recorded
  activity yet (everything from before this shipped) are never auto-archived, so
  upgrading can't sweep away your history.
- **On a shared task board, your assistant only works on *your* tasks.** If tasks come
  from somewhere other people also write to, task rows now show who a task belongs to,
  and you can switch between "Mine" and "Everyone" — the filter appears only when
  someone else's work is actually there, so nothing changes for a solo setup.

  The part that matters most is invisible: ready-task counts, the "what should I do
  next" picker, and the agent's own work selection all count and choose **only your
  tasks**. Someone else's task can never quietly become something your assistant picks
  up. Dependencies are still honored across everyone, so a task of yours blocked by a
  colleague's unfinished work is correctly *not* ready rather than falsely startable.
- **Decks and PDFs too — and anything already saved can become a document.**
  **deck_create** turns a markdown outline into a real PowerPoint deck: each `##` is a
  slide, the lines under it become bullets, and `<!-- notes: ... -->` becomes that slide's
  speaker notes. PDF generation works on every install rather than depending on whatever
  converter happens to be on the machine.

  And the library now works in both directions: point `document_create` at a saved
  knowledge item or a note you already have, and it comes back out as a Word document you
  can send. Same generator, so an exported document is no different from a freshly
  written one.

- **It can make you a Word document or a spreadsheet you can actually send.**
  Gideon could read .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and .pdf but could not produce a single
  one — everything it generated stayed inside the app. Ask for a document now and you get
  a real file: **document_create** turns markdown into a Word document (headings, bullets,
  numbered lists, tables, code, page breaks) and **sheet_create** builds a spreadsheet
  with a bold header row and frozen panes.

  Numbers stay numbers, so the result can be summed and charted — a spreadsheet full of
  text-formatted numbers is the main way generated ones turn out useless. Both land in
  your Artifacts library with version history, so re-generating one updates it in place
  instead of leaving a near-duplicate beside it, and each has a download button plus a
  text preview.

  Verified by opening the output in real applications, not just our own reader: macOS
  identifies the files as genuine Office documents and renders them correctly.

  Two things this fixed along the way. **Tables in Word documents you upload were being
  silently dropped** — the reader only looked at paragraphs, so often the densest
  information in a document was invisible to search and to the agent. And **generated
  videos were being stored as images**, which made them unplayable; video is now a real
  artifact type with a working player.

- **Tags are a real taxonomy now — nest them, rename them, merge them.** Tags were a
  flat list of strings stapled to each item, so a typo meant editing every item that
  carried it and there was no way to express that "tokio" is a kind of "rust". The new
  **Tags** view on the Knowledge page shows every tag with how many items actually use
  it, and lets you rename, nest one under another, merge two together, or delete one —
  from a right-click.

  Renaming is instant and applies everywhere at once. Merging moves every item onto the
  surviving tag and takes nested tags with it rather than orphaning them. Deleting a tag
  removes it from your items but never deletes the items, and its nested tags become
  top-level rather than disappearing with it. Unused tags are kept on purpose: a tag you
  built is part of your taxonomy even when nothing carries it this week.

  Two things this quietly fixed. **Tags with non-Latin characters were unsearchable** —
  a tag like 日本語 was stored in an escaped form the search index couldn't match, so it
  simply never came up; it does now. And the tags you write by hand are now marked as
  yours, so automatic enrichment can refresh the tags it generated without ever
  overwriting one you chose.

- **Your reading state and favorites are now visible, and filterable.** Marking a saved
  item as reading, read, or a favorite already worked — but nothing showed it anywhere,
  so favoriting was effectively write-only: you could star something and then had no way
  to find it again. Items now carry a **star** for favorites and a **reading** badge, a
  read item's title dims, and chips let you filter to Reading, Unread, Read or Favorites
  (each appearing only when there's something to show, with a count).

  Favorites finally have their own mark instead of borrowing the pin icon — pinning
  floats an item to the top of the list, favoriting is a personal bookmark, and they read
  as different things now. The reader gained the same two controls beside Pin and
  Archive. Unread items stay unbadged on purpose: it's the default state, and marking
  every new item would just be noise.

- **Curate a whole shelf of saved items in one action.** Working through a knowledge
  library one item at a time is what makes nobody do it. Select many items and **mark
  read or unread, favorite, add to a shelf, or archive** them together. Each action
  reports what actually happened — "38 shelved · 2 already there" — because a selection
  can go stale between the click and the request, and a partial success is not a failure.

  Marking a backlog read deliberately does *not* count as editing those items, so
  catching up won't reshuffle a library sorted by recency. Bulk **delete** is not
  offered beside these: everything here is reversible, and an irreversible action
  shouldn't sit one mis-click away from a safe one.
- **See what changed between two versions of an artifact.** An artifact keeps every
  version, but the only way to tell what actually moved between two of them was to open
  each in turn and compare by eye. **Compare versions** now shows a real side-by-side
  diff — for images, the two versions themselves, before and after. It opens on the two
  most recent versions, since "what changed in the last pass?" is usually the question,
  and you can pick any pair or swap which side is which.

  Whitespace-only changes are shown rather than hidden: an agent re-rendering a widget
  often re-indents it, and reporting "nothing changed" would be a lie.
- **Backups now happen on their own, and they get checked.** Gideon takes a
  full snapshot nightly and exports whatever changed every hour, so how much you can
  lose is bounded by an hour rather than by when you last remembered to run
  `gideon snapshot`.

  Retention keeps a *spread* instead of a window — two weeks of daily snapshots, then
  weekly, then monthly — so a year of history costs about 30 files and you can still
  reach back to January. Settings → **Backups** is where all of this lives: when each
  job last ran, a button to run one now, how long each tier is kept, and the snapshot
  list marking exactly which files the current settings would remove — before anything
  is removed. Restoring stays a command-line action, and the screen says so, because a
  restore has to replace live state while the gateway is stopped.

  Once a month it also runs a **restore drill**: the newest snapshot is unpacked into
  a temporary directory and every database inside it is integrity-checked, then you
  get a pass/fail notification. A backup nobody has restored is a hope, not a backup —
  and a failure is reported as a warning, so it isn't hidden by quiet hours.
  `durability.auto_backup` turns the schedule off if you'd rather do it by hand.

  Fixed while building it: the incremental export had been unable to notice memory
  changes at all. Databases run in WAL mode, so a saved change lands in a companion
  file and the main database's timestamp never moves — the export saw "nothing
  changed" through an entire session of work.
- **Find any chat by what was said in it.** Chat search now runs against a real
  full-text index of your transcripts instead of scanning the 500 most recent files,
  so a conversation from months ago is as findable as yesterday's — and each result
  shows the matching passage with your terms highlighted, so you can tell at a glance
  which chat is the one you meant.

  On a 120-chat history a content search returns in about 30 milliseconds. The index
  keeps itself current as you chat and repairs itself on a schedule, so there is
  nothing to maintain. **Incognito and temporary chats are never indexed** — and a
  chat you switch to incognito after the fact disappears from search immediately.
  If the index is ever unavailable, search quietly falls back to the previous
  behavior rather than failing.

  Fixed along the way: a chat marked incognito *after* some of it was written could
  still appear in content search, because only its saved mode was checked and that
  still read "persistent". Both search paths now honor the live setting.
- **The agent navigates your code by symbol instead of grepping blind.** Asking
  "where is this function defined and what calls it?" used to cost a grep, a couple
  of file reads, and often another grep — every round-trip spending tokens on
  navigation instead of the actual work. A new `code_map` tool answers it in one
  call from a tree-sitter index of your workspace, and `code_map_overview` gives the
  shape of an unfamiliar codebase (the most-referenced modules and their public
  surface) in one read.

  Indexing Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust and Go: on a 1,500-file repository
  the first pass takes about four seconds and later passes are effectively
  instant, since only changed files are re-read. The same index makes SDLC planning
  passes start from a map of the codebase rather than exploring for it, and ranks
  the chat composer's `@` file picker so widely-used modules surface above
  same-named leaves.

  It is strictly an accelerator: with no index, no parsers, or an unparseable file,
  everything falls back to the grep-and-read behavior it had before, and the tool
  says so plainly rather than guessing.
- **Memory now knows what it's *about*.** Every memory is linked to the people,
  projects and tools it names, so asking "what do I know about Ana?" follows those
  links instead of hoping a similarity search surfaces everything. A memory about a
  standup, a stored fact about a repo, and a lesson from last month finally connect
  when they concern the same thing.

  Linking happens the moment a memory is written and **costs nothing** — no tokens,
  no model call, just exact-name matching against the people and projects you've
  named. Links are typed, so the graph distinguishes a memory that's *about* you
  from one that merely mentions a project.

  Unknown names are **proposed, never invented**: a name that shows up across three
  separate memories appears in Memory → Health for one-click accept, because a junk
  entity quietly degrades every future search. Everything is reversible through the
  existing memory undo. Find it under **Settings → Memory → Health**, where
  *Rebuild links* seeds entities from what you've already stored and links your
  whole history in one pass. `memory.graph_enabled` turns it off — existing links
  are kept, so turning it back on needs no rebuild.

  > **Note (0.x clean break):** this adds tables to `memory.db` (schema v7). Old
  > stores upgrade in place on first run with no data loss and nothing to migrate;
  > consider `gideon snapshot` beforehand, per the pre-1.0 banner.
- **Your IDE can now actually ask your assistant things.** The MCP endpoint ships with
  six read-only tools: recall what the assistant remembers, search your saved documents,
  list or read a task, search past conversations by what was said, and check what the
  instance can currently do. Every answer is wrapped as data rather than instructions,
  conversation results are credential-redacted, and temporary or incognito chats are
  never searchable. There is no path from any of these to a write — the tool list is
  short and hand-written precisely so that stays true.

  **Security fix found while building it:** credential redaction did not recognize LLM
  provider API keys. Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, and Google keys pasted into a chat were
  invisible to the redactor, so they could survive into anything that strips secrets on
  the way out — session-search results and conversation titles included. All of those
  key shapes are now redacted everywhere redaction applies.
- **Point your IDE at your assistant: a read-only MCP endpoint.** Gideon can
  now answer questions from a local MCP client (your IDE, an MCP inspector) over
  `POST /mcp` — JSON-RPC 2.0, with `initialize`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`.
  It is **off until you deliberately turn it on**, and turning it on takes two
  separate steps that are both re-checked on every request:

  ```bash
  gideon inbound token create mcp        # printed once — copy it now
  gideon config set inbound.mcp.enabled true
  ```

  Because both are checked per request, `inbound.mcp.enabled false` is an immediate
  kill switch — no restart. The surface answers **loopback callers only** unless you
  explicitly declare a public URL and opt into remote access in the config file;
  neither of those knobs is editable from the dashboard, so widening your network
  exposure can't be one mis-click in a browser. Requests are capped on every
  dimension an outside caller controls (body size, rate, concurrency, result size),
  refused requests come back with a real JSON-RPC error, and every request — allowed
  or refused — is recorded in `<home>/inbound_audit.jsonl`, with refusals also
  landing in the security event log. This release ships the surface with **no tools
  yet**: a client can connect and see an empty table. The five curated read-only
  tools (memory, knowledge, tasks, sessions, status) follow next, and by
  construction they can only ever read — there is no path from an inbound request to
  a write.
- **Tool groups: the agent loads the tools it needs, not all of them.** Every tool
  provider is now an activatable **group** (`schedule`, `artifacts`, `memory`, one
  per MCP server or app, …), and a session can run with only the groups it needs —
  so unused capabilities cost one line of catalog instead of every schema. Measured
  on the 69-tool built-in surface: a background session's tool block drops **56%
  (~6,900 tokens per turn)**. The agent manages this itself via a new `reset_tools`
  tool that takes the *final* set of groups it wants.
  Capability is never reduced, only context: **every tool stays callable by name
  even while its group is inactive**, each inactive group advertises itself in one
  line, and `tool_search` still searches everything — naming the activation step
  when it finds a tool in an inactive group. Off by default (`tools.groups_enabled`),
  and interactive chat keeps every group active even when on, so nothing changes for
  the chat you're watching; background, loop, and subagent runs start focused
  (tune per surface with `tools.group_defaults`). `GET /api/tools` now reports each
  tool's group.
- **The artifacts library: live previews, search, and collections.** The new
  Artifacts page is now a real library: a responsive grid where every card renders
  a **live preview** — widgets/HTML/React/documents/SVG in the same sandboxed,
  theme-injected frame chat widgets use (scaled down, inert, never re-implemented),
  images from their raw bytes, prose as an excerpt. Previews mount lazily as cards
  approach the viewport and at most a dozen live frames exist at once (older ones
  quietly demote to placeholders), so a 200-artifact library scrolls smoothly. The
  toolbar filters by text, kind, source, and **collection** — all URL-backed, so a
  filtered view is shareable — plus Recent/Name/Kind sort. Opening a card gives the
  full-page detail (version rail, events timeline, edit/snapshot/revert) with
  `?v=N` deep-linking a historical snapshot read-only, and a header control to
  assign the artifact to a collection. File-backed cards show a "source changed"
  drift badge.
- **Artifacts get their own page.** Artifacts — the named, versioned outputs agents
  produce — moved out of the Files page into their own top-level **Artifacts** nav
  entry (`#/artifacts`, deep-linkable per slug). Files now shows only your raw file
  roots; old `#/files/<slug>` artifact links (in past chats and event timelines)
  redirect automatically to the artifact's new home, and "Save as artifact" from a
  file jumps you there. The viewer itself is unchanged — render, edit/snapshot,
  version history + revert, and the events timeline all work exactly as before.
- **Artifacts: collections + save-time dedup.** Saved artifacts can now carry a
  **collection** label (a free-form grouping for the coming library), settable at
  save time and reassignable later, and filterable via `GET /api/artifacts?collection=`
  and the `artifact_list` tool. And saving no longer silently mints duplicates: a
  fresh `artifact_save` (or `POST /api/artifacts`) whose name matches an existing
  artifact now **refuses with a hint** — the tool tells the agent to update the
  existing slug or pass `force`, and the REST route returns `409 similar_artifact_exists`
  with the existing slug (bypass with `?force=1`). File-backed saves keep their
  existing source-path dedup. Pre-existing artifacts load unchanged (tolerant read).
- **Agent routing: suggest the right specialist, never route silently.** Give an
  installed agent a **Specialty** and comma-separated **Routing hints** (in the agent
  editor), and when a message in a default-agent chat clearly fits it, a quiet
  "route to `<agent>`?" chip appears above the composer. One click re-targets the
  session (via the existing agent-switch path); the ✕ dismisses it and suppresses
  that agent for a cooldown (three dismissals mute it until you re-enable). It is a
  **proposal** — nothing changes until you click — and classification is
  deterministic-first (keyword-phrase overlap, then embedding cosine when an
  embedding model is bound), with the LLM never in the hot path. Silent auto-routing
  is deliberately out of scope. Route/dismiss also feed the routing pair's accuracy
  into Settings → AI feedback. Tune it in Settings → Chat → Agent routing
  (`agents_routing.*`); zero behavior change until you author routing metadata.
- **Chat craft: seven chat-surface mechanics.** The chat surface gains the pieces
  the sibling platforms proved out. **True rewind** — edit ANY past user message and
  replay from there; the discarded answers are kept in this chat's history (viewable
  under a "rewound from here" divider, restorable as a fork) and the provider context
  rebuilds from the truncated transcript, so the agent never references the undone
  turns. **Queue with manners** — each queued message now has an "Interrupt now" that
  gracefully stops the running turn and runs that message next. **Find in
  conversation** — Cmd/Ctrl+F opens an in-chat find bar (count, next/prev, jump-to-
  match) that highlights every occurrence without ever re-rendering the markdown.
  **Quote toolbar** — selecting transcript text floats a Quote + Copy toolbar; Quote
  inserts an attributed blockquote (who said it) into the composer, now from keyboard
  and touch selections too. **Follow-up chips** — after each reply, 2-3 suggested next
  messages appear via one cheap background call (never blocks the turn; skipped for
  temporary/incognito chats and silent when no model is bound; toggle in Settings →
  Chat). **Smoother streaming** — the reveal snaps to word boundaries so text lands in
  whole words, with a new Settings → Chat "Streaming text reveal" (smooth | immediate)
  control.
- **Background compression keeps long chats fast.** Old, idle conversation history
  is now topic-segmented and compressed in the background on the maintenance
  cadence — the always-on complement to on-demand tool-output projection. A
  transcript untouched for a week (default) is split into topics (by embedding drift
  when an embedding model is bound; a deterministic turn-count fallback otherwise),
  then compressed by attention: the most-recent topic stays verbatim, middle topics
  reduce to their request/response pairs, and the oldest tier is summarized by a
  cheap background model. It only ever touches sessions **at rest** (never a live
  turn), incognito/temporary chats are skipped entirely, every dropped span is
  archived first (fully recoverable) and any tool-result recovery handle is
  preserved, and savings land in the TokenJuice ledger under `bg_topic`. Toggle and
  idle window live in Settings → Chat config (`tools.bg_compress_enabled` /
  `tools.bg_compress_idle_days`); disabling it stops the pass within one tick.
- **Feedback that actually teaches: 👍/👎 on AI judgments.** Inbox classifications,
  drafted replies, digests, and loop findings now carry a quiet thumbs pair. 👍 is
  silent-positive ("Mark accurate" — it only feeds the accuracy denominator); 👎
  optionally takes a one-line "why". Every verdict is attributed to the source that
  produced the judgment — the bound prompt, the loop judge, a workflow's surfacing —
  and per-source rolling accuracy lives in Settings → AI feedback (honest counts,
  shown only after enough verdicts). A source that keeps being wrong **stops
  surfacing** and raises a one-time "retire this rule?" notification with a deep
  link; snooze or clear it after an edit. Everything is deterministic counting —
  no model calls, and feedback never leaves the instance. Apps record feedback on
  their own judgments via `gideon.sdk.feedback` / `POST /api/feedback`
  (namespaced server-side, so an app can never impersonate a core source).
- **Investigate anywhere: chat about any entity with its context pre-loaded.** Inbox
  items and loop findings (more surfaces to follow) gain an "Investigate in chat"
  button that opens a fresh chat carrying the entity's full context — composed
  server-side from the owning store, injected as fenced untrusted data on your
  first message (never pasted into your visible text), with the composer pre-filled
  with an editable opening question. The session opens in read-only **Ask** mode —
  investigating never mutates the entity; you escalate the mode yourself. A header
  chip deep-links back to the source. Apps get the same primitive via
  `useInvestigate` in the app SDK.
- **Model use-cases v2: routing sub-categories + fallback chains.** Chat work is
  now routable by kind — `background` (titles, tags, suggestions, digests,
  consolidation), `orchestration` (supervising turns and model-less subagents),
  `loops` (goal-loop workers and judges), alongside the existing `code_tools` and
  `reasoning` — each bindable in Settings → Models under a new **Chat routing**
  group, falling back to your Chat chain when unbound. Bind a cheap or local model
  to `background` and housekeeping chores stop burning your flagship chat model.
- **Every model binding is an ordered fallback chain.** The first model is the
  default; later entries take over when an earlier provider's circuit breaker is
  open or a call fails (background calls advance mid-batch; a failed chain surfaces
  one clear error). The Models panel gains a chain editor with reordering and
  per-entry provider-health dots; the composer's model pick sits above the chain —
  if the picked model fails, the chain takes over.
- **Type-routed tool-output compressors.** Large tool results now project smarter: a
  JSON array of thousands of items becomes a per-field schema (names, types, ranges,
  null counts) plus the first/last item verbatim; a large code file becomes a
  signatures-and-docstrings outline with a line map (`code` is a new content type,
  sniffed conservatively). The full raw always stays one `tool_result_get` away.
- **Projection rules: three layers + line operations.** A builtin rule pack now
  recognises common command output (git, pytest, npm, docker, cargo…) so e.g. a
  `git diff` run through the shell projects as a diff; a repo can ship its own
  `.gideon/projection_rules.json` (project layer, beats user rules); and every
  rule may carry declarative line operations — head/tail window, keep/skip filters,
  and a fold-repeats counter — editable in Settings → Tool output.
- **Background prose summarizer.** Long natural-language output on background paths
  can be model-summarized with a guaranteed deterministic fallback (never wired into
  the synchronous tool path).

- **"Investigate in chat" is now on everything worth asking about.** The affordance
  that shipped for inbox items and loop findings now covers eleven more kinds:
  notifications, tasks, schedule runs, triggers, loop cycles, knowledge items, memory
  records and lessons, Doctor findings, crash reports, and audit events. One click opens
  a read-only chat already carrying that entity's context, with the question already
  written for you.
  Failures get the richest context, which is the point: investigating a failed cron or
  loop notification pulls in **the run it's about** — its task, status, latest finding,
  the job's cadence and consecutive-failure count — and asks "why did this fail?".
  A Doctor finding re-runs its probes and brings the offered fix's *dry-run preview*
  (never applying it). A learned lesson brings its provenance and the chain of beliefs
  it replaced, and asks "why do you believe this?". An audit entry brings the other
  entries from the same approval flow, so one decision reads as one story.
- **Tool groups are now visible, and they hide what can't work.** The Tools page shows
  the group partition — every group with its tool count, which ones are always loaded,
  and what each kind of session starts with — plus the switch to turn grouping on or
  off. Each tool provider is labeled with the group it belongs to. And groups whose
  capability isn't configured (subagent tools with no model bound, say) are now hidden
  entirely rather than offered in a state where they'd fail; asking to activate one
  says so plainly instead of quietly doing nothing. New `GET /api/tools/groups` reports
  the partition for anything else that needs it.

- **Personalities: themes that carry an identity, not just a palette.** Settings → Design
  now offers a **personality** — one switch that sets the color scheme, the wordmark, the
  browser tab title, and the interface density together, and can offer the assistant a
  matching name. Two are included as starting points (a mono-green **Retro Terminal** with
  a terse operator voice, and **Gideon Arcade**), alongside the default Gideon identity.
  Renaming the assistant is **offered, never assumed**: activating a personality shows a
  toggle naming the exact setting it would change, and declining it switches the look while
  leaving your configuration alone. Switching back restores everything, including the name.
  Every personality's palette goes through the same accessibility contrast checks as the
  built-in schemes, so a personality can't ship an unreadable theme.

- **A username, so your contributions stay attributable.** Settings → Account now takes
  a short handle (Settings suggests one from your name), and Gideon stamps it onto
  things you create — tasks and task comments carry an author. It's a label, not a login:
  nothing signs in with it, and leaving it empty keeps records unattributed exactly as
  before. Renaming it affects future writes only; existing records keep the name they
  were written with, because rewriting them would falsify the very history attribution
  exists to preserve.

- **Backups you can actually read and verify: `gideon backup`.** Alongside the
  opaque snapshot tarball, state can now be exported as **deterministic shards** —
  one canonical JSONL file per store plus a SHA-256 manifest. Identical state always
  produces identical bytes, so the export diffs cleanly (adding one task shows up as
  exactly one added line — `git log` over your shards becomes a readable history of
  what the assistant learned) and a future sync never re-uploads data that didn't
  change. `gideon backup validate` re-derives every shard's size, row count and
  checksum, re-parses every row, and **exits non-zero** on any problem, so you can run
  it from cron: a backup nobody has verified is a hope, not a backup. `--incremental`
  re-exports only what changed. Secrets are never included — shards are the
  representation that leaves your machine.

### Fixed

- **Auto-archive skipped the very chats it existed to tidy — and you couldn't see or
  change the rule.** Chats are archived after a period of inactivity (30 days by default),
  but the sweep only considered conversations currently loaded in memory. Since old chats
  aren't loaded until you open them, a conversation idle for months was exactly the one the
  rule could never reach: it ran hourly and reported that nothing was stale. The sweep now
  covers chats that exist only on disk, archiving them in place without loading them.
  Separately, the threshold had no control anywhere in the app — it now lives under
  **Settings → Chat → Context & lifecycle**, showing how many chats are currently stale so
  you can see what the rule would do before it does it. Archiving remains fully
  reversible; nothing is deleted.

- **The "Steer" button never steered.** Typing while an answer was streaming showed a
  button labelled *"Steer — send into the running turn"*, and clicking it queued the
  message for *after* that turn instead — then displayed a card reading "1 queued · sent
  one at a time as each turn finishes", contradicting the button you had just pressed. The
  message was never lost, but it never did what the label promised. Steering now actually
  reaches the answer being written, and the message appears above the composer marked as
  steered rather than queued.

  Four independent faults each guaranteed the failure, which is why it survived: the
  frontend asked for `followup` regardless of the button; the lookup used a session key the
  session manager never registers, so the steer path could not match a session *at all*;
  the drain lived only after a tool batch, so a plain-prose turn — the most common kind —
  ran past it and discarded the message; and the confirmation event was filtered out as
  status noise, so even a successful steer was invisible. A steer sent to a runtime with
  no delivery path used to be buffered and silently dropped while the API answered
  `{"steered": true}`, growing an unread backlog for the life of the process; it now
  queues visibly instead. Mid-turn handling also gained a **Steer** option in
  Settings → Chat, alongside Queue and Replace — the policy field shipped earlier with no
  control at all.
- **Knowledge and memory could never embed with a config-defined provider.** With an
  embedding model bound to a provider you configured yourself (an Ollama endpoint, say),
  ingested knowledge items sat at "processing" with no embedding **forever** — no error,
  no notification, just nothing. Semantic search and the entity graph had nothing to work
  with, and memory's semantic layer could not embed at all. Chat through the very same
  provider worked, which made it look like embedding was broken rather than unavailable.
  The cause: configured providers are replayed into the model registry during gateway
  startup, but the background embed pass could run before or outside that path and then
  saw an empty registry. It now replays the configured providers itself when a lookup
  misses, so the embed succeeds instead of silently returning nothing — and a provider
  that genuinely is not configured still reports that plainly rather than retrying. (#47)
- **Binding a model can no longer fail silently.** `PUT /api/models/active/{use_case}`
  answered "ok" in two cases where the binding had not actually taken. A request whose
  body never mentioned `models` — an automation or a person reasonably guessing the key
  name — was read as "clear this binding", so it **unset the use-case's model and still
  reported success**. And on a fresh install (a config with no providers configured yet)
  the unknown-provider check was skipped entirely, so a model reference naming a provider
  that does not exist was stored unchallenged as a dead binding. Now a body without
  `models` is a `400` that names the keys it did receive, clearing requires an explicit
  `{"models": []}`, and an unknown provider is rejected whether or not other providers are
  configured. The model *id* is still deliberately not checked against the discovered
  catalog — a real provider that is slow to enumerate its models must not have valid
  references rejected. (#48)
- **Settings and the Store no longer blink to a loading skeleton when you touch
  anything.** Clicking "Check" for updates, flipping a toggle, rotating a key, adding a
  lexicon entry, or finishing an app install tore the whole panel (or the entire apps
  grid) down to a skeleton and rebuilt it — reading as a jarring full-page refresh even
  though the data had barely changed. One shared cause: the stale-while-revalidate cache
  dropped its value the instant a panel asked to reload, so every panel's "no data yet →
  show a skeleton" branch fired on the way to fresh data that was already in flight.
  Reloading now *holds* what is on screen and swaps in the new data when it lands, which
  is what stale-while-revalidate was supposed to mean. Switching to a genuinely different
  resource still clears, so one page's rows can never paint under another's filter. The
  fix is in the shared data hook, so all **88 reload sites across 32 panels** are covered
  at once. (#52)
- **Installing an app and updating Gideon both failed on a `uv` virtualenv.**
  A `uv venv` ships no `pip` module — uv is the installer — but four separate code
  paths hardcoded `python -m pip install`, so each died with `No module named pip`
  on the project's own documented dev setup and on the uv-based end-user install
  path. Installing **any** app that declares `pythonDependencies` failed, and
  Settings → Updates showed "Update failed — pip upgrade failed" forever with no way
  to see why (the real cause was logged but never sent to the UI). Now one resolver
  picks the installer that actually exists — **uv** (targeted at the running
  interpreter, so the packages land where the gateway imports from) or **pip** — and
  says so plainly, naming both remedies, when neither is available. The update panel
  now shows the **real** failure reason instead of a static label, with the
  installer's colour codes stripped and the meaningful line first. The same resolver
  also fixes startup dependency repair and the git-checkout updater's editable
  install, which had the identical assumption. (#46, #51)
- **`gideon snapshot` was not backing up everything — and could copy a live
  database unsafely.** Two real problems, both closed. Your **tasks, projects,
  autonomous runs, artifacts, prompts, workflows, agents, installed apps, and
  per-entity settings were in no backup at all** — the snapshot carried a
  hand-written file list that had drifted from what the app actually stores, so a
  "full backup" could silently omit your entire task board. And only two of the
  five databases were copied with SQLite's safe backup API; the rest
  (knowledge, lexicon, autonomous-run records) were copied as plain files while
  the gateway held them open, which can capture a half-written database. In a
  reproduction of that case, a raw copy lost **2000 of 4000 rows**; the fixed path
  captures all of them.
  There is now one declared inventory of every store, which the snapshot and the
  portable export both read — plus a test that fails the build the moment a new
  store or database is added without being declared, so this can't drift again.
- **Snapshots of a non-default home no longer land in your real home.** With
  `GIDEON_HOME` set, the archive went to `~/.gideon/snapshots` anyway,
  mixing two installs' backups in the directory that retention pruning walks.

### Changed

- **Breaking-change policy is now written down, and it distinguishes maintainer from
  contributor.** During 0.x the maintainer keeps making backward-incompatible
  clean-break architectural changes with no migrations — that stays true, and the
  README now says plainly that this is expected to last a while, because
  migration-backed discipline (the lifecycle doctrine) is scheduled deliberately late,
  once the architecture stops moving. What's new is the other half: **contributors are
  not expected to make breaking changes.** Contributor guidance stays
  lifecycle-doctrine-shaped — additive by default, no hand-rolled gate or migration
  machinery, and surface a needed break in an issue or PR description instead of
  shipping it, so the maintainer decides whether to take it, reshape it, or schedule
  it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes); the PR template's change
  class now spells out both paths.

Forward-looking work is tracked in [docs/roadmap/](docs/roadmap/roadmap.md).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-26

The **safety-and-resilience** release: the autonomy guardrails program (kill switch,
spend budgets, denylist, outbound scanning, named safety profiles), the full Platform
Resilience program (Doctor health probes, no-model degraded mode, mid-turn message
policy, confirm-gated fixes + trust simulators + crash capture, and a health-scored
self-maintenance engine), first-party apps in the Store on a plain install, the
legibility surfaces (self-documenting UI kit, Discover, routed project context, offline
agent reference), and a render-smoke gate that closes the v0.1.0 blank-dashboard hole.

### Added

- **One health-scored maintenance engine replaces scattered upkeep.** Gideon now
  computes a **health score** (100 − measured deficits: knowledge items missing an
  embedding, orphaned stale locks, skills due for aging — each capped, and an *unfixable*
  deficit like "no embedder bound" is excluded rather than held against a score you can't
  improve) and runs a **dependency-ordered remediation plan** to raise it: re-index,
  orphan-prune, skill-age, stopping when the target score is reached, the per-run dollar
  cap is spent, or the plan is exhausted. It runs itself on an **adaptive heartbeat cadence**
  (further apart when healthy, sooner when degraded) and is visible + runnable on demand
  from Settings → Doctor → Maintenance, with a run ledger. Deterministic jobs are free;
  model-touching jobs (future) charge the guardrails spend meter. Every run is idempotent
  (per-job cooldowns) and the whole engine is one toggle — disabling it falls back to the
  legacy per-tick heartbeat maintenance. This is the final slice of the **Platform
  Resilience** program (Doctor · degraded mode · mid-turn · fixes/simulators/crash-capture ·
  this engine).
- **The Doctor can now fix what it finds, explain what it surfaces, and remember what
  crashed.** Three additions to the health surface (all Settings → Doctor):
  **confirm-gated fixes** — a finding that has a repair (a `static/dist` copy shadowing
  the runtime symlink, stale locks/rollback leftovers, model bindings pointing at removed
  providers) shows a **Fix** button with a read-only preview; nothing auto-applies, a
  two-step confirm runs it, and every application is security-audited and touches harness
  mechanics only (never your content). A **per-provider selftest** fires a tiny real
  inference per capability (a one-token chat / short embed) for true ground-truth instead
  of a reachability guess. A **surfacing simulator** dry-runs the skill scorer in explain
  mode — type a query and see, per candidate, the keyword/semantic scores, the thresholds,
  and exactly why each skill was included or excluded (zero model calls). And **structured
  crash capture**: an unhandled failure at a turn/loop/gateway boundary now writes one
  redacted, recoverable artifact under `~/.gideon/crashes/` (capped, never uploaded)
  that the Doctor surfaces as a card — a mid-stream death leaves a record instead of a lost
  stack trace.
- **Mid-turn message policy: queue (default) or cancel-and-replace.** A follow-up sent
  while a turn is still generating now follows a *declared* policy. The default,
  **`queue`**, is today's behavior formalized — the message is delivered next turn. Opt
  into **`cancel_and_replace`** (a platform default in Settings, overridable per channel)
  and a rapid follow-up instead cancels the in-flight answer and starts fresh with the new
  message — no stale ghost response, no wasted compute. A per-session debounce coalesces a
  burst of messages into ONE cancel + the last message. The guard is strict: only
  **interactive** turns (the web chat, a channel DM) are ever cancel-and-replaced —
  unattended work (goal loops, cron, subagents, the heartbeat) always queues, so a user
  message can never pull the rug out from under a background job. Built on the existing
  soft-cancel verb and turn-end queue drain (no new dispatch path); a new
  `resilience/active_jobs.py` tracks each turn's origin as the bookkeeping behind the
  decision.
- **No-model degraded mode: the assistant stays useful, and honest, with no model bound.**
  Every model-dependent surface now declares its **LLM-free floor** explicitly, so an
  offline laptop (dead ollama, wiped cache, no API key) degrades by design instead of
  error-walling: search drops from hybrid to keyword (FTS) + graph + recency ranking;
  the inbox keeps raising keyword/name-mention alerts (only auto-classify/draft/digest
  pause); knowledge still captures documents (only entity/insight extraction is skipped,
  marking the item partial); memory keeps its deterministic preference-facet capture;
  speech features turn visibly off rather than erroring; and chat says so plainly rather
  than faking a reply. A compact **degraded chip** appears in the shell (with a popover
  listing each degraded surface, its floor, and any pending-enrichment backlog) whenever a
  surface is running on its floor, and a notification fires on the transition down
  (`warning`) and on recovery (`info`). A lint test asserts every non-interactive
  model-call site maps to a registered contract, so a future surface can't ship without
  declaring its floor. New `GET /api/resilience/degraded`; two guard-class config switches
  (`resilience.doctor_enabled`, `resilience.degraded_indicator` — a missing/unknown value
  keeps the surface visible).
- **A Doctor tab now diagnoses every subsystem from one read-only view.** Settings →
  Doctor runs **tiered health probes** — process → socket → cheap-RPC → per-capability
  — across memory (db + faiss consistency), channels, local models (availability +
  phantom bindings), app backends (+ interrupted-update leftovers), the SPA
  `static/dist` symlink (the stale-SPA bug-class), and model-provider breakers
  (composed from the guardrails audit). The core doctrine is enforced: **a degraded
  capability never marks the gateway down and never suggests a restart** — only a
  core-tier failure does. Every probe is read-only and fail-safe (an exception
  becomes a failed row, never a 500), and secrets are redacted from probe output. New
  endpoints `GET /api/doctor` (all capabilities, cached 30s) and
  `GET /api/doctor/{capability}` (re-run one card); the dashboard System Health strip
  gains a one-line rollup that appears only when something needs attention and links
  to the tab. Confirm-gated auto-fixes and the trust/debug simulators land in later
  Platform-Resilience sessions.
- **First-party apps now appear in the Store on a plain install.** The published
  first-party apps repository (`github.com/Gideon/GideonApps`) ships as
  a default Store source, so a bare `pip install gideon` surfaces every
  first-party app — model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama, …),
  search, speech, channels — without the dev workspace tree. They appear
  **uninstalled**: nothing runs until you click Install, so the per-app
  install-consent + provider-agnostic-core contracts are unchanged. The source is a
  built-in default (not user-removable); the dev filesystem source and the
  `GIDEON_FIRST_PARTY_APPS_DIR` override still work for offline/local-clone
  development. The Store's catalog scan is cached (5-minute TTL) and runs off the
  event loop, so the first open clones once in the background.
- **Every non-interactive model call now passes through one guarded seam.**
  Background LLM calls (the `reasoning` axis behind `one_shot_completion`, the
  goal-loop judges, the loop gates, web-extract) are now wrapped in a
  **model-call guard** — the LLM twin of the network egress chokepoint. It adds a
  **per-provider circuit breaker** (opens after N consecutive failures, half-opens
  after a recovery window): during a provider outage an overnight run fails in
  microseconds instead of stacking timeouts. It adds a **hard wall-clock timeout**
  on every call, and an **attempt-level JSONL audit trail**
  (`~/.gideon/model_calls.jsonl`, one line per attempt, trimmed to the most
  recent entries) recording provider, model, latency, tokens, and outcome. The
  **interactive chat stream is deliberately untouched** — a human is watching it.
  `one_shot_completion` also gains a typed **`output_type`** option: pass `dict`
  or `list` to require a parseable JSON shape, and a parse miss is retried once
  with a targeted correction note before raising a loud `OutputContractError` —
  replacing the silent `None` degrade that `parse_llm_json` returned at every
  call site (migrated: web-extract, inbox classify). Goal-loop and eval judge
  verdicts gain a bounded **`reasoning`** field written before the verdict, so a
  structured-output constraint no longer suppresses the judge's chain of thought.
  A new graded provider capability descriptor (`structured_output`:
  `none`/`json_mode`/`json_schema`) lets provider apps opt into native
  schema enforcement in a later change; until then every provider gets the
  universal parse-with-retry path. This is a **clean break** (pre-1.0): the new
  audit trail is additive on-disk state under `~/.gideon/` — **run
  `gideon snapshot` before upgrading** if you want a rollback point.
  (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §2, Session 1.)
- **Unattended spend now has budgets, and outbound prompts are scanned for
  secrets.** A new **Guardrails** settings section (`config.json` → `guardrails`)
  adds daily spend ceilings for unattended work: set a **max tokens/day** or
  **max dollars/day** and when the day's automated spend hits the ceiling, further
  unattended LLM calls are refused (a cron agent fire is skipped with a one-time
  "daily automation budget reached" notification, a subagent spawn is refused) —
  interactive chat is never budget-gated. Spend is metered at the model-call seam
  into `~/.gideon/spend.json` (per-day, pruned after 30 days), with dollars
  estimated from the existing per-model price table (provider-reported cost
  preferred). Every outbound prompt bound for a **remote** provider is scanned for
  secrets/PII (AWS keys, private keys, Slack tokens, emails, phone numbers) and
  handled per a configurable **scan mode**: `warn` (log + send), `redact`
  (substitute + send, the default), or `block` (refuse the call); a local provider
  is always `warn` since its content never leaves the machine. The circuit-breaker
  thresholds from Session 1 are now configurable here too (failure threshold,
  recovery seconds). Defaults are **unlimited budget + redact**, so an existing
  install's behavior is unchanged until you set a ceiling. Clean break (pre-1.0):
  additive on-disk state (`spend.json`) — **run `gideon snapshot` before
  upgrading** for a rollback point. (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.1, §2.2, Session 2.)
- **A kill switch, a path/action denylist, and a live-write guard for unattended
  work.** Three safety-floor controls land. (1) **`gideon incident on`** (and
  `POST /api/incident`) suspends every unattended fire — cron, hooks, event
  triggers, subagent spawns — within one poll interval; **interactive chat keeps
  working**, and resuming requires an explicit `gideon incident off` (or
  `POST /api/incident/resume {confirm:true}`). Activation/resume are tamper-evidently
  logged. (2) A **path/action denylist** (`security.autonomy_denylist`, rules of
  `{paths, actions, verdict: block|needs_human}`) is enforced at all three
  action-dispatch seams (script hooks, scheduled jobs, memory-event triggers), so
  an app-contributed action provider inherits it without cooperating; it composes
  with the always-on built-in sensitive-path + destructive-command denylists. A
  `needs_human` rule holds the action and raises a needs-input notification instead
  of dropping it. (3) **`GIDEON_DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES=1`** makes live,
  hard-to-reverse writes (deleting a downloaded model, a non-GET request to a
  non-loopback host) refuse with a loud typed error instead of executing — and it
  is auto-set for the whole test suite, structurally closing the bug class where a
  destructive test once deleted a real bound model. Guard flags parse fail-safe
  (a missing/typo'd value keeps the guard ON), and the outbound scan now defaults
  to `redact` (never the leaky `warn`), enforced by a schema test. Clean break
  (pre-1.0): additive config + an `incident.json` flag file — **run `gideon
  snapshot` before upgrading**. (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.2–§1.4, §5, Session 3.)
- **A Guardrails settings surface, a provider-health view, and named safety
  profiles.** The safety floor gets its cockpit and its posture layer. A new
  **Settings → Guardrails** panel gathers the incident kill switch (with a
  one-click toggle), the daily spend budgets, the outbound scan mode, and the
  circuit-breaker tuning — and a **provider-health view** derived from the
  model-call audit (per-provider breaker state, pass rate, p50/p90/p99 latency,
  recent failure modes; `GET /api/models/health`, computed from files already on
  disk — no telemetry). A **persistent incident banner** now shows on every page
  while incident mode is active, with inline Resume. Under the hood, **named safety
  profiles** (`interactive` / `coding` / `review-only` / `cleanup` / `incident` /
  `headless`) become the single object that decides approval + tool grants + egress
  tier + budget + scan for a run; unattended runs (cron, subagents, channel, inbox,
  loop workers) resolve to the read-only **`headless`** profile *by construction*
  from their session key, and a curated **package-registry egress tier** lets a
  sandboxed run reach pypi/npm/crates/GitHub/… without opening the whole internet.
  Defaults preserve today's behavior. Clean break (pre-1.0), additive. (AUTONOMY-
  GUARDRAILS §2.5, §3, §4.2, §4.4, Session 4.)
- **The animated dot-wave backdrop is now a choosable background style.** A new
  **Background** control in Settings → Design → Backdrop & motion switches the
  surface behind chat, the new-chat composer, and onboarding between four modes:
  `waves` (the animated breathing dot-wave surface, default), `still` (the same
  dot field frozen — the lattice without the motion), `glow` (only the soft light
  hugging the composer, no dots), and `none` (a plain, empty canvas). The choice
  persists in your appearance settings and applies live with no reload. Motion
  modes still honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (they render one static frame).
- **Gideon describes its own UI kit, guides you to the parts of itself you
  haven't tried, and hands external agents a routed project context.** Three
  legibility surfaces land together. (1) The `ui/` component kit is now
  self-documenting: each primitive ships a `.doc.ts` object (purpose, props,
  best-practice tenet) compiled into `ui-docs.json` at build time, and two agent
  tools — `ui_search(query)` for a budgeted brief and `ui_get(name)` for
  machine-readable props — let an app-building agent find the right primitive
  instead of hand-rolling chrome; a drift test fails the build if a primitive ships
  without its doc. (2) A **Discover** surface guides you through the parts of
  Gideon you haven't tried yet — a hand-authored catalog of user-facing areas
  (Chat, goal loops, automation, Tasks, Projects, Inbox, Knowledge, Memory, Skills,
  Apps), each a one- or two-sentence lesson with a deep link into the page that owns
  it. It is deliberately NOT tool-derived: the tool surface is an implementation
  detail you're never meant to drive by hand. The dashboard shows a rotating
  spotlight of the first few; a dedicated **Discover hub** (`#/discover`, also in the
  command palette) lists every tip grouped by area. A tip leaves the feed two ways,
  both hide-only: an explicit dismiss that persists forever, and an auto-hide once
  you've actually used that area (detected from state that already exists — a chat on
  disk, a knowledge item, a scheduled job…). It only points and hides, never enables
  anything, and the whole surface is behind the `legibility.discover_tips` config
  flag. (3) Gideon
  can act as a **routed-context provider** for external coding agents: per project it
  assembles a tiered manifest — hard rules/brief at the top, scored memories + skills
  + knowledge *pointers* in the middle, and an L0 catalog of what was NOT loaded (with
  the tool to pull each) at the bottom — exposed as the in-process `get_context` MCP
  tool and, opt-in per project (`legibility.context_adapters`, default off), rendered
  into the project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` inside a
  `<!-- GIDEON:START -->` fence that regenerates in place and never touches your own
  content outside the markers. Memory-derived and knowledge-derived content stay under
  distinct headings, and knowledge items render as titled pointers — never inlined
  bodies. A "Refresh context files" action on the project page (re)writes the block.
- **Apps surface their skills and backend routes to the agent (declared, not
  discovered).** An app now declares two legible surfaces in `app.json`, both
  readable without executing app code. `skills[]` names SKILL.md directories the
  app ships and OWNS: on enable they seed into the user skills tree **through the
  supply-chain chokepoint** (quarantine → scan at the app's trust tier →
  `.gideon-lock.json` provenance) — an app skill never bypasses the gate just
  because it arrived inside an app — and are removed provenance-keyed on disable,
  never touching a user's own or another app's skill. `backend.routes[]` names the
  app's agent-callable HTTP surface (`op`, method, path, summary, param/body
  hints); one generic tool provider turns every enabled app's `agentCallable`
  routes into `app_<name>_<op>` tools (risk keyed off the verb) and drives them
  through the existing loopback reverse proxy, and a `call-app-route` action lets
  hooks/crons fire the same routes — both share one resolver so the callable gate
  can't diverge. The routes also render into `GET /api/manifest`'s `app_surfaces[]`
  (a non-callable route documents the surface with `tool: null`), and a declared
  route whose backend answers 404 raises a one-shot drift notification so a
  dead-declared route is caught the moment it's called. First-party Growth (17
  routes) and Minutes (24 routes) ship their route tables.
- **Offline agent reference + `gideon-api` skill** — an agent driving Gideon
  from outside a running gateway now reads exact tool/route signatures instead of
  guessing them. The distribution ships a generated markdown reference
  (`gideon/reference/`: every registered tool with its input schema +
  examples, the agent-callable HTTP routes, and the provider taxonomy) rendered
  from the same source as the live `GET /api/manifest`, plus a bundled `gideon-api`
  operator skill (the never-guess-copy-it + verify-after-mutate discipline). Locate
  the files from the installed binary with the new `gideon doctor --paths`,
  which prints the resolved reference / config / skills / install directories. A
  drift test byte-compares the checked-in reference against a fresh render, so a
  tool or route added without its metadata reddens the build.
- **Render-smoke gate** (`npm run smoke:render`): the built SPA is now loaded
  in headless Chromium — key routes must mount real content with no uncaught
  errors — before any frontend-affecting push (repository-owned pre-push hook,
  `npm run hooks:install`) and on every PR (CI `web` job). Closes the
  verification hole behind the v0.1.0 blank dashboard, where typecheck, unit
  tests, and the production build all passed without ever rendering the
  artifact in a browser.

### Changed

- **The dashboard's system indicators are now a docked bottom rail.** The System
  strip (uptime, version, CPU/memory/network/disk/load, triggers, subagents, and
  the update action) was the last item in the scrolling column; it's now a
  shell-like rail pinned to the bottom edge, so the live indicators stay visible
  while the rest of the dashboard scrolls. The dashboard header's at-a-glance
  pulse strip sheds two now-redundant indicators: the gateway connectivity pill
  ("Live/Offline") and the gateway-version pill. The app shell's top-right corner
  already carries a live connectivity dot on every page, and its expanded system
  card now shows the gateway version (sourced from `/api/system`) — so the header
  strip is just the live count pills. The rail itself is width-responsive (a CSS
  container query, keyed to the content-width preset + sidebar, not the viewport):
  it sheds the decorative CPU sparkline and the metric word-labels — icon + value
  keep carrying the reading, with the full text on hover — to stay on one line as
  the available width tightens, and the "Details →" action stays anchored to the
  right edge.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Blank dashboard in v0.1.0 (critical).** The released SPA crashed at first
  render with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')`
  — a dependency-group bump had split the installed tree across React 18 and
  React-DOM 19 (the classic dual-React invalid-hook failure), so every install
  kind (pip/uv, container, git) served an empty page. The web toolchain is
  reverted to its known-good React-18 set, a root npm `overrides` pins
  `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom` so transitive packages cannot drag React-19
  types back in, and the lockfile is regenerated from a clean install so the
  declared and resolved trees agree.
- **`monaco-editor` was never declared as a dependency** — it is a peer of
  `@monaco-editor/react` and imported directly, but resolved only by lockfile
  accident; a clean reinstall broke the build. Now a direct dependency
  (`^0.55.1`, the version v0.1.0 shipped transitively).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **App-contributed CLI seams** — an app can now hook into `gideon setup` and
  `gideon doctor` via manifest `cli.setup` / `cli.doctor` (`module:function`),
  and declare its log namespaces via `loggerRoots`. `gideon setup --app <name>`
  runs just one app's setup step. Core names no channel vendor in its CLI.
- **CI & release engineering** — GitHub Actions for both repos: `ci.yml`
  (lint/test/web/rails, ≤10-min budget) and `full.yml` (3.12/3.13 × ubuntu/macos
  matrix, audit, coverage) on core; manifest-validate/tests/boundary on the apps repo.
  A tag-triggered `release.yml` builds the wheel (with the prebuilt SPA) + multi-arch
  GHCR images, publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing behind an owner-approval gate,
  and attaches an SBOM + build-provenance attestations. `uv.lock` pins the dependency
  graph (CI installs `--locked`); Dependabot watches pip/npm/actions weekly. See the
  [supply-chain posture](README.md#supply-chain).

### Changed

- **Provider-boundary completion (Slack residue retired from core):** the Slack
  channel app now ships its own token/slash-command setup and doctor probe (via the
  new `cli.setup`/`cli.doctor` seams) instead of living hardcoded in core's CLI; app
  logger roots are derived from installed manifests (`constants.APP_LOGGER_ROOTS`
  removed); `slack-sdk` is no longer a core runtime dependency (kept as the `[slack]`
  extra, and the slack-channel app declares it via manifest `pythonDependencies`, which
  the app-install pipeline installs). A residue-sweep test + a machine-checked keeps
  table (`docs/architecture/provider-boundary-keeps.txt`) prevent vendor residue from
  regrowing in core.
- **LLM SDKs demoted out of core dependencies (`openai`, `anthropic`):** a bare
  `pip install gideon` no longer pulls the OpenAI or Anthropic SDKs. They now
  ship via (a) the `[openai]` / `[anthropic]` packaging extras for pip/uv users, and
  (b) the branded provider apps' manifest `dependencies.pythonDependencies`, which the
  app-install pipeline installs into the shared venv (plan 32 T2.1). The provider
  adapters import their SDK lazily and now raise a clear `MissingSDKError` naming the
  exact `pip install 'gideon[openai]'` remedy (and `gideon doctor`) when a
  hosted provider is used without its SDK. This trims the default install; users who
  install a provider app or the matching extra are unaffected (plan 34 T1.4).
- **Self-update is now install-kind aware (git · pip · container · desktop):** the
  in-app updater (Settings → Updates) and the update check no longer assume a git
  checkout. The availability signal is the **latest GitHub release tag** (ETag-cached,
  offline-tolerant) compared against the running version — tags are the release truth
  for every install path. Apply adapts to the install kind: a **git** checkout runs the
  existing pull → reinstall → rebuild → restart pipeline (with a new *Developer update
  mode* toggle, `dashboard.update_dev_mode`, to track every commit instead of only
  tagged releases); a **pip/uv/pipx** install runs `pip install -U gideon==<tag>`
  into its own interpreter and gracefully re-execs (no web build — the wheel ships the
  dashboard); a **container** install shows the exact `docker compose … pull && up -d`
  commands (no in-place apply); a **desktop** install delegates to the app shell. The
  Updates panel renders the right affordance per kind, and git installs also surface
  commits-behind as secondary info.

  This is a **clean break** (pre-1.0): the old git-only updater is replaced directly,
  not gated — LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE's gate machinery is deferred, so there is no
  `update_kind_aware` gate to flip (owner decision 2026-07-20). Behavior change: a git
  checkout now updates on new *release tags* by default instead of every commit — flip
  *Developer update mode* on to restore per-commit updates. **Run `gideon
  snapshot` before updating.** (plan 34 S4.)

### Removed

- **`gideon gateway --slack-only`** — the legacy alias for `--headless` is
  removed. Use `--headless`.

### Fixed

- **Release wheel now bundles the SPA when built via `python -m build`.** The release
  pipeline (and `make build`) build the sdist first, then build the wheel from that
  sdist; the built `web/dist` was not included in the sdist, so the wheel-from-sdist
  shipped without the dashboard and failed `scripts/verify_wheel.py`. A new
  `MANIFEST.in` grafts `web/dist` into the sdist, which also makes the sdist itself
  self-contained (a wheel built from the PyPI sdist serves the dashboard too). Guarded
  by `tests/test_sdist_bundles_spa.py`. (plan 34; caught in the release dry-run.)


Initial public release — the first end-to-end Gideon: a self-hosted, local-first,
provider-agnostic personal AI agent behind one gateway and one web dashboard.

### Added

- **Agentic chat** — multi-session chat with tool use and approval controls, session
  forking/undo, answer variants/regenerate, folders/tags/kanban, side conversations,
  per-session model and reasoning-effort overrides, and temporary/incognito memory modes.
- **Goal loops** — give the agent a target; it classifies, plans, and loops autonomously
  under a deterministic supervisor you can pause, nudge, or stop.
- **Memory** — layered semantic/episodic/procedural memory with active recall, after-turn
  learning from corrections, promotion of repeated facts, and an Obsidian-compatible vault.
- **Knowledge base** — document/media/web ingestion, AI enrichment, entity extraction, a
  knowledge graph, and semantic search wired into chat context.
- **Skills** — SKILL.md procedures with a marketplace, supply-chain scanning on install,
  session-scoped ephemeral skills, and an approval inbox for agent-proposed skills.
- **Automation** — cron/interval/webhook triggers, background subagents, a channel-watching
  inbox with drafted replies, and workflow SOPs surfaced on match.
- **App platform** — a permission-gated, scanner-gated Store: model providers, search,
  speech (STT/TTS), local models, channel connectors, agents, and full backend+UI apps,
  each installed through a quarantine → scan → consent lifecycle with subprocess isolation.
- **Agent runtimes** — the built-in native loop plus external CLI agents over ACP
  (Agent Client Protocol) as pluggable runtimes.
- **Model layer** — per-use-case model bindings (chat, background, embedding, ingestion,
  speech) over 16 provider apps; nothing is hardwired to a vendor.
- **Security** — four auth modes (loopback-forced `none`), command screening (denylist +
  suspicious-pattern watchers), an OS child sandbox, one egress chokepoint with host
  policy, untrusted-content fencing, a non-overridable "dangerous" install verdict, an
  HMAC-chained tamper-evident security event log, and credential-excluding exports.
- **Delivery surfaces** — local gateway, Docker Compose, systemd/launchd service install,
  a desktop shell, and portable snapshot/restore.

### Notes

- Single-user, self-hosted, MIT-licensed. **Zero telemetry** — no usage data leaves your
  machine.
- Requires Python 3.12+; a model-provider API key (or a local Ollama) to start chatting.
