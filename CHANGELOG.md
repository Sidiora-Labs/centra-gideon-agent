# Changelog

All notable changes to Gideon are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The in-app Updates panel reads this file (`GET /api/changelog`) to show "what's new."

## [Unreleased]

Forward-looking work is tracked in [docs/roadmap/](docs/roadmap/roadmap.md).

### Added

- **First-party apps now appear in the Store on a plain install.** The published
  first-party apps repository (`github.com/Gideon/GideonApps`) ships as
  a default Store source, so a bare `pip install gideon` surfaces every
  first-party app — model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama, …),
  search, speech, channels — without the dev workspace tree. They appear
  **uninstalled**: nothing runs until you click Install, so the per-app
  install-consent + provider-agnostic-core contracts are unchanged. The source is a
  built-in default (not user-removable); the dev filesystem source and the
  `GIDEON_FIRST_PARTY_APPS_DIR` override still work for offline/local-clone
  development. The Store's catalog scan is cached (5-minute TTL) and runs off the
  event loop, so the first open clones once in the background.
- **Every non-interactive model call now passes through one guarded seam.**
  Background LLM calls (the `reasoning` axis behind `one_shot_completion`, the
  goal-loop judges, the loop gates, web-extract) are now wrapped in a
  **model-call guard** — the LLM twin of the network egress chokepoint. It adds a
  **per-provider circuit breaker** (opens after N consecutive failures, half-opens
  after a recovery window): during a provider outage an overnight run fails in
  microseconds instead of stacking timeouts. It adds a **hard wall-clock timeout**
  on every call, and an **attempt-level JSONL audit trail**
  (`~/.gideon/model_calls.jsonl`, one line per attempt, trimmed to the most
  recent entries) recording provider, model, latency, tokens, and outcome. The
  **interactive chat stream is deliberately untouched** — a human is watching it.
  `one_shot_completion` also gains a typed **`output_type`** option: pass `dict`
  or `list` to require a parseable JSON shape, and a parse miss is retried once
  with a targeted correction note before raising a loud `OutputContractError` —
  replacing the silent `None` degrade that `parse_llm_json` returned at every
  call site (migrated: web-extract, inbox classify). Goal-loop and eval judge
  verdicts gain a bounded **`reasoning`** field written before the verdict, so a
  structured-output constraint no longer suppresses the judge's chain of thought.
  A new graded provider capability descriptor (`structured_output`:
  `none`/`json_mode`/`json_schema`) lets provider apps opt into native
  schema enforcement in a later change; until then every provider gets the
  universal parse-with-retry path. This is a **clean break** (pre-1.0): the new
  audit trail is additive on-disk state under `~/.gideon/` — **run
  `gideon snapshot` before upgrading** if you want a rollback point.
  (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §2, Session 1.)
- **Unattended spend now has budgets, and outbound prompts are scanned for
  secrets.** A new **Guardrails** settings section (`config.json` → `guardrails`)
  adds daily spend ceilings for unattended work: set a **max tokens/day** or
  **max dollars/day** and when the day's automated spend hits the ceiling, further
  unattended LLM calls are refused (a cron agent fire is skipped with a one-time
  "daily automation budget reached" notification, a subagent spawn is refused) —
  interactive chat is never budget-gated. Spend is metered at the model-call seam
  into `~/.gideon/spend.json` (per-day, pruned after 30 days), with dollars
  estimated from the existing per-model price table (provider-reported cost
  preferred). Every outbound prompt bound for a **remote** provider is scanned for
  secrets/PII (AWS keys, private keys, Slack tokens, emails, phone numbers) and
  handled per a configurable **scan mode**: `warn` (log + send), `redact`
  (substitute + send, the default), or `block` (refuse the call); a local provider
  is always `warn` since its content never leaves the machine. The circuit-breaker
  thresholds from Session 1 are now configurable here too (failure threshold,
  recovery seconds). Defaults are **unlimited budget + redact**, so an existing
  install's behavior is unchanged until you set a ceiling. Clean break (pre-1.0):
  additive on-disk state (`spend.json`) — **run `gideon snapshot` before
  upgrading** for a rollback point. (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.1, §2.2, Session 2.)
- **A kill switch, a path/action denylist, and a live-write guard for unattended
  work.** Three safety-floor controls land. (1) **`gideon incident on`** (and
  `POST /api/incident`) suspends every unattended fire — cron, hooks, event
  triggers, subagent spawns — within one poll interval; **interactive chat keeps
  working**, and resuming requires an explicit `gideon incident off` (or
  `POST /api/incident/resume {confirm:true}`). Activation/resume are tamper-evidently
  logged. (2) A **path/action denylist** (`security.autonomy_denylist`, rules of
  `{paths, actions, verdict: block|needs_human}`) is enforced at all three
  action-dispatch seams (script hooks, scheduled jobs, memory-event triggers), so
  an app-contributed action provider inherits it without cooperating; it composes
  with the always-on built-in sensitive-path + destructive-command denylists. A
  `needs_human` rule holds the action and raises a needs-input notification instead
  of dropping it. (3) **`GIDEON_DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES=1`** makes live,
  hard-to-reverse writes (deleting a downloaded model, a non-GET request to a
  non-loopback host) refuse with a loud typed error instead of executing — and it
  is auto-set for the whole test suite, structurally closing the bug class where a
  destructive test once deleted a real bound model. Guard flags parse fail-safe
  (a missing/typo'd value keeps the guard ON), and the outbound scan now defaults
  to `redact` (never the leaky `warn`), enforced by a schema test. Clean break
  (pre-1.0): additive config + an `incident.json` flag file — **run `gideon
  snapshot` before upgrading**. (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §1.2–§1.4, §5, Session 3.)
- **A Guardrails settings surface, a provider-health view, and named safety
  profiles.** The safety floor gets its cockpit and its posture layer. A new
  **Settings → Guardrails** panel gathers the incident kill switch (with a
  one-click toggle), the daily spend budgets, the outbound scan mode, and the
  circuit-breaker tuning — and a **provider-health view** derived from the
  model-call audit (per-provider breaker state, pass rate, p50/p90/p99 latency,
  recent failure modes; `GET /api/models/health`, computed from files already on
  disk — no telemetry). A **persistent incident banner** now shows on every page
  while incident mode is active, with inline Resume. Under the hood, **named safety
  profiles** (`interactive` / `coding` / `review-only` / `cleanup` / `incident` /
  `headless`) become the single object that decides approval + tool grants + egress
  tier + budget + scan for a run; unattended runs (cron, subagents, channel, inbox,
  loop workers) resolve to the read-only **`headless`** profile *by construction*
  from their session key, and a curated **package-registry egress tier** lets a
  sandboxed run reach pypi/npm/crates/GitHub/… without opening the whole internet.
  Defaults preserve today's behavior. Clean break (pre-1.0), additive. (AUTONOMY-
  GUARDRAILS §2.5, §3, §4.2, §4.4, Session 4.)
- **The animated dot-wave backdrop is now a choosable background style.** A new
  **Background** control in Settings → Design → Backdrop & motion switches the
  surface behind chat, the new-chat composer, and onboarding between four modes:
  `waves` (the animated breathing dot-wave surface, default), `still` (the same
  dot field frozen — the lattice without the motion), `glow` (only the soft light
  hugging the composer, no dots), and `none` (a plain, empty canvas). The choice
  persists in your appearance settings and applies live with no reload. Motion
  modes still honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (they render one static frame).
- **Gideon describes its own UI kit, guides you to the parts of itself you
  haven't tried, and hands external agents a routed project context.** Three
  legibility surfaces land together. (1) The `ui/` component kit is now
  self-documenting: each primitive ships a `.doc.ts` object (purpose, props,
  best-practice tenet) compiled into `ui-docs.json` at build time, and two agent
  tools — `ui_search(query)` for a budgeted brief and `ui_get(name)` for
  machine-readable props — let an app-building agent find the right primitive
  instead of hand-rolling chrome; a drift test fails the build if a primitive ships
  without its doc. (2) A **Discover** surface guides you through the parts of
  Gideon you haven't tried yet — a hand-authored catalog of user-facing areas
  (Chat, goal loops, automation, Tasks, Projects, Inbox, Knowledge, Memory, Skills,
  Apps), each a one- or two-sentence lesson with a deep link into the page that owns
  it. It is deliberately NOT tool-derived: the tool surface is an implementation
  detail you're never meant to drive by hand. The dashboard shows a rotating
  spotlight of the first few; a dedicated **Discover hub** (`#/discover`, also in the
  command palette) lists every tip grouped by area. A tip leaves the feed two ways,
  both hide-only: an explicit dismiss that persists forever, and an auto-hide once
  you've actually used that area (detected from state that already exists — a chat on
  disk, a knowledge item, a scheduled job…). It only points and hides, never enables
  anything, and the whole surface is behind the `legibility.discover_tips` config
  flag. (3) Gideon
  can act as a **routed-context provider** for external coding agents: per project it
  assembles a tiered manifest — hard rules/brief at the top, scored memories + skills
  + knowledge *pointers* in the middle, and an L0 catalog of what was NOT loaded (with
  the tool to pull each) at the bottom — exposed as the in-process `get_context` MCP
  tool and, opt-in per project (`legibility.context_adapters`, default off), rendered
  into the project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` inside a
  `<!-- GIDEON:START -->` fence that regenerates in place and never touches your own
  content outside the markers. Memory-derived and knowledge-derived content stay under
  distinct headings, and knowledge items render as titled pointers — never inlined
  bodies. A "Refresh context files" action on the project page (re)writes the block.
- **Apps surface their skills and backend routes to the agent (declared, not
  discovered).** An app now declares two legible surfaces in `app.json`, both
  readable without executing app code. `skills[]` names SKILL.md directories the
  app ships and OWNS: on enable they seed into the user skills tree **through the
  supply-chain chokepoint** (quarantine → scan at the app's trust tier →
  `.gideon-lock.json` provenance) — an app skill never bypasses the gate just
  because it arrived inside an app — and are removed provenance-keyed on disable,
  never touching a user's own or another app's skill. `backend.routes[]` names the
  app's agent-callable HTTP surface (`op`, method, path, summary, param/body
  hints); one generic tool provider turns every enabled app's `agentCallable`
  routes into `app_<name>_<op>` tools (risk keyed off the verb) and drives them
  through the existing loopback reverse proxy, and a `call-app-route` action lets
  hooks/crons fire the same routes — both share one resolver so the callable gate
  can't diverge. The routes also render into `GET /api/manifest`'s `app_surfaces[]`
  (a non-callable route documents the surface with `tool: null`), and a declared
  route whose backend answers 404 raises a one-shot drift notification so a
  dead-declared route is caught the moment it's called. First-party Growth (17
  routes) and Minutes (24 routes) ship their route tables.
- **Offline agent reference + `gideon-api` skill** — an agent driving Gideon
  from outside a running gateway now reads exact tool/route signatures instead of
  guessing them. The distribution ships a generated markdown reference
  (`gideon/reference/`: every registered tool with its input schema +
  examples, the agent-callable HTTP routes, and the provider taxonomy) rendered
  from the same source as the live `GET /api/manifest`, plus a bundled `gideon-api`
  operator skill (the never-guess-copy-it + verify-after-mutate discipline). Locate
  the files from the installed binary with the new `gideon doctor --paths`,
  which prints the resolved reference / config / skills / install directories. A
  drift test byte-compares the checked-in reference against a fresh render, so a
  tool or route added without its metadata reddens the build.
- **Render-smoke gate** (`npm run smoke:render`): the built SPA is now loaded
  in headless Chromium — key routes must mount real content with no uncaught
  errors — before any frontend-affecting push (repository-owned pre-push hook,
  `npm run hooks:install`) and on every PR (CI `web` job). Closes the
  verification hole behind the v0.1.0 blank dashboard, where typecheck, unit
  tests, and the production build all passed without ever rendering the
  artifact in a browser.

### Changed

- **The dashboard's system indicators are now a docked bottom rail.** The System
  strip (uptime, version, CPU/memory/network/disk/load, triggers, subagents, and
  the update action) was the last item in the scrolling column; it's now a
  shell-like rail pinned to the bottom edge, so the live indicators stay visible
  while the rest of the dashboard scrolls. The dashboard header's at-a-glance
  pulse strip sheds two now-redundant indicators: the gateway connectivity pill
  ("Live/Offline") and the gateway-version pill. The app shell's top-right corner
  already carries a live connectivity dot on every page, and its expanded system
  card now shows the gateway version (sourced from `/api/system`) — so the header
  strip is just the live count pills. The rail itself is width-responsive (a CSS
  container query, keyed to the content-width preset + sidebar, not the viewport):
  it sheds the decorative CPU sparkline and the metric word-labels — icon + value
  keep carrying the reading, with the full text on hover — to stay on one line as
  the available width tightens, and the "Details →" action stays anchored to the
  right edge.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Blank dashboard in v0.1.0 (critical).** The released SPA crashed at first
  render with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')`
  — a dependency-group bump had split the installed tree across React 18 and
  React-DOM 19 (the classic dual-React invalid-hook failure), so every install
  kind (pip/uv, container, git) served an empty page. The web toolchain is
  reverted to its known-good React-18 set, a root npm `overrides` pins
  `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom` so transitive packages cannot drag React-19
  types back in, and the lockfile is regenerated from a clean install so the
  declared and resolved trees agree.
- **`monaco-editor` was never declared as a dependency** — it is a peer of
  `@monaco-editor/react` and imported directly, but resolved only by lockfile
  accident; a clean reinstall broke the build. Now a direct dependency
  (`^0.55.1`, the version v0.1.0 shipped transitively).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **App-contributed CLI seams** — an app can now hook into `gideon setup` and
  `gideon doctor` via manifest `cli.setup` / `cli.doctor` (`module:function`),
  and declare its log namespaces via `loggerRoots`. `gideon setup --app <name>`
  runs just one app's setup step. Core names no channel vendor in its CLI.
- **CI & release engineering** — GitHub Actions for both repos: `ci.yml`
  (lint/test/web/rails, ≤10-min budget) and `full.yml` (3.12/3.13 × ubuntu/macos
  matrix, audit, coverage) on core; manifest-validate/tests/boundary on the apps repo.
  A tag-triggered `release.yml` builds the wheel (with the prebuilt SPA) + multi-arch
  GHCR images, publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing behind an owner-approval gate,
  and attaches an SBOM + build-provenance attestations. `uv.lock` pins the dependency
  graph (CI installs `--locked`); Dependabot watches pip/npm/actions weekly. See the
  [supply-chain posture](README.md#supply-chain).

### Changed

- **Provider-boundary completion (Slack residue retired from core):** the Slack
  channel app now ships its own token/slash-command setup and doctor probe (via the
  new `cli.setup`/`cli.doctor` seams) instead of living hardcoded in core's CLI; app
  logger roots are derived from installed manifests (`constants.APP_LOGGER_ROOTS`
  removed); `slack-sdk` is no longer a core runtime dependency (kept as the `[slack]`
  extra, and the slack-channel app declares it via manifest `pythonDependencies`, which
  the app-install pipeline installs). A residue-sweep test + a machine-checked keeps
  table (`docs/architecture/provider-boundary-keeps.txt`) prevent vendor residue from
  regrowing in core.
- **LLM SDKs demoted out of core dependencies (`openai`, `anthropic`):** a bare
  `pip install gideon` no longer pulls the OpenAI or Anthropic SDKs. They now
  ship via (a) the `[openai]` / `[anthropic]` packaging extras for pip/uv users, and
  (b) the branded provider apps' manifest `dependencies.pythonDependencies`, which the
  app-install pipeline installs into the shared venv (plan 32 T2.1). The provider
  adapters import their SDK lazily and now raise a clear `MissingSDKError` naming the
  exact `pip install 'gideon[openai]'` remedy (and `gideon doctor`) when a
  hosted provider is used without its SDK. This trims the default install; users who
  install a provider app or the matching extra are unaffected (plan 34 T1.4).
- **Self-update is now install-kind aware (git · pip · container · desktop):** the
  in-app updater (Settings → Updates) and the update check no longer assume a git
  checkout. The availability signal is the **latest GitHub release tag** (ETag-cached,
  offline-tolerant) compared against the running version — tags are the release truth
  for every install path. Apply adapts to the install kind: a **git** checkout runs the
  existing pull → reinstall → rebuild → restart pipeline (with a new *Developer update
  mode* toggle, `dashboard.update_dev_mode`, to track every commit instead of only
  tagged releases); a **pip/uv/pipx** install runs `pip install -U gideon==<tag>`
  into its own interpreter and gracefully re-execs (no web build — the wheel ships the
  dashboard); a **container** install shows the exact `docker compose … pull && up -d`
  commands (no in-place apply); a **desktop** install delegates to the app shell. The
  Updates panel renders the right affordance per kind, and git installs also surface
  commits-behind as secondary info.

  This is a **clean break** (pre-1.0): the old git-only updater is replaced directly,
  not gated — LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE's gate machinery is deferred, so there is no
  `update_kind_aware` gate to flip (owner decision 2026-07-20). Behavior change: a git
  checkout now updates on new *release tags* by default instead of every commit — flip
  *Developer update mode* on to restore per-commit updates. **Run `gideon
  snapshot` before updating.** (plan 34 S4.)

### Removed

- **`gideon gateway --slack-only`** — the legacy alias for `--headless` is
  removed. Use `--headless`.

### Fixed

- **Release wheel now bundles the SPA when built via `python -m build`.** The release
  pipeline (and `make build`) build the sdist first, then build the wheel from that
  sdist; the built `web/dist` was not included in the sdist, so the wheel-from-sdist
  shipped without the dashboard and failed `scripts/verify_wheel.py`. A new
  `MANIFEST.in` grafts `web/dist` into the sdist, which also makes the sdist itself
  self-contained (a wheel built from the PyPI sdist serves the dashboard too). Guarded
  by `tests/test_sdist_bundles_spa.py`. (plan 34; caught in the release dry-run.)


Initial public release — the first end-to-end Gideon: a self-hosted, local-first,
provider-agnostic personal AI agent behind one gateway and one web dashboard.

### Added

- **Agentic chat** — multi-session chat with tool use and approval controls, session
  forking/undo, answer variants/regenerate, folders/tags/kanban, side conversations,
  per-session model and reasoning-effort overrides, and temporary/incognito memory modes.
- **Goal loops** — give the agent a target; it classifies, plans, and loops autonomously
  under a deterministic supervisor you can pause, nudge, or stop.
- **Memory** — layered semantic/episodic/procedural memory with active recall, after-turn
  learning from corrections, promotion of repeated facts, and an Obsidian-compatible vault.
- **Knowledge base** — document/media/web ingestion, AI enrichment, entity extraction, a
  knowledge graph, and semantic search wired into chat context.
- **Skills** — SKILL.md procedures with a marketplace, supply-chain scanning on install,
  session-scoped ephemeral skills, and an approval inbox for agent-proposed skills.
- **Automation** — cron/interval/webhook triggers, background subagents, a channel-watching
  inbox with drafted replies, and workflow SOPs surfaced on match.
- **App platform** — a permission-gated, scanner-gated Store: model providers, search,
  speech (STT/TTS), local models, channel connectors, agents, and full backend+UI apps,
  each installed through a quarantine → scan → consent lifecycle with subprocess isolation.
- **Agent runtimes** — the built-in native loop plus external CLI agents over ACP
  (Agent Client Protocol) as pluggable runtimes.
- **Model layer** — per-use-case model bindings (chat, background, embedding, ingestion,
  speech) over 16 provider apps; nothing is hardwired to a vendor.
- **Security** — four auth modes (loopback-forced `none`), command screening (denylist +
  suspicious-pattern watchers), an OS child sandbox, one egress chokepoint with host
  policy, untrusted-content fencing, a non-overridable "dangerous" install verdict, an
  HMAC-chained tamper-evident security event log, and credential-excluding exports.
- **Delivery surfaces** — local gateway, Docker Compose, systemd/launchd service install,
  a desktop shell, and portable snapshot/restore.

### Notes

- Single-user, self-hosted, MIT-licensed. **Zero telemetry** — no usage data leaves your
  machine.
- Requires Python 3.12+; a model-provider API key (or a local Ollama) to start chatting.
