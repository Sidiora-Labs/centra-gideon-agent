# Scanner Testing — the Published Adversarial Corpus

The [threat model](threat-model.md) claims that community content is gated at one
chokepoint before it can reach the live skills tree. This document is the evidence
for that claim, and it is deliberately public: the corpus advertises exactly how the
gate is attacked, which is worth more than the obscurity it costs. A control whose
tests nobody can read is a control nobody can audit.

Two things are being tested, and they are not the same thing:

1. **The scanner refuses what it claims to refuse** — five attack classes, each with
   at least one test that fails if the corresponding control stops firing.
2. **The corpus itself is load-bearing** — weaken one control and a corpus test must
   turn red. A suite that stays green against a broken scanner is worse than no
   suite, because it certifies nothing while looking like it does.

Everything below is reproducible from a clean clone with no credentials, no network,
and no vendor SDK.

## How to run it

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov tests/security/
```

`-n 0` is not required — the corpus is parallel-safe — but it keeps the
integrity-race output readable. To run one class:

```bash
python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov tests/security/ -k invisible-char
```

The corpus also runs unattended: `.github/workflows/full.yml` carries a
`security-corpus` job that executes `tests/security/` plus the scanner unit tests on
every nightly `schedule:` run (07:00 UTC), on pushes to `main`, and on
`workflow_dispatch`. It is a separate job so a corpus regression is legible on its
own rather than buried in the full-suite matrix.

## What the corpus is made of

Cases live in `tests/security/corpus/<class>/<case>.json` — one directory per attack
class, one JSON file per case. The harness is
`tests/security/test_scanner_adversarial.py`.

A case is **inert data**, never a program. It describes a payload
(`files[].path` + `files[].contents`, or `variants[]` of script text) and names, in
`expect`, the refusal being asserted. The harness materializes the payload into a
`tmp_path` staging tree and feeds it to the real gate. Nothing under `corpus/` is
executable, and `TestCorpusIsComplete::test_corpus_payloads_are_inert` enforces that
— a non-JSON artifact or an executable bit reds CI.

`expect` is a key into the harness's `HANDLERS` table. A case whose `expect` has no
handler is a fixture nobody asserts on, and
`test_every_case_is_wired_to_an_assertion` reds. This is the corpus's vacuity floor:
an emptied class directory, an orphaned fixture, or a class that quietly stopped
being exercised fails loudly instead of collecting zero tests and reading like a
pass.

## The six attack classes

| Class | The attack | The control that must refuse it |
|---|---|---|
| `archive` | Zip-slip and absolute-path entries, traversal hidden mid-path (`assets/../../..`), and a case-collision pair (`setup.sh` / `SETUP.SH`) whose surviving twin differs by filesystem | `marketplace.py::_stage_files` and `marketplace.py::install_skill_files` both reject `..` and leading `/`; the case-collision pair must reach `DANGEROUS` on a case-sensitive *and* a case-insensitive filesystem |
| `integrity-race` | A source that serves clean bytes to the scan and malicious bytes to a re-fetch; a concurrent writer that rewrites the quarantine directory the moment the scan is done with it; an in-process writer that mutates the payload between scan and commit; bytes edited on disk after a clean install | `marketplace.py::install_scanned` commits the scanned in-memory payload and never re-fetches; `install_skill_files`'s per-file scan catches the in-process mutation; `marketplace.py::verify_skill_integrity` catches the post-install edit against the `_write_lock` baseline |
| `verdict-evasion` | Whitespace and flag-order variants of `rm -rf /`; `base64 -d \| sh`; the read-credentials-then-egress pipeline spread over three lines; **trust-tier laundering** (the same malware declaring `builtin`); `force=True` against the non-overridable floor | `supply_chain.py::_scan_script` patterns, the proximity heuristic in the same function, and `supply_chain.py::SkillScanner._aggregate` — which must never downgrade `DANGEROUS` for any tier |
| `invisible-char` | A bidi override in manifest prose and in a script; a zero-width space inside `rm` that takes the pattern rules out of play | `supply_chain.py::SkillScanner._scan_invisible` — bidi is `DANGEROUS`, zero-width is `WARNING`, and a community install must not proceed on the warning unconfirmed |
| `degenerate-manifest` | A dangerous script padded past the scanner's per-file read cap; frontmatter missing, unclosed, or carrying a name outside the allowed charset; a payload with no `SKILL.md` at all | The oversized blob is skipped by `SkillScanner.scan` (by `supply_chain.py::_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, deliberately — the walk does not read unbounded files) and refused by the uncapped commit-side gate in `install_skill_files`; `marketplace.py::_validate_skill_md` rejects the degenerate manifests |
| `baseline-tamper` | The packaged command denylist itself: a self-consistent rewrite of `baseline_denylist.json` (patterns *and* `sha256` both changed), a digest that disagrees with its patterns, an honest digest over zero patterns, an in-process `.clear()` of the live list, and the no-trusted-source-left state where the live list, the import-time snapshot and the file are all unverifiable at once | `security.py::_read_packaged_baseline` raises on a bad digest or an empty list; `baseline_denied_command_patterns()` heals the live list from the verified snapshot and, when nothing verifies, enforces the *union* rather than shrinking; `verify_baseline_denylist()` compares the file against the fingerprint captured at import and refuses to adopt a divergent one — every branch writing `baseline_denylist_reasserted` or `baseline_denylist_tamper_attempt` to the SEL |

The oversize row is the one worth reading twice. Two controls disagree about the same
bytes: the quarantine walk skips the blob, the commit-side scan refuses it. The
corpus pins **both halves**, so removing the second one — the only control that
actually stops it — reds immediately instead of leaving a size-gated bypass.

`baseline-tamper` is the odd one out and deliberately so: the other five attack an
incoming *artifact*, this one attacks the *denylist that judges it*. Added by **SH-7**
alongside the mode-independence matrix in `tests/security/test_mode_independence.py`,
which proves no approval mode — `default`, `auto`, `yolo`, `acceptEdits` — and no trust
simulator can let a baseline-matched command run. That matrix is worthless if the
baseline can be quietly shortened underneath it, so the two ship together.

Every `baseline-tamper` case asserts the same **triple**, and all three legs matter:

1. **Detected** — `verify_baseline_denylist()` reports `file_verified: false`, or the
   real `_read_packaged_baseline()` raises.
2. **Audited** — the SEL carries exactly one `baseline_denylist_tamper_attempt` (or
   `baseline_denylist_reasserted` for the self-heal case) with the expected
   `metadata.reason`. A tamper that raises but is never logged is invisible.
3. **Still enforcing** — the commands the case names in `variants[]` are *still* refused
   by `denied_command_reason()`, and a benign control is *still* allowed. Without the
   benign half, a build that refused everything would pass leg 3.

The class also drives the tamper through the **real** `_read_packaged_baseline` by
rooting `security.resources` at a temp copy of the data file, rather than substituting a
reader that re-implements the parse. The installed
`src/gideon/baseline_denylist.json` is never written to — the copy lives under
`tmp_path`, and `TestBaselineTamperClass::test_the_tamper_never_touches_the_installed_data_file`
reds if a case ever leaks into the checkout.

## The scanned-bytes == installed-bytes invariant

The sharpest case is not a pattern; it is a swap. If content can change between the
moment it is scanned and the moment it is installed, the verdict describes bytes that
no longer exist.

`install_scanned` closes this by construction: it fetches once, stages to a
quarantine directory, scans that directory, and then commits **the same in-memory
payload it staged**. It never re-reads the staging tree and never re-fetches.

The corpus proves it rather than restating it. The harness wraps
`supply_chain.py::scan_dir` (which `install_scanned` resolves at call time), takes a
per-file sha256 digest of the staging tree *as the scanner sees it*, and compares that
map to a digest of the installed tree afterwards. The assertion is **map equality**,
not "the install succeeded". Alongside it, the fetch counter must read exactly `1`.

The swap is performed from a second thread, joined so the test stays deterministic; a
swap thread that hangs or throws fails the test rather than silently doing nothing.
The three windows an attacker could aim at:

- **Re-fetch.** The hostile source serves malware to fetch #2. The install never makes
  fetch #2, so there is nothing to serve.
- **Quarantine rewrite.** The attacker rewrites the staging tree right after the scan
  reads it. The commit does not read the staging tree, so the installed digest still
  matches the scanned digest.
- **In-memory payload mutation.** The attacker mutates the payload list itself between
  scan and commit — the only window left, and one that requires already executing code
  in the process. The commit-side per-file scan refuses it, so nothing lands.

## Proving the corpus is load-bearing

`TestCorpusRedsOnAWeakenedScanner` weakens one control per class **in process, via
`monkeypatch`**, and asserts the matching corpus rail now fails. The shipped scanner
is never modified, so the demonstration is permanent and reproducible rather than a
branch someone has to remember to delete.

Each row below is also the recipe for reproducing the same result by hand — edit the
file, run the class, watch it red, then restore.

| Weaken this | And this reds |
|---|---|
| Drop `destructive_root` from `supply_chain.py::_DANGEROUS_SCRIPT` | `verdict-evasion/destructive-root-variants` |
| Empty `supply_chain.py::_INVISIBLE_CHARS` | `invisible-char/bidi-override-in-manifest` |
| Make `marketplace.py::_validate_skill_md` return no errors | `degenerate-manifest/missing-frontmatter` |
| Make `marketplace.py::_stage_files` *skip* an unsafe path instead of raising | `archive/zip-slip-parent-escape` |
| Have the commit write anything other than the scanned bytes | `integrity-race/refetch-swap` |
| Rebind `security.py::_BASELINE_SHA256` to the tampered file's own digest | `baseline-tamper/self-consistent-file-rewrite` |
| Make `security.py::_note_baseline_tamper` always return `False` | `baseline-tamper/snapshot-and-file-both-rebound` |

The last two are chosen for a reason. The archive weakness is the plausible one — a
gate that quietly drops the bad entry and installs the rest, which looks like
robustness and is a bypass. And the integrity mutation is **not malicious**: it
appends a comment. Byte equality catches a post-scan substitution even when the
substituted bytes would pass the scan, which a verdict-only assertion never could.

The two `baseline-tamper` rows split detection from audit on purpose. Rebinding the
fingerprint is the exact bug the class exists to catch — a module that re-derives its
fingerprint from the file it is verifying will happily adopt a self-consistent rewrite.
Suppressing `_note_baseline_tamper` leaves detection *and* enforcement intact and only
removes the audit trail; that is still a failure, so the rail must red on it rather than
only on a shrink.

## Execution-reachability scoping of the `DANGEROUS` band

The `DANGEROUS` rules match a string *shape* and are blind to whether anything executes
that string. A bundle whose test fixture holds a real attack string — the string that
proves its input validation refuses the attack — was therefore judged identically to a
bundle that runs it. `DANGEROUS` is terminal and non-consentable, so the fixture
permanently blocked the install: two first-party bundles could not be installed at all,
while a bundle that never tested its validation shipped clean. The rule as written taught
authors to delete their adversarial tests or obfuscate the strings until the scanner
stopped recognising them.

`supply_chain.py` closes that with a second pass that asks a narrower question: **can
this matched literal be executed at all, anywhere in this bundle?** Only on a positive
answer of *no* is the finding re-scored — to `WARNING`, never lower, never dropped, with
rule, path, surface and evidence intact, so the user is still told and still consents.

The predicate is stated on the AST and **never on a filename**. That is the whole basis
of it: "skip test files" would create a place to park a payload, whereas "nothing here
can execute this" cannot — parking a payload requires something that executes it.
Renaming a payload `test_evil.py` therefore buys an attacker nothing, and the attack
table in `tests/security/test_scanner_reachability.py` asserts exactly that.

Five conjunctive clauses, default-deny. Fail any one — or fail to *evaluate* one — and
the finding stays `DANGEROUS`:

| Clause | What must hold | What it closes |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** literal, not code | The file parses as Python and *every* match of this rule lies wholly inside a `str` constant | A shell script (its text is its program); a payload in a comment; a second, live occurrence of the same shape that the scanner did not report |
| **L2** no execution sink | The file contains no `os.system`/`popen`/`exec*`/`spawn*`/`fork`, no `eval`/`exec`/`compile`/`__import__`, no `subprocess` call whose `shell` is other than a literal `False`, and every spawn site's argv[0] is a literal non-shell, non-interpreter, non-path program | The literal being handed to an interpreter — **including after being concatenated into a larger string**, which is why the clause is stated at module scope rather than on the literal's argument position |
| **L3** no export | No other module imports it, no sibling names its file or stem in a string, no script or config mentions it, `app.json` does not declare it | Another file lifting the literal out. Prose is excluded on purpose: a README saying "run pytest test_provider.py" is documentation |
| **L4** the graph is trustworthy | No `eval`/`exec`/`compile`/`__import__`/`importlib`/`runpy`/`pickle`/`marshal`/`ctypes`, no computed `getattr`, no `import *`, no `sys.path` mutation, and no Python or loader file the walk could not read — anywhere in the bundle | L3 is a static claim; a bundle that can rewrite its own import graph, or a file nobody could read, makes it worthless |
| **L5** importing it is a no-op | The module's top level calls nothing outside a small pure allowlist | The payload firing on import — unreachable is not never-imported |

A file that does not parse is reported as its **own** outcome
(`Reachability.UNPARSEABLE`), distinct from both `REACHABLE` and `UNREACHABLE`, and
treated exactly like `REACHABLE`. "We could not tell" must never render as "safe".
`scan_text` gets no scoping at all: a bare blob has no bundle around it, so
non-reachability cannot be proved and the default-deny answer stands.

Re-measure any checkout of bundles with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src:. python tools/measure_scanner_scope.py /path/to/GideonApps
```

Every re-scored finding prints the clauses that granted it, so a downgrade nobody can
check is not possible.

### Proving each clause is load-bearing

`TestRedsOnAWeakenedCheck` in `tests/security/test_scanner_reachability.py` neuters one
clause at a time, in process via `monkeypatch`, and asserts the matching rail fails.
Each row is also the recipe for reproducing it by hand.

| Weaken this | And this reds |
|---|---|
| Replace `supply_chain.py::_scope_by_reachability` with the identity | the two blocked bundle shapes become uninstallable again |
| Widen L1's `str_spans` to the whole file | `payload in a comment, which is not rescued` |
| Clear L2's `_FileFacts.sinks` | `payload built at runtime and then executed`, and `payload passed straight to os.system` |
| Stub L3's `_BundleReach._referenced_elsewhere` to `None` | `inert payload module that the provider imports` |
| Clear L4's `_FileFacts.dynamic` | `inert payload module in a bundle that imports importlib` |
| Clear L5's `_FileFacts.top_level_calls` | `inert-looking payload module that runs code on import` |
| Report a parse failure as a parsed file with a whole-file span | the unparseable-file rail |
| Force `_BundleReach.decide` to answer `UNREACHABLE` | every `verdict-evasion` corpus case |

The L2 rows are the ones worth reading twice, and they are split for a reason. The
simple shape — the literal sitting in the sink's own argument list — is not the shape
that decides the design. The deciding shape is a literal that is *never* an argument to
anything: it is concatenated into a command at runtime and that result is executed. A
check that asked "is this literal passed to a sink?" clears that file. Asking instead
"can this file hand *any* string to an interpreter?" does not, which is why the clause
is stated at module scope and why both shapes are pinned separately.

## The terminal band is not shell-only: native destruction

Everything above is about **precision** — not refusing benign content. The other direction
has its own rail, `tests/security/test_scanner_recall.py`, because nothing asserted the
scanner still *catches* anything and the terminal band could have rotted to nothing with
every suite green. It had: `destructive_root` could not fire inside a quoted string for as
long as it had shipped, and the entire band was shell syntax, so destruction written in the
language bundles are actually written in scored **`clean`, with zero findings** (#2607).

Three rules close that, all at the same non-overridable severity as the shell rules —
destruction is destruction, and the language it is spelled in is not the question:

| Rule | The claim it makes |
|---|---|
| `destructive_delete` | A removal call (`shutil.rmtree`, `os.remove`/`unlink`/`rmdir`/`removedirs`, `Path.unlink`/`rmdir`) whose target is the filesystem root, the account root, or an OS-owned tree |
| `destructive_walk` | An **unbounded recursive** walk (`rglob`, `glob("**/…")`, `os.walk`, `glob.glob(recursive=True)`) rooted at one of those, with a removal call inside the loop or comprehension |
| `destructive_truncate` | A truncating write (`open(…, "w")`, `Path.write_text`/`write_bytes`, `Path.open("w")`, `os.truncate`) to an OS-owned path |

Two design choices carry the whole family.

**Decided on the `ast`, never on the text.** These are call sites, and a text scan cannot
tell a call from a mention. `shutil.rmtree` appears in prose, in a comment warning against
it, in a test asserting it is never called, and in denylists of forbidden writers — one
shipped bundle carries exactly such a list. `ast` does not have to guess. Import aliases
are resolved, so `import shutil as sh` and `from shutil import rmtree as rt` are not ways
out, and a name the file binds **exactly once** is followed one hop, so the two-line
`home = expanduser("~"); rmtree(home)` spelling is not either. A file that does not parse
yields nothing here — the text catalogs still judge every byte of it. The family runs on any
script surface whose extension does not name **another** language, so an extension-less
`scripts/setup` is covered and a `.js` file is not: requiring a `.py` suffix would itself be a
parking spot, and every other `_SCRIPT_EXTS` member has syntax `ast.parse` refuses anyway.

**The severity turns on the TARGET, not the call.** `shutil.rmtree` is legitimate; all nine
of its call sites across the 64 shipped bundles pass a variable holding a staging directory,
and refusing the call would refuse them all. So the line is the one the shell band already
draws between `rm -rf /tmp/build` and `rm -rf /`: root, home and the OS-owned trees are
terminal, while `/tmp`, `/var/folders`, `/dev/null`, `~/.cache/…` and **any target the
analysis cannot resolve** are not. That last clause is a recall limit, and it is why
promoting this class to terminal blocks nothing that ships today.

**It goes through the reachability pass, not around it**, and the answer differs by
direction on purpose. A live call reports `reachable` with the reason "a call is code" —
L0/L1 ask whether the match is commentary or a string the file merely holds, and a call
site is neither, so no clause can lower it. The *same text* commented out or quoted in a
docstring produces **no finding at all**, which is stricter than the consentable `WARNING`
a re-scored regex match earns: `ast.parse` discards commentary before the rule can see it,
so there is nothing left to re-score.

### Proving the native rules are load-bearing

`TestRedsOnAWeakenedNativeRule` monkeypatches one control at a time in process. The table
below is the stronger form — each row was applied to the **shipped source** with every
`__pycache__` deleted between runs, because `python -B` is not sufficient: it stops
*writing* bytecode but still *reads* a stale cache, and a same-length edit reverted inside
one second is masked by `(mtime, size)` validation. All 24 red.

| Weaken this | And this reds |
|---|---|
| `_scan_native_destruction` returns `[]` | every native payload |
| Empty `_HOME_LITERALS` / `_HOME_ENV_KEYS` | the `~` and the `os.environ["HOME"]` payloads |
| Drop the `_DRIVE_ROOT_RE` check | the bare-`C:\` payload |
| Stop consulting `_SYSTEM_TREES` | the truncating write and the `/usr` removal |
| Stop consulting `_TRANSIENT_PATHS` | the precision floor — `open("/dev/null", "w")` becomes terminal |
| Empty `_DELETE_FUNCS` / `_DELETE_METHODS` / `_WALK_METHODS` / `_OPEN_FUNCS` | the removal, walk and truncate payloads respectively |
| `_import_aliases` returns `{}` | the `import shutil as sh` and `from shutil import rmtree as rt` payloads |
| `_single_bindings` returns `{}` | the one-line-indirection payload |
| `_classify_path_literal` returns `None` | every native payload |
| Stop unwrapping `_PATH_PASSTHROUGH` | every payload that spells its target as `Path("/")` |
| Stop resolving `..` segments | the `/tmp/..` escape |
| Match `_longest_root` without a path boundary | the precision floor — `/optimized/report.txt` becomes terminal |
| `_truncating_mode` returns `True` | the precision floor — reading and appending become terminal |
| `_deletes_within` returns `True` | the precision floor — walking the root and printing becomes terminal |
| Force the `.glob` branch's `**` check true | the precision floor — a single-level glob becomes a tree sweep |
| Let a `glob.glob` pattern with nothing before its first `*` fall back to `/` | the precision floor — a relative `.pyc` cleanup loop becomes terminal |
| Drop the language gate entirely | the precision floor — a `.js` file is judged by Python rules |
| Require a `.py` SUFFIX rather than "not another language" | the extension-less payload — `scripts/setup` with a python shebang |
| Force `_BundleReach.decide` to answer `UNREACHABLE` for the family | every native payload becomes a consentable warning |
| Add a native rule without a gloss | the plain-language-gloss rail |

Four of those rows exist **because** something survived. Dropping the drive-root check and
forcing the `**` check true both survived the whole suite on the first pass, so each is now
pinned by a fixture. The relative-glob row was a real false positive found by re-reading the
branch: a pattern with nothing before its first `*` is relative to the working directory, and
reading it as `/` made `glob.glob("**/*.pyc", recursive=True)` + `os.remove(p)` terminal. The
suffix row is the mirror image — a recall hole rather than a false positive: gating on a `.py`
SUFFIX left `scripts/setup` with a python shebang unscanned, which is a payload parking spot,
so the gate asks "is this some OTHER language?" instead. And one mutation found dead code — a
literal set of root spellings POSIX normalisation already reached — which was deleted rather
than tested.

## Residual risks

The corpus pins what holds. These are the gaps it also pins, honestly, so they are
auditable rather than invisible. They are accepted, not unnoticed.

- **A destructive target the analysis cannot resolve is not flagged.** The native family
  classifies a target it can name — a literal, a path wrapper around one, `Path.home()`,
  `os.environ["HOME"]`, or a name the file binds exactly once. A target assembled at
  runtime, read from config, passed in as a parameter, or held in a name the file rebinds
  resolves to nothing and earns nothing. That is deliberate, and it is the direction that
  costs recall rather than precision, which is the right way round for a band that blocks
  installs outright — but it means `shutil.rmtree(sys.argv[1])` is not terminal.
- **`rm -rf /` handed to a shell is still the shell band's problem.** Two spellings stay
  open and are pinned as strict `xfail`: `os.system("rm -" + "rf /")` and
  `subprocess.run(["rm", "-rf", "/"])`. The native rules do not reach them, and that is not
  a technicality — the destructive call is the spawned `rm`'s, so there is no Python call
  site naming a target to classify. Closing them wants the same AST treatment applied to
  the *arguments* of an execution sink, which is a different rule.
- **An unreferenced module of pure inert data becomes consentable rather than refused.**
  A bundle can ship a file containing nothing but a literal attack string, referenced by
  nothing, and get `WARNING` where it previously got `DANGEROUS`. That is a real
  reduction in the floor for that one shape, and every route out of the file is closed by
  a clause and tested — but "nothing in *this* bundle can reach it" is not "nothing can
  ever reach it". The counterweight is measured, not asserted: the `DANGEROUS` band is a
  literal matcher, so the same attacker already gets **`clean`** from
  `P = "rm -" + "rf / "` and only **`warning`** from a live `os.system("rm -rf /")`. The
  capability given up is refusing the attacker who wrote the payload plainly *and* left
  it unreachable *and* did not obfuscate it — and even they get the finding, the rule id,
  the evidence, and a required click. Scoping does **not** address the false-negative
  side, and should not be read as doing so.

- **Zero-width splitting degrades `DANGEROUS` to `WARNING`.** A zero-width space
  inside `rm` defeats the destructive-root regex; the invisible-codepoint rule still
  fires, so a community install refuses without an explicit override. But a warning is
  overridable by design, so `force=True` installs it — and on a source the owner has
  declared `official` or `trusted`, `_aggregate` lowers that warning to `low` and the
  install proceeds. The corpus asserts the refusal *and* the forced install, and
  checks that `.pclaw-lock.json` records `verdict: warning`, so the override leaves a
  trace. Trust tiers are owner-declared provenance; a control that ignored them would
  make the tier meaningless.
- **A warning-band in-process payload swap.** The commit-side scan refuses only
  `DANGEROUS`, so an adversary already executing code inside the process could swap in
  warning-band bytes and break byte equality. This sits below the boundary — an
  attacker who can mutate a live Python list has no need of the skill installer. See
  the [limitations](limitations.md) note on an already-compromised host.
- **Static inspection is not containment.** The scanner reads text; it does not run
  anything in a sandbox. A payload that is dangerous only at runtime, or through a
  dependency it fetches later, is outside what any pattern gate can see.
- **Binary entries are not scanned.** A payload entry carrying `data` (bytes) has no
  scannable text; its provenance is the sha256 in `.pclaw-lock.json` and nothing more.

## Adding a case

1. Drop a JSON file in `tests/security/corpus/<class>/`. Required keys: `id` (prefixed
   with the class), `class`, `summary`, `expect`, and either `files` or `variants`.
2. Point `expect` at an existing handler, or write a new one and register it in
   `HANDLERS`. An unregistered `expect` reds — deliberately.
3. Run `python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov tests/security/`.
4. If the new case reveals a real bypass, it is a finding: fix the control in the same
   change, or record it under **Residual risks** above with the reasoning. A corpus
   case is never weakened to make the suite green.
