# Scanner Testing — the Published Adversarial Corpus

The [threat model](threat-model.md) claims that community content is gated at one
chokepoint before it can reach the live skills tree. This document is the evidence
for that claim, and it is deliberately public: the corpus advertises exactly how the
gate is attacked, which is worth more than the obscurity it costs. A control whose
tests nobody can read is a control nobody can audit.

Two things are being tested, and they are not the same thing:

1. **The scanner refuses what it claims to refuse** — five attack classes, each with
   at least one test that fails if the corresponding control stops firing.
2. **The corpus itself is load-bearing** — weaken one control and a corpus test must
   turn red. A suite that stays green against a broken scanner is worse than no
   suite, because it certifies nothing while looking like it does.

Everything below is reproducible from a clean clone with no credentials, no network,
and no vendor SDK.

## How to run it

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov tests/security/
```

`-n 0` is not required — the corpus is parallel-safe — but it keeps the
integrity-race output readable. To run one class:

```bash
python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov tests/security/ -k invisible-char
```

The corpus also runs unattended: `.github/workflows/full.yml` carries a
`security-corpus` job that executes `tests/security/` plus the scanner unit tests on
every nightly `schedule:` run (07:00 UTC), on pushes to `main`, and on
`workflow_dispatch`. It is a separate job so a corpus regression is legible on its
own rather than buried in the full-suite matrix.

## What the corpus is made of

Cases live in `tests/security/corpus/<class>/<case>.json` — one directory per attack
class, one JSON file per case. The harness is
`tests/security/test_scanner_adversarial.py`.

A case is **inert data**, never a program. It describes a payload
(`files[].path` + `files[].contents`, or `variants[]` of script text) and names, in
`expect`, the refusal being asserted. The harness materializes the payload into a
`tmp_path` staging tree and feeds it to the real gate. Nothing under `corpus/` is
executable, and `TestCorpusIsComplete::test_corpus_payloads_are_inert` enforces that
— a non-JSON artifact or an executable bit reds CI.

`expect` is a key into the harness's `HANDLERS` table. A case whose `expect` has no
handler is a fixture nobody asserts on, and
`test_every_case_is_wired_to_an_assertion` reds. This is the corpus's vacuity floor:
an emptied class directory, an orphaned fixture, or a class that quietly stopped
being exercised fails loudly instead of collecting zero tests and reading like a
pass.

## The five attack classes

| Class | The attack | The control that must refuse it |
|---|---|---|
| `archive` | Zip-slip and absolute-path entries, traversal hidden mid-path (`assets/../../..`), and a case-collision pair (`setup.sh` / `SETUP.SH`) whose surviving twin differs by filesystem | `marketplace.py::_stage_files` and `marketplace.py::install_skill_files` both reject `..` and leading `/`; the case-collision pair must reach `DANGEROUS` on a case-sensitive *and* a case-insensitive filesystem |
| `integrity-race` | A source that serves clean bytes to the scan and malicious bytes to a re-fetch; a concurrent writer that rewrites the quarantine directory the moment the scan is done with it; an in-process writer that mutates the payload between scan and commit; bytes edited on disk after a clean install | `marketplace.py::install_scanned` commits the scanned in-memory payload and never re-fetches; `install_skill_files`'s per-file scan catches the in-process mutation; `marketplace.py::verify_skill_integrity` catches the post-install edit against the `_write_lock` baseline |
| `verdict-evasion` | Whitespace and flag-order variants of `rm -rf /`; `base64 -d \| sh`; the read-credentials-then-egress pipeline spread over three lines; **trust-tier laundering** (the same malware declaring `builtin`); `force=True` against the non-overridable floor | `supply_chain.py::_scan_script` patterns, the proximity heuristic in the same function, and `supply_chain.py::SkillScanner._aggregate` — which must never downgrade `DANGEROUS` for any tier |
| `invisible-char` | A bidi override in manifest prose and in a script; a zero-width space inside `rm` that takes the pattern rules out of play | `supply_chain.py::SkillScanner._scan_invisible` — bidi is `DANGEROUS`, zero-width is `WARNING`, and a community install must not proceed on the warning unconfirmed |
| `degenerate-manifest` | A dangerous script padded past the scanner's per-file read cap; frontmatter missing, unclosed, or carrying a name outside the allowed charset; a payload with no `SKILL.md` at all | The oversized blob is skipped by `SkillScanner.scan` (by `supply_chain.py::_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, deliberately — the walk does not read unbounded files) and refused by the uncapped commit-side gate in `install_skill_files`; `marketplace.py::_validate_skill_md` rejects the degenerate manifests |

The oversize row is the one worth reading twice. Two controls disagree about the same
bytes: the quarantine walk skips the blob, the commit-side scan refuses it. The
corpus pins **both halves**, so removing the second one — the only control that
actually stops it — reds immediately instead of leaving a size-gated bypass.

## The scanned-bytes == installed-bytes invariant

The sharpest case is not a pattern; it is a swap. If content can change between the
moment it is scanned and the moment it is installed, the verdict describes bytes that
no longer exist.

`install_scanned` closes this by construction: it fetches once, stages to a
quarantine directory, scans that directory, and then commits **the same in-memory
payload it staged**. It never re-reads the staging tree and never re-fetches.

The corpus proves it rather than restating it. The harness wraps
`supply_chain.py::scan_dir` (which `install_scanned` resolves at call time), takes a
per-file sha256 digest of the staging tree *as the scanner sees it*, and compares that
map to a digest of the installed tree afterwards. The assertion is **map equality**,
not "the install succeeded". Alongside it, the fetch counter must read exactly `1`.

The swap is performed from a second thread, joined so the test stays deterministic; a
swap thread that hangs or throws fails the test rather than silently doing nothing.
The three windows an attacker could aim at:

- **Re-fetch.** The hostile source serves malware to fetch #2. The install never makes
  fetch #2, so there is nothing to serve.
- **Quarantine rewrite.** The attacker rewrites the staging tree right after the scan
  reads it. The commit does not read the staging tree, so the installed digest still
  matches the scanned digest.
- **In-memory payload mutation.** The attacker mutates the payload list itself between
  scan and commit — the only window left, and one that requires already executing code
  in the process. The commit-side per-file scan refuses it, so nothing lands.

## Proving the corpus is load-bearing

`TestCorpusRedsOnAWeakenedScanner` weakens one control per class **in process, via
`monkeypatch`**, and asserts the matching corpus rail now fails. The shipped scanner
is never modified, so the demonstration is permanent and reproducible rather than a
branch someone has to remember to delete.

Each row below is also the recipe for reproducing the same result by hand — edit the
file, run the class, watch it red, then restore.

| Weaken this | And this reds |
|---|---|
| Drop `destructive_root` from `supply_chain.py::_DANGEROUS_SCRIPT` | `verdict-evasion/destructive-root-variants` |
| Empty `supply_chain.py::_INVISIBLE_CHARS` | `invisible-char/bidi-override-in-manifest` |
| Make `marketplace.py::_validate_skill_md` return no errors | `degenerate-manifest/missing-frontmatter` |
| Make `marketplace.py::_stage_files` *skip* an unsafe path instead of raising | `archive/zip-slip-parent-escape` |
| Have the commit write anything other than the scanned bytes | `integrity-race/refetch-swap` |

The last two are chosen for a reason. The archive weakness is the plausible one — a
gate that quietly drops the bad entry and installs the rest, which looks like
robustness and is a bypass. And the integrity mutation is **not malicious**: it
appends a comment. Byte equality catches a post-scan substitution even when the
substituted bytes would pass the scan, which a verdict-only assertion never could.

## Residual risks

The corpus pins what holds. These are the gaps it also pins, honestly, so they are
auditable rather than invisible. They are accepted, not unnoticed.

- **Zero-width splitting degrades `DANGEROUS` to `WARNING`.** A zero-width space
  inside `rm` defeats the destructive-root regex; the invisible-codepoint rule still
  fires, so a community install refuses without an explicit override. But a warning is
  overridable by design, so `force=True` installs it — and on a source the owner has
  declared `official` or `trusted`, `_aggregate` lowers that warning to `low` and the
  install proceeds. The corpus asserts the refusal *and* the forced install, and
  checks that `.pclaw-lock.json` records `verdict: warning`, so the override leaves a
  trace. Trust tiers are owner-declared provenance; a control that ignored them would
  make the tier meaningless.
- **A warning-band in-process payload swap.** The commit-side scan refuses only
  `DANGEROUS`, so an adversary already executing code inside the process could swap in
  warning-band bytes and break byte equality. This sits below the boundary — an
  attacker who can mutate a live Python list has no need of the skill installer. See
  the [limitations](limitations.md) note on an already-compromised host.
- **Static inspection is not containment.** The scanner reads text; it does not run
  anything in a sandbox. A payload that is dangerous only at runtime, or through a
  dependency it fetches later, is outside what any pattern gate can see.
- **Binary entries are not scanned.** A payload entry carrying `data` (bytes) has no
  scannable text; its provenance is the sha256 in `.pclaw-lock.json` and nothing more.

## Adding a case

1. Drop a JSON file in `tests/security/corpus/<class>/`. Required keys: `id` (prefixed
   with the class), `class`, `summary`, `expect`, and either `files` or `variants`.
2. Point `expect` at an existing handler, or write a new one and register it in
   `HANDLERS`. An unregistered `expect` reds — deliberately.
3. Run `python -m pytest -n 0 --no-cov tests/security/`.
4. If the new case reveals a real bypass, it is a finding: fix the control in the same
   change, or record it under **Residual risks** above with the reasoning. A corpus
   case is never weakened to make the suite green.
