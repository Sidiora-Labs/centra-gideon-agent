# The provider boundary: what belongs in core, and why

Gideon's central architectural tenet is that **the core package is
provider-agnostic**. Core contains capability-enabling mechanisms (protocols,
registries, resolvers). Every integration with a *specific* provider, meaning a
vendor's endpoints, auth, catalogs, binaries or wire quirks, lives in an app
bundle. This document records where the line is drawn and, for each surface that
*looks* vendor-flavoured but stays in core, why that judgment was made.

Runtime source lives under `runtime/gideon/`. Application bundle locations come
from the operator-configured catalogue or a local checkout; the repository `apps/`
contains the console and native shells. The bundle-relative examples below do not
designate a public application repository.

## Why a boundary at all

The boundary is what makes the system composable: any model provider, channel,
agent runtime or search engine can be added by installing an app, with no core
edits. It also keeps core testable in isolation, since the core test suite
collects and passes without the sibling `apps/` directory present, and it keeps
vendor-specific dependencies (SDKs, scrapers, block-format builders) out of the
core dependency set. Apps import core **only** through the `gideon.sdk.*` facade
(26 modules), enforced by `checks/runtime/test_apps_import_boundary.py`.

## The boundary-judgment table

Not everything with a vendor's name in it is drift. Some surfaces are *protocol*
or *reference data* that core must own to function. Each row below is a
deliberate, documented judgment, also recorded in-module at each site.

| Surface | Home | Judgment |
|---|---|---|
| `llm/anthropic.py`, `llm/openai.py` | core | **Wire-protocol clients only.** They speak the Anthropic/OpenAI HTTP message formats, formats many providers reuse. Neither module calls `register_type` at import; registration is owned by `apps/anthropic-models/provider.py` and `apps/openai-models/provider.py`. Core ships the client; an app decides it is *used*. |
| `stt/`, `tts/`, `image_gen/` `openai_provider.py` | core | **OpenAI-*compatible* protocol clients.** The `/v1/audio`, `/v1/images` shapes are a de-facto protocol implemented by many vendors. Vendor **catalogs** (which model ids exist, their properties) are contributed by apps via the `media_catalogs.py` catalog-contribution seam, and `apps/openai-models` owns the OpenAI ones. |
| `acp/dialect.py` (`ClaudeCodeDialect`, `CodexDialect`) | core | **Protocol-shape strategies**, not vendor logic. They encode the small frame-shape differences between the Zed-maintained ACP adapters. App bundles select a dialect by id (`options["dialect"]`); nothing in core infers a vendor from argv or binary names. |
| `llm/catalog.py` family map + `infer_capabilities()` | core | **Fallback-only reference data.** Providers that *declare* capabilities always win; the vendor-name markers only classify unknown models discovered via `/v1/models`. Same class as public model-pricing tables (`pricing.py`, `model_pricing.json`): data about the world, not an integration. |
| `security.py` `xox[bpas]-` token patterns; `sandbox.py` `SLACK_*` env denylist | core | **Secret-detection data.** These patterns exist to *redact and block* leaked credentials. Renaming them to something generic would break the control they implement. Deliberate keep. |
| `CRED_SLACK_*` constants | core `config/loader.py`, re-exported by `packages/python-client/channel.py` | The literal `.env` credential-store key names (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`) that existing installs already hold. The loader is the credential store's home, the bottom layer below all apps, and `packages/python-client/channel.py` re-exports them as the app-facing surface, so the slack app imports via the SDK and no import direction is inverted. Renaming the keys would break existing installs for zero gain. |
| `constants.APP_LOGGER_ROOTS` (`"slack_runtime"`) | core | The list of app logger namespaces the CLI log setup (`cli.py`) and the dashboard log-level handler consume. Apps *registering* their own logger roots, instead of core listing them, is a post-publication roadmap item, deliberately not built yet. |
| Everything else vendor-specific | `apps/` bundles | Endpoints, auth flows, catalogs, binary resolution, block/attachment formats, scraping: all bundle-resident. |

## The app-bundle landscape

The families an app can belong to are not a list this document keeps. They are
exactly `PROVIDER_TYPES` (`apps/manifest.py`), which a manifest is validated
against at install time. Read that frozenset for accepted capabilities, and the
operator-configured application catalogue for available implementations. A
catalogue entry is not evidence that an integration is installed or qualified.
The boundary inside each family is:

- **Model providers** come in three construction shapes, all bundle-resident:
  protocol-thin branded apps (built on `packages/python-client/provider_helpers.py`
  `register_branded_app`), generic-endpoint apps taking a base URL, and
  full-protocol apps owning their own wire translation. Local-inference apps
  (whisper, TTS, embeddings, diarization) additionally implement the
  `local_models/` management contract.
- **Search providers** register through `search_providers/`; the zero-config floor
  is a declared `keyless` *capability*, not a vendor name in core
  (`search_providers/registry.py::_keyless_provider`: the first registered keyless
  provider wins).
- **Agent apps** own binary resolution, dialect selection and login argv; core
  `acp/` is the vendor-neutral protocol layer.
- **Channel apps** own the vendor transport and delivery both ways.
  `slack-channel` is the completed reference: see
  [INBOX_CHANNELS.md](INBOX_CHANNELS.md) and
  [BUILD_A_CHANNEL_APP.md](../guides/BUILD_A_CHANNEL_APP.md).
- **`skills-sh`** is a marketplace app rather than a single provider, and
  **backend+UI apps** contribute their own dashboard pages behind a `ui` block
  plus a subprocess backend.

## How resolution works (no vendor names in the path)

1. **Bindings**: `~/.gideon/active_models.json` maps *use cases*
   (chat, background, embedding, ingestion, stt, tts, …) to an ordered list of
   provider/model refs; the first resolvable ref wins.
2. **Build**: `llm/registry.py` `registry.build` constructs the client via the
   factory the owning app registered with `register_type`. A per-session `model`
   override kwarg is threaded through and honored by every factory.
3. **Catalog and management**: `ModelCatalog`/`ModelManager` is the shared
   catalog and management seam; provider instances live in `config.json`
   `providers[]` (credential-chain providers store no secret material there).
4. **Local models**: `local_models/provider.py` defines the unified
   `LocalModel`/`LocalModelProvider` contract (list/download/delete plus
   gated/source metadata), orthogonal to the inference ABCs. Download detection
   must probe every filesystem layout a provider writes; deletes clear all
   layouts; and a binding to a catalog-absent model surfaces as a synthetic
   not-downloaded row rather than disappearing.
5. **Subscription credentials**: a provider whose vendor bills by subscription
   has no API key to paste; it rides an agent CLI the user already signed in.
   `llm/subscription_credentials.py` knows how to read a *declared* credential
   store read-only and nothing else: the app registers a `SubscriptionSource`
   (paths, JSON key walk, expiry shape, and its own `login_hint` naming its own
   login verb) and names it in `BrandedProviderSpec.credential_source`. **Core
   ships no source rows**; do not add one, because a vendor path or login verb in
   core is the boundary violation, not a shortcut. The resolver sits at one fixed
   place in the credential order (below `entry.credential` and `options.api_key`,
   above `spec.api_key_env`), never writes or refreshes the store it reads, and
   reports not-signed-in through the `availability()` probe `providers/loader.py`
   derives from that declaration.

## Case study: how Slack left core

The clearest illustration of the tenet is the Slack extraction, originally
13,097 LOC across 11 core modules. The end state:

- **Core kept the seams**: `channel_transports/` (inbound, a
  `ChannelTransportProvider` ABC with `start_inbound(services)`) and
  `channel_delivery.py` (outbound, the `ChannelDelivery` protocol with
  `deliver_text`, `deliver_rich`, `upload_attachment`, streaming primitives,
  `resolve_user_name`, `build_thread_link`, …). Core never constructs a vendor
  URL: even the "open this thread" deep link is produced by the app behind
  `build_thread_link`.
- **The app got the vendor logic**: `apps/slack-channel/slack_runtime/`, holding
  the transport, runtime facade, delivery, events, interactions, blocks, files,
  and settings with a loud one-time `migrate_from_core()`.
- **Generic residue was extracted, not deleted**: LLM text utilities misfiled in
  the Slack module became core `textfmt.py`, and the gateway orchestrator, which
  was about 95% core boot logic living in `slack/gateway.py`, became core
  `gateway.py`.
- **Naming followed the seam**: routes are `/api/channels/reply-targets` and
  `/api/channel/profile`; the delivery grammar is `deliver="channel[:...]"`;
  session-origin labels are `origin="channel"`. Old Slack-named routes 404, a
  clean break with no aliases.

The same pattern applied to the Ollama client (`llm/ollama.py`, 1002 LOC, now
`apps/ollama-models/provider.py`) and to the vendor-specific inbox source, which
was deleted outright: channels are channel providers, not inbox sources.

## Rules of thumb for contributors

- Adding a provider? Start an app bundle. If core needs an edit, you are probably
  missing a seam, so propose the seam rather than the vendor patch.
- A vendor name in core is acceptable only as (a) a wire-protocol implementation
  many vendors share, (b) fallback-only reference data that declared capabilities
  override, or (c) secret-detection material. Document the judgment in-module.
- Apps import core only via `gideon.sdk.*`. The boundary test will fail your PR
  otherwise.
- Registration belongs to the app (`register_type`, transport registration,
  catalog contribution), never to module-level side effects in core.
