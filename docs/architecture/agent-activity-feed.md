# AgentActivityFeed: the agent-worlds read contract

An **agent world** is an ambient scene of what your agents are doing right now — a
thing you glance at, not a list you read. Gideon ships one first-party world
("Orbit", on the dashboard) and intends for apps to contribute others.

The platform's contribution is **this contract, not the scene**. A world is handed one
typed value and renders it. It opens no socket, calls no endpoint, and knows nothing
about loops, sessions or subagents beyond what is written here.

- Contract + hook: `web/src/lib/useAgentActivity.ts`
- First-party world: `web/src/pages/dashboard/world/` (`AgentWorld.tsx` paints,
  `worldScene.ts` is the pure scene model)
- Plan: the AMBIENT-SURFACES plan (internal) §"Amendment (2026-07-26)" (b), task `A2-3`

## The shape

```ts
useAgentActivity(): {
  entities: AgentActivityEntity[]
  truncated: number      // how many the fold dropped to stay under MAX_ENTITIES (64)
  error: unknown         // the FOLD's own failure — never render this as silence
  loading: boolean       // true until the first fold settles
  refresh: () => void
}

AgentActivityEntity = {
  id: string             // kind-prefixed: 'loop:x' | 'session:x' | 'subagent:x'
  kind: 'session' | 'loop' | 'subagent'
  state: 'working' | 'needs_input' | 'waiting_approval' | 'idle' | 'error'
  title: string          // never empty — falls back to the kind's noun
  progress?: number      // 0..1, ABSENT when unknown (see below)
  refs: { link: string; session?: string; parent?: string }
}
```

Three rules a world must honour:

1. **`progress` absent means UNKNOWN, not zero.** Draw no arc rather than an empty
   one. An empty ring reads as "0% done", which is a claim about a run nobody measured.
2. **`error` is not `entities: []`.** An empty scene means "nothing is running"; a
   failed read means "we could not look". Rendering a calm empty world while every
   fetch is 502ing is the worst thing this surface can do. Say *unknown*.
3. **`truncated > 0` must be stated.** Silently painting 64 of 300 misstates the scale
   of what is running.

## Where the data comes from — four public sources, not three

The fold reads only endpoints the dashboard already reads:

| Source | Contributes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/loops` | every loop | the kind-aware uLoops surface |
| `GET /api/chat/sessions` | live + recently-active chats | archived sessions are excluded; quiet ones are capped |
| `GET /api/spawn` | background subagents | the monitor's own bounded list |
| `GET /api/approvals` | **the `waiting_approval` state** | join key is `PendingApproval.session` |

> The plan's contract text names **three** sources. The fourth is deliberate and was
> added while implementing `A2-3`: `waiting_approval` is in the declared state
> vocabulary and is **not reachable** from the other three. A loop parked on a tool
> approval still reports `status: 'running'`, and the session LIST endpoint
> (`ChatSessionSummary`) carries no `pending_approval` field — only the per-session
> detail shape does. Without `/api/approvals` the state would have shipped as an enum
> member nothing ever writes. `/api/approvals` is public, already polled by
> `DashboardLive`, and joins cleanly on `session` ↔ `Loop.session_key` / session `key`.

An attributed approval **outranks** the entity's own status, for the same reason:
"busy" painted over "one click away from continuing" is the failure the surface exists
to prevent.

### Loop status → world state

The 12-member `UnifiedLoopStatus` collapses to five states **here and nowhere else**,
so every world agrees on what "stuck" looks like.

| loop status | world state |
| --- | --- |
| `intake` `planning` `review` `running` | `working` |
| `needs_input` `blocked` `stagnant` | `needs_input` |
| `failed`, or `complete` with an `error_message` | `error` |
| `ready` `paused` `stopped` `complete` | `idle` |

`blocked` and `stagnant` land on `needs_input` on purpose — the dashboard's ActiveWork
widget already treats both as "in flight or awaiting them", and a stalled run painted
as calm `working` is precisely the lie an ambient surface must not tell.

## WS envelopes are SIGNALS, NEVER PAYLOADS

This is the load-bearing invariant, inherited verbatim from the DashboardLive contract
(`web/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardLive.tsx`).

`chat_status`, `sessions`, `subagent*`, `update_progress`, `approval` and
`approval_resolved` each **nudge a debounced refetch** (600 ms, so a streaming turn's
envelope storm collapses into one request). Not one field is ever read off an envelope.
A socket reopening after a drop forces a full catch-up refetch; a visibility-gated
10 s poll covers the rest.

Why it matters: envelope shapes drift per producer, several producers emit the same
type with different fields, and a stale process can emit a contradicting one. A surface
that renders envelope payloads renders whichever producer spoke last.

The rail is `web/src/lib/agentActivitySignals.test.tsx`. It delivers a `chat_status`
carrying deliberately **misleading** `status`, `title`, `running`, `progress` and
`entities` fields and asserts the rendered scene came from the refetch — paired with a
positive control that the refetch demonstrably happened, because "no bad field
appeared" is vacuously true for a hook that did nothing at all.

## What a world may and may not do

A world **receives** `AgentActivityFeed` and renders it. It must not:

- call an endpoint, open a socket, or import `lib/api`;
- consume any other data hook (`useDashboardLive`, `useCachedData`, …);
- take host-specific props — a world is handed a contract, not wired to a page.

`web/src/pages/dashboard/world/agentWorldRender.test.ts*` enforces all of this
structurally against the first-party world's source, because a behavioural test cannot
see a fetch in a branch it did not reach.

### Motion

- **Smooth state interpolation.** An entity whose state changes MOVES to its new ring
  and crossfades its tone; it never teleports. The ease is a critically-damped
  approach, so a 144 Hz display and a 30 Hz one settle in the same wall-clock time.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is a STATIC LAYOUT** — not a slower animation.
  Orbit schedules **no animation frame at all** and paints one settled frame with
  `pulse` and `speed` at zero, at the same positions and tones the animated scene rests
  at (reduced motion must not cost information). Audited with a positive control that
  the animated path *does* schedule frames.
- **Rendering tier.** Orbit is a high-craft **canvas 2D** scene (layered additive glow,
  per-node tone crossfade, eased orbits) — the "high-craft canvas" half of the plan's
  "WebGL/shader-grade OR high-craft canvas" disjunction. A `webgl` tier was drafted and
  removed rather than shipped untested: a shader pipeline cannot be exercised in jsdom,
  so it would have been a declared tier with an unverified runtime — a black rectangle
  for anyone whose shader compile failed. With no drawing context at all (headless, or
  canvas blocked by an extension) the world degrades to a DOM list of the same scene,
  never a blank box.

### Accessibility

A moving dot field is invisible to assistive tech. The canvas is `role="img"` named by
`sceneSummary()`, and the same sentence is rendered **visibly** beneath it, so nobody
depends on seeing the animation to know what is running.

## Coordination note — app-contributed worlds (APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION)

**This is a doc note, not code.** Nothing in this repository loads a third-party world
today, and this section is the forward hook `A2-3` owes
APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION.

When app-contributed worlds land there, the contract above is the seam and needs no
change. What that plan has to add:

1. **A `world` UI-module kind** in the manifest's existing UI seam. A world is a
   render-only module: it declares no `permissions.api` and no `permissions.events`,
   because it makes no request and subscribes to nothing. That is the whole point of
   folding the data here — a world is the *cheapest possible* app contribution to
   consent to.
2. **`AgentActivityFeed` passed IN, not fetched.** The host owns the single
   `useAgentActivity()` instance and hands the value to the module. Two worlds mounted
   at once must not become two sockets and eight polls.
3. **A picker, and the same host chrome.** Which world renders is a user choice; the
   host keeps the `role="img"` name, the visible summary sentence, the empty/unknown
   states and the reduced-motion decision, so a third-party world cannot opt out of the
   accessibility or motion contract by omission. Pass `reducedMotion` in as a flag
   rather than letting each module ask the media query — an app that forgets to ask
   would animate for a user who asked it not to.
4. **No new provider type is needed for the read path.** An entity *provider* — an app
   contributing its own entities INTO the feed — is a separate, larger question: it
   widens `AgentActivityKind`, which every existing world switches on. Take it as its
   own atom, after the render-only kind ships.

## Adding a field

Add it to `AgentActivityEntity`, populate it in the relevant `fold*` function, and give
it a row in the fold's test. **Never add a fetch to a world instead** — a field on the
contract is available to every world at once, including app-contributed ones; a fetch
in one world is available to nobody and breaks the seam.
