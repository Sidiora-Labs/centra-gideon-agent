# Chat & Sessions

How a message becomes a turn: the session model, the dashboard chat pipeline,
persistence, and the memory-privacy modes. Paths are relative to
`Gideon/src/gideon/`.

## Session model

A session is one conversation thread, whatever surface it lives on (dashboard
chat, channel thread, loop worker, webhook, subagent).

- **`session.py` — `ConversationDirectory`.** Owns live session state. Each session
  has a FIFO message queue (`deque` of pending messages) guarded by a
  semaphore, so messages arriving on the same channel thread are serialized —
  a turn finishes before the next queued message starts.
- **`session_map.py` — the persistent session↔thread map.** Stored at
  `~/.gideon/session_map.json` (atomic tmp+rename writes). Each entry
  carries `sid`, `thread_ts`, `channel_id` — generic keys, no channel-vendor
  shape assumed. `set_channel_link` / `get_channel_link` are the one API for
  linking a dashboard session to a channel thread; a reverse index maps
  `thread_ts` → session key.
- **`session_restrictions.py` — memory modes.** Two restriction registries,
  kept in core because any surface can request them:
  - **temporary** — blank-slate thread: memory READS suppressed
    (`blocks_reads`) *and* writes suppressed.
  - **incognito** — ephemeral: memory WRITES suppressed, reads allowed.

  `is_restricted()` (either mode) gates the after-turn learning path, session
  listing/search, and memory recall (see
  [knowledge-memory.md](knowledge-memory.md)). Restricted sessions never write
  lessons (`after_turn_review.py` checks `session.is_restricted`).
- **`session_workspace.py` / `session_pid.py`** — per-session working
  directory resolution and process-id tracking.

## History & persistence

- **`history.py`** — one JSONL file per session at
  `~/.gideon/sessions/{safe_key}.jsonl`. Files rotate at 2 MB
  (`_SESSION_MAX_BYTES`); dropped lines are archived to `sessions/archive/`
  with a 7-day retention sweep (`ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS`, rate-limited to once
  per hour). Archive *reads* are redacted through `redact_credentials` /
  `redact_exfiltration_urls` before anything leaves the store.
- **`resolve_history_key()`** resolves whether a bare key is a channel-thread
  key or lives in the `dashboard:` namespace *by asking the store* — core
  assumes no key shape and names no provider.
- **`dashboard/chat_persistence.py`** — the dashboard-side persistence
  contract over the JSONL store (message append, metadata, variants).
  Model-to-provider matching is data-driven via
  `catalog.model_family_provider_types(model)` — no vendor names at the call
  site, and unknown model families are never restricted.

## The dashboard chat pipeline

`dashboard/chat_runner.py` is the turn engine. A turn flows:

1. **Prompt-mention expansion** — a leading `@name key=value` expands a saved
   prompt via `_expand_prompt_mention` (user prompts live at
   `~/.gideon/prompts/`, snippets at `prompt_snippets/`; the composer's
   @-menu suggests prompts only at message start).
2. **Context assembly** — `context.py` (`PromptAssembler`) builds the system
   context: the `{{bot_name}}` variable (live-resolved from `agent.bot_name`),
   memory context, and — for channel-linked sessions — the
   `channel-thread-context` snippet. `context_engine.py` and
   `context_compaction.py` manage sizing and compaction.
3. **Agent resolution** — the selected agent's prompt governs. Task-mode
   posture is layered as a `system_prompt_suffix` ON TOP of the resolved agent
   prompt — never a replacement (see `chat_runner.py` around the
   `system_prompt_suffix` call site).
4. **Model resolution** — the `chat` use-case binding from
   `active_models.json`, unless the agent pins a model or the composer
   overrides per-session (the `model` kwarg threads through
   `llm/registry.py` `registry.build`; every factory honors it).
5. **Streaming + persistence** — chunks stream over the dashboard WebSocket;
   the finished turn appends to the session JSONL.

Around the engine:

- **`dashboard/chat_handlers.py`** — session listing/history. Channel-linked
  rows carry `origin="channel"` (computed at list-time from the session map,
  never persisted); the frontend `ChatPage.tsx` switches tabs on that literal.
- **`dashboard/chat_title.py`** — auto-title plus optional auto-tagging in ONE
  background LLM call (config `dashboard.auto_tag_sessions`);
  `chat_retag.py` is the batch re-tag job (cancellable, board-triggered).
- **`dashboard/chat_folders.py` / `chat_tags.py`** — organization; persisted
  in `folders.json` / `tags.json`.
- **`dashboard/chat_channel.py`** — channel link/handoff routes
  (`POST /api/chat/sessions/{session}/channel-link`,
  `GET /api/channels/reply-targets`) — provider-blind, built on
  `ChannelDelivery` only (see [inbox-channels.md](inbox-channels.md)).
- **`dashboard/chat_voice.py`** — `POST /api/voice/synthesize`, sentence-
  chunked TTS through `tts.registry.active_voice_params` (whatever TTS
  provider is bound).

## Variant branching (regenerate)

`dashboard/chat_regenerate.py`: regenerating an assistant message preserves
the prior answer as a **variant**. The message's `variants[]` list (capped at
`_MAX_VARIANTS`) plus `variant_idx` are persisted in the session JSONL, so the
user can flip between alternative answers and the choice survives reload. The
backend broadcasts variant switches; the frontend renders prev/next navigation
on the message.

## Forking

`dashboard/chat_fork.py` — `POST /api/chat/sessions/{session}/fork` copies a
session into a new tab. App-scoped callers may only fork sessions they own
(the `app` claim is checked; unscoped sessions are denied to apps).

## Channel-linked sessions

A dashboard session can be linked to a channel thread (and vice versa):

- Linking goes through core `session_map.set_channel_link` — the channel app
  never touches the map file directly.
- `sync_bridge.py` implements the dashboard↔channel handoff
  (`handoff_to_channel` over `ChannelDelivery`): the conversation continues in
  the channel with context intact.
- `voice_reply.py` uploads TTS voice replies to the channel
  (`upload_voice_to_channel`); markdown deep links are stripped generically
  before synthesis.

## Prompt entities

`prompt_providers/` is the prompt-catalog subsystem (bundled use-case prompts
plus user prompts). Use-case prompts include e.g. `task-channel-title`
(use case `channel_title`) for naming channel-originated tasks. All bundled
prompts are provider-blind.
