# Security Model

Defense in depth for a system that runs an autonomous agent on your machine:
authentication modes, command screening, an OS sandbox, one egress chokepoint,
scoped tokens, supply-chain gates, untrusted-content fencing, and a
tamper-evident audit log. Paths are relative to
`Gideon/src/gideon/`.

## Auth modes

`auth/modes.py` defines four modes, but **only two are selectable today**.
`AuthConfig.from_env()` recognises `GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none` and otherwise
returns the `local_token` default — so `api_key` and `oauth2` cannot be reached
from configuration even though their request-side halves are built.

| Mode | Selectable | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | ✅ | No token auth — **bind is forced to loopback** by `effective_bind` (an unauthenticated gateway must never leave the host). Dev convenience. |
| `local_token` | ✅ | The default: token auth with a login page; static assets bypass the check (the real asset surface only — `dashboard/token_auth.py`). An opt-in, IP-gated local-network bypass exists. |
| `api_key` | ❌ **not selectable** | Header key auth. Validation is implemented (`dashboard/token_auth.py` checks `Authorization: Bearer` against the configured key) but no env value reaches it. |
| `oauth2` | ❌ **not selectable** | OIDC JWT verification is implemented (`auth/oidc.py`, imported lazily only in this mode) but no env value reaches it. |

**What that means in practice.** Setting `GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=api_key` leaves
the gateway on `local_token` and silently ignores `GIDEON_API_KEY`. It fails
**closed** — a client presenting `Authorization: Bearer <that key>` is refused, not
admitted — so the cost is lost access, not weakened auth. But it is a configuration
that reads as working and is not, which is why it is stated here rather than left to
be discovered.

Wiring the selector is tracked as roadmap scope, and it carries one design question
worth settling deliberately rather than in passing: whether an unhonourable mode
should **refuse at startup** or fall back. Refusing is the honest posture for a
security control, but `from_env()` is also called as a fallback inside a request path
(`dashboard/origin.py`), so a naive raise would turn a misconfiguration into a 500
rather than a clean boot failure. The fix belongs with that atom, not in a doc change.

### The `AUTH_MODE=none` sandbox fix

Skipping the token-auth middleware in none-mode used to silently disable the
**entire app permission sandbox**: the middleware is what adopts the `app`
claim from an app-scoped token, and without it an app-scoped request could
reach ANY `/api` path. The fix (`dashboard/server.py`, the
`_dev_user_middleware`) re-implements claim adoption in none-mode: it extracts
the Bearer/`?app_token=` token, validates it (`validate_token_with_app`), and
sets `request["app"]` so `app_permission_middleware` and the WS event filter
scope the request. The app token only *narrows* the dev owner's reach — the
permission model holds in every auth mode.

## Token scoping

`dashboard/token_auth.py`:

- `generate_token(user_id, ttl_seconds, app=...)` mints tokens with an
  optional **`app` claim**; app-scoped tokens bound a request to that app's
  declared permissions.
- App backends never see the owner's credential: the reverse proxy strips
  cookie + Authorization and injects a fresh 1-hour app-scoped token
  (see [app-platform.md](app-platform.md#the-reverse-proxy--token-model)).
- Session TTLs are capped (`MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS`); nonces are registered and
  evicted.

### Webhook auth

`POST /api/hooks/agent` (`dashboard/handlers/hooks.py`) is
middleware-exempt; its **only** gate is `_verify_hook_token` — a
constant-time (`hmac.compare_digest`) check of the Bearer or
`x-gideon-token` header against `hooks.webhook_token` in config. No
configured token means every request is refused. Denials are logged to the
Security Event Log.

## Command screening (`security.py`)

- **Deny list** — `BUILTIN_DENIED_COMMAND_PATTERNS` (112 shell patterns) is
  merged with user-configured `security.denied_commands` **at read time**
  (`denied_command_patterns()`), so config edits apply immediately. This one
  source feeds both the native bash tool and the Security panel.
- **Suspicious-pattern watchers** — `SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS` (52 patterns)
  flag rather than block.
- **Tool-name denies** — `BUILTIN_DENY_PATTERNS` (fnmatch over tool names)
  with a documented `_DENY_EXCEPTIONS` escape hatch.
- **Redaction** — sensitive-path and credential redaction, including
  vendor-token detection patterns (e.g. `xox[bpas]-`). These vendor-shaped
  patterns are deliberate keeps: they are secret-*detection* data; renaming
  them would break the control (see
  [provider-boundary.md](provider-boundary.md)).

## Sandbox (`sandbox.py`)

Credential-hiding child-process isolation for tool execution, including an
environment-variable denylist (credential env vars like `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
never reach a sandboxed child).

Child **environments** are built by allowlist, not inherited: `build_child_env`
gives a hook, cron-script or bash-action child a minimal base
(`PATH`, locale, home-equivalents, proxy/CA settings, and the three
`GIDEON_*` vars) plus whatever names the operator declared in
`sandbox.env_passthrough`. Nothing else from the gateway environment reaches
them, so a credential the gateway holds is not readable by `printenv`. The
sensitive-prefix list above is the floor: a declaration cannot pass
`AWS_SECRET*`, `AWS_SESSION*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `GNUPGHOME` or `GIT_ASKPASS`.
Withheld names are listed in the debug log at each spawn, so a script that
needs one more variable is diagnosable rather than mysteriously broken.

### What the sandbox does and does not do

This is a **credential-hiding sandbox, not a confinement sandbox** — a precise distinction
that the rest of this section, and any public claim, must respect. The macOS Seatbelt profile
is allow-by-default (`(version 1)\n(allow default)`) with targeted `deny file-read*` rules over
credential paths (`~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.azure`, `~/.docker`, `~/.kube`,
`.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.gideon/.env`, plus `~/.ssh` in
`strict`); the Linux path is equivalent (bind-mount empty dirs over those paths). It raises the
cost of credential theft; it does not stop an agent from doing anything else.

| It **does** | It does **not** |
|---|---|
| Hide credential dirs/files from the agent child (macOS Seatbelt deny-reads; Linux bind-mounts) | Confine filesystem **writes** (except `~/.ssh` on macOS `strict`) |
| Scrub credential env vars from the child, every mode | Restrict **network / egress** from the child |
| Deny `~/.ssh` writes (macOS `strict` only) | Limit processes, CPU, or memory (no rlimits) |
| Path-allowlist a subagent's cwd (advisory — the prompt tells the agent its scope) | Provide a filesystem **jail** or a real execution boundary |
| Enforce app `api`/`storage`/`memory`/`cron` permissions server-side | Enforce the app `network` permission (declaration-only — see `docs/security/limitations.md`) |

The honest, complete statement of limitations lives in
[`../security/threat-model.md`](../security/threat-model.md) and
[`../security/limitations.md`](../security/limitations.md); this section is the architectural
summary, not a substitute for them.

## Governance ceiling (`guardrails/ceiling.py`)

Two levels, one rule — **tightest wins**. Level 1 is the operator's `Ceiling`,
read ONCE at boot; level 2 is the run's `SafetyProfile`
(`guardrails/policy.py`), which may only **narrow**. Effective posture =
`resolve(ceiling, profile)`, composed inside `profile_for_session` — the single
object every dispatch seam already consults (rung routing, the action denylist,
the tool-approval pick, spawn, egress), so there is no seam that reads a profile
the ceiling did not bound.

- **Where it lives.** `$GIDEON_HOME/governance/ceiling.json`, or an
  absolute path in `GIDEON_CEILING_FILE`. Schema:
  `{"version": 1, "scopes": {...}}` over six governed scopes — `approval`,
  `scan`, `egress` (ordinal), `paths` (ruleset), `tools` (capability gate),
  `budget` (scoped map).
- **Four archetypes, one compose function each** (`compose_ordinal`,
  `compose_ruleset`, `compose_gate`, `compose_map`). The evaluator dispatches on
  **archetype, never on scope name**, so adding a governed scope is one
  `ScopeSpec` row of data.
- **Enforcer-owned registries** (`guardrails/registries.py`): matchers and
  ordinal scales live in code and are never sourced from the governed file — a
  rule that could name its own matcher or reorder a scale could widen itself
  while reading as narrower. An unknown matcher/scale/scope/value, a corrupt or
  unreadable file, or a scope naming an unknown archetype **aborts governance
  boot** with WHAT/WHY/FIX. Fail-closed: "governance could not be established"
  is a stop, not a degraded mode.
- **Path matching** normalizes only the queried item (`~`/`$VAR`, then
  `abspath`) and **never** runs a pattern through `normpath`, which would
  collapse `/a/**/../b` to `/a/b` and silently drop the `**`
  (`checks/runtime/test_guardrails_path_matcher.py` is the table).
- **What the layer buys**: no HTTP write surface (absent from the
  `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist, no PUT of its own); agent write paths
  refuse it (`governance/` is in the built-in sensitive-path denylist); no
  mid-run widening (read once and cached, so a tamper needs a restart an
  operator can see); tamper evidence (boot SEL-audits source + digest). Every
  clamp is logged and SEL-audited (`guardrails.ceiling_clamp`).
- **What it does NOT buy**: OS-level immutability against a process running as
  the operator. On a single-user machine that requires the file to live outside
  `$HOME`, owned by another uid and mode `0444` — which is what
  `GIDEON_CEILING_FILE` is for.

## Egress chokepoint (`net/`)

`net/client.py` + `net/guard.py` + `net/policy.py` form the ONE outbound-HTTP
chokepoint:

- Named policies: `STRICT`, `CONNECTOR` (knowledge scraping), `WEBHOOK`
  (user-configured POSTs), `LOOPBACK_INTERNAL` (loopback only — **never
  widened** by config), `REGISTRY`/`LISTED` (exclusive allow-lists),
  `FETCH_ACTION` (the `net-fetch` action provider — exclusive over an EMPTY
  base list, so an unconfigured instance reaches nowhere).
- The **exclusive** profiles — `LISTED`, `SYNC`, `FETCH_ACTION`, and the derived
  `capture`/`a2a-outbound` — are the ones where a caller, not a person, picks the
  URL. Each is `allow_only=True` over an empty base, so "nothing named yet" means
  "nowhere to go". `METADATA_SERVICE_HOSTS` is denied on the two that can be
  pointed at an operator-named host (`SYNC`, `FETCH_ACTION`): a deny is evaluated
  before the allow-list AND before DNS, so it survives an operator who lists the
  cloud metadata service by hand.
- `egress_policy_for(base)` is the single config-layering seam: the Security
  panel's allow/deny hosts and `allow_private` are layered onto a base policy
  at the `web_fetch`/`web_extract`/render entry (`apps/console/fetch.py`) and at
  webhook/knowledge-connector call sites (`knowledge/connectors/web_url.py`).
  Raw `net.fetch` stays config-free for fixed-posture internal callers.
- `allow_only` inverts `allow_hosts` from ADDITIVE (waive the private-range
  block) to EXCLUSIVE (only a listed host is reachable), checked before DNS
  resolution. It is what makes an egress TIER able to narrow anything.
- `egress_policy_for_profile(base, tier)` narrows a surface policy by the RUN's
  `SafetyProfile.egress_tier` — tightest wins, and caps only tighten. `off`
  returns `None` and the caller refuses. Live at `apps/console/fetch.py::web_fetch` (the
  agent's primary fetch surface) and `triggers/web_poll.py` (watched-source
  polls, plain + headless tier).

## Browsing on the user's behalf (`browse/`)

The `browse` action provider has two execution targets. `gateway` drives the gateway's own
Chrome profile under the egress chokepoint above. `user_browser` drives the operator's OWN,
already-logged-in browser through a paired loopback extension (`browse/target.py`,
`dashboard/handlers/browse_connector.py`). Because that target acts as the fully-authenticated
user, its authorization is not the earned-autonomy ladder but a **per-task grant**, and these
rules are load-bearing controls, not UX:

- **Per-task grant, fail-closed.** Every `user_browser` task requires a fresh, explicit human
  grant naming the site scope it will touch, routed through the shipped `ApprovalGate`
  (`agents/native/approval.py`) before the browser is touched. No answer within 300s, no approval
  channel, or any gate error is a **REJECT** — the run never starts, never falls open, and never
  silently retargets the gateway profile (`browse/grant.py`).
- **No-credential-access invariant.** The agent drives an already-authenticated browser; it never
  reads, stores, or transmits a password field's value, a 2FA code, or a cookie jar. The grant and
  revoke audit rows (`browser_grant`, `browser_revoked` in the SEL) carry only the task label, the
  host scope, and a reason — never a credential, cookie, or token.
- **Close-to-kill.** The task runs in a tab group named after the task; the user closing it is a
  hard stop the run observes within one step. This is distinct from the browse kill switch
  (`browse/killswitch.py`), which stops *all* unattended browse via a flag.
- **Honest limit — no IP pinning on a real browser.** A real browser does its own DNS and opens
  its own sockets, so `net.fetch`'s resolved-IP pinning does **not** apply to `user_browser`: every
  navigation is still pre-flighted through the egress guard, but that is validation only and stays
  rebind-vulnerable. This is inherent to driving any real browser and is stated here rather than
  implied away.
- **Not an anti-bot surface.** This target exists to let the agent act in the user's browser under
  explicit per-task permission. Gideon does **not** describe, design, or expose anti-bot or
  CAPTCHA avoidance as a capability; any such effect is an incidental consequence of legitimate
  traffic from the user's own machine, never a feature.

## Untrusted-content fencing

`security.py::fence_untrusted` wraps third-party text in
`<untrusted_content>` markers (escaping any embedded marker so content can't
break out), paired with a system-prompt note that fenced spans are data, not
instructions. Applied to web-search results, inbox content, and third-party
payloads; memory recall applies the same data-not-instructions framing to
recalled episodes (`dashboard/handlers/memory.py`; see
[knowledge-memory.md](knowledge-memory.md#recall--the-privacy-guard)).

## Supply chain (`supply_chain.py`)

`SkillScanner` gates both app installs and skill installs through
`install_guarded`:

- verdicts: clean / warning (consent required — 409) / **dangerous (terminal
  refusal, non-overridable)**;
- the integrity invariant: **scanned bytes == installed bytes** (no
  time-of-check/time-of-use window between scan and install);
- source trust tiers modulate strictness (a bundled skill's `curl` is not the
  same risk as a random repository's).

## Trust / YOLO state (`trust_mode.py`)

ONE process-global YOLO (auto-approve) state: config-permanent vs TTL'd
surface activation (`YOLO_CHANNEL_TTL_SECS`), with `on_disable` callbacks.
Dashboard and channel apps delegate to it — there is deliberately no second
implementation. Task-mode tool-gating postures are hard-enforced at the
permission prompt for the native runtime; ACP agents under YOLO rely on
system-prompt framing (a documented tradeoff — `task_modes.py`).

## Audit — the Security Event Log (`sel.py`)

`SecurityEventLog` writes HMAC-chained events (key file `sel_hmac.key`) —
tamper-evident, append-only. Events carry caller, operation, outcome, and
`downstream_service` labels (the generic value is `"channel"`; no vendor
names). API denials, webhook auth failures, and app lifecycle events all log
here. The dashboard Security panel reads it.

## Data-leaving-the-system rules

- Session-archive reads are redacted (`history.py` via
  `redact_credentials` / `redact_exfiltration_urls`).
- Portability export (`portability.py`) always excludes credentials: `.env`,
  `sel_hmac.key`, `session_map.json` are on the exclusion list.

## Memory privacy

Restricted sessions (temporary/incognito) gate memory reads/writes and lesson
capture — enforced in the after-turn path, session listing/search, and the
recall API. Details in
[chat-sessions.md](chat-sessions.md#session-model) and
[knowledge-memory.md](knowledge-memory.md#recall--the-privacy-guard).
