// Gideon launch-demo capture — plays the scripted click-path in CLICKPATH.md
// against a gateway seeded with the `demo-home` fixture AND a bound local model, and
// records it silently.
//
// The click-path doc is the contract; this file is its executable half. Every beat
// below carries the same id as the beat in CLICKPATH.md, and the per-beat `seconds`
// here are the timings that doc publishes. Change one, change both.
//
// WHY a script and not a hand-driven screen recording: the UI moves. A hand-driven
// capture is unreproducible the moment a nav label or a route changes, so the
// recording rots and nobody can re-make it. This script fails loudly on a missing
// target instead, which is the signal to update the path.
//
// TWO PHASES. The recorded take is the second one. The first — `preroll()` — sends a
// real prompt in a NON-recording context and waits for the turn to park on the
// tool-permission gate, because a local 12B model needs 1.5-4 minutes on a shared
// machine to get there and a 60-90s asset cannot contain that dead time. Nothing is
// staged by this: the prompt, the model's output, the gate, the human decision and the
// artifact are all real, and the recorded take is where the gate is read and approved.
// See CLICKPATH.md § "Why the turn is started before the recording".
//
// Prereqs:
//   1. `npm ci && npm run build --workspace web` (the gateway serves the built SPA;
//      see `make web-build`, which also links src/gideon/static/dist).
//   2. A local Ollama with a chat model pulled (nothing else is bindable without a
//      credential, which is why it is the provider a committed path can use).
//   3. A gateway on an ISOLATED home seeded from the demo fixture WITH that model
//      bound — never your real ~/.gideon, and never a port another process owns.
//      Use GIDEON_PORT, not `--port`: `--port` moves the gateway but not its MCP
//      tool subprocesses, which resolve from `cfg.dashboard.url` and default to
//      127.0.0.1:10000 (issue #2539), so a tool call would hang on someone else's
//      gateway.
//

//   DEMO_SESSION=<chat-key>  skip the pre-roll and re-record against a session that is
//                            ALREADY parked on an artifact_save gate (a re-record after
//                            a broken target costs 4 minutes of model time otherwise).
//   DEMO_ARTIFACT=<slug>     the artifact the recorded approval produces, when the model
//                            did not take the name the prompt asked for.
//
// Output: <OUT_DIR>/gideon-tour.webm, plus gideon-tour.mp4 when ffmpeg
// is on PATH. Silent by construction — Playwright's screencast records no audio.
// OUT_DIR defaults to /tmp/gideon-demo-media because the capture is far too large to
// commit to this repo; see CLICKPATH.md § "Where the file lives".
