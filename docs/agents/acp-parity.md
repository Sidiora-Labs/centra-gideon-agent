# ACP Agent Parity — Per-Provider Capability Statement

Gideon can run a turn on an external coding CLI over the Agent Client Protocol (ACP)
instead of on its own native runtime. This document states, per provider, what that costs.

## How to read this

**ACP providers are not at native parity, and this document exists because the gap is
documented rather than hidden.** The native runtime holds the tool registry, the
pre-execution gate, the failure breaker and the learning drain *inside* its own loop. An ACP
provider is a separate process speaking a protocol, so anything the host cannot see or cannot
reach across that protocol is either supplied by the host from outside, or simply not there.

Every capability below is in exactly one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **At parity** | Works on this provider the way it works on the native runtime. |
| **Host-compensated** | The CLI does not provide it; Gideon supplies it from the host side, sometimes with a boundary the host cannot cross. That boundary is stated on the row. |
| **Protocol or CLI constraint** | Cannot work today. Each row carries its reason, the watch item (what would have to change, and where), and the version it was measured against. |

A fourth list per provider — **not yet measured** — is not a bucket. It exists so a reader can
tell *measured absent* from *never driven*. A cell in that list is neither working nor broken
as far as this document is concerned; it has no runtime observation behind it, and no claim
here rests on it.

**Versions are stated because a CLI can change any week.** Every constraint row names the
build it was measured against. Two of the three columns were measured against *older* builds
than the ones installed today, and one column was measured against the same build and then
failed to reproduce — see "Coverage" below before treating any row as current fact.

**Evidence ids** (`O4`, `C12`, `K30`, `G27`) refer to the observation ledgers and gap
inventory in [`../roadmap/plans/ACP-AGENT-PARITY.md`](../roadmap/plans/ACP-AGENT-PARITY.md).
Every claim in this document traces to a ledger row, a `G`-entry, or a measured version below.
Nothing here was derived by reading code alone.

## Verified versions

Measured on the development host on 2026-08-19:

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` (Claude Code CLI) | `2.1.234.669` | ASBX build, channel `stable` |
| `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` | `0.62.0` | adapter; claude-code speaks ACP through it |
| `codex` | `0.146.1.360` | channel `stable` |
| `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` | `1.1.7` | adapter |
| `kiro-cli` | `2.18.1` | native ACP — no adapter in the path |
| `gemini` | **not installed** | catalog row and bundle exist; provider unverified |

**The adapters are installed per-home, not globally.** They live at
`<GIDEON_HOME>/acp-adapters/node_modules/.bin/` — a reader who checks `PATH` for
`claude-agent-acp` or `codex-acp` finds nothing and will wrongly conclude the adapters are
missing. `kiro-cli` is the exception: it speaks ACP natively, so there is no adapter and no
adapter version to pin.

## Coverage — what has actually been measured

The audit that produced these columns defines **63 cells** — one per capability, the same 63
for every provider. Each column was filled by driving the system as a user (dashboard and API,
one isolated home per sweep), never by reading code. Marks: `CONFIRMED` (runtime matched the
audit's prediction), `DIVERGED` (runtime contradicted it), `ENV` (an environment limit, never a
capability verdict), `NOT-EXERCISED` (no runtime observation).

| Provider | CONFIRMED | DIVERGED | ENV | NOT-EXERCISED | Sweep |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude-code | 43 | 7 | 0 | **13** | 2026-08-17 + a residual re-drive 2026-08-19, adapter `0.60.0`, `claude` `2.1.233.669` |
| codex | 33 | 10 | 0 | **20** | 2026-08-17, adapter `1.1.4`, `codex` `0.146.1.359` |
| kiro-cli | 43 | 18 | 1 | **1** | 2026-08-17/18, a follow-up sweep 2026-08-18, plus a residual re-drive 2026-08-19, `kiro-cli` `2.18.1` |
| gemini-cli | — | — | — | 63 | never driven; binary not installed |

Three things a reader must carry into every section below.

**1. kiro's tool axis reproduces, and four of its rows were wrong.** An earlier drive on
2026-08-19 got `NO_TOOLS` from `kiro-cli 2.18.1` and this document briefly published every kiro tool
row as *measured, not reproduced*. A second drive the same day, on a fresh isolated home, settles it:
the CLI enumerated **151 tool names** — its own `shell`/`read`/`write`/`grep`/`glob`, the operator's
twelve MCP servers, **and the whole `gideon-core` surface** — and `pwd` answered the session's
own `workspace_dir` (`K51`). The `NO_TOOLS` answer is best explained as a **gate artifact**: the
turn's first tool call raises an approval card and parks the turn, and the CLI's own wording was
per-turn (*"in this turn"*) (`K52`). What the reproduction then exposed is more serious than the
scare: `K4`'s enumeration had missed the protocol-delivered surface, and **four rows were scored off
it** — the native registry, both skills rows and subagents. All four are corrected below, three of
them by CALLING the tools rather than re-reading a list (`K57`).

**2. claude-code and codex are not complete columns.** 13 and 20 cells respectively have no
runtime observation. Their sections list those cells grouped by why, and the summary tables do
not imply anything about them. claude's residual came down from 22 in a 2026-08-19 re-drive that
reused the recipes kiro's follow-up sweep had already proven; the nine cells it closed are marked
with their own observation ids below.

**3. ONE kiro cell has no runtime observation**, and the reason changed. The skill-ladder review is
not gate-less: its condition is a correction signal **or** four tool calls, both drivable, and driving
it shows the ladder running (and, on a local model with the shipped 60 s HTTP timeout, dying silently
mid-pass). What blocks the cell is that **no surface attributes a model call to its caller**, so a
ladder that declines and a ladder that never ran look identical from outside (`G47`, superseding
`G44`). The other cell once called unreachable — empty-turn auto-retry — was closed by asking the CLI
for zero characters (`K55`); it was never unreachable, just never attempted.

## Constraints that hold on all three providers

These rows were measured on more than one provider. Each provider section below applies this
table in addition to its own rows. "Watch" names what would have to change and where — the
CLI, the adapter, the ACP protocol, or this repo. A host-owned row has no upstream watch item:
it is ours.

| Axis | Capability | Why it does not work | Watch — what must change, where | Measured against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tools | Typed tool-result meta (`content_type`, `raw_ref`, `truncated`, `original_length`, `recovery_hints`) | The protocol's result frames carry none of these fields. The host leaves them empty rather than fabricating values — every ACP `tool_result` reads `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []` (`O6`, `C5`, `K5`) | **ACP protocol** — result metadata would have to exist on the wire. Empty is the honest shape until it does | adapter `0.60.0` / `1.1.4`, `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Tools | Structured tool-input rendering and file-change diff chips | Not a protocol limit — the raw material is already on the wire and the host drops it. claude sends `kind: "read"｜"edit"｜"execute"` plus a `rawInput` JSON (`O6`); codex sends a real `{type: "diff", oldText, newText, path}` object (`C5`, `G22`); kiro sends a unified diff (`K12`). The frontend receives `input: null` and zero diff keys | **Host seam** (`G9`, `G22`; atom `AAP-8`). Nothing upstream | adapter `0.60.0` / `1.1.4`, `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Session mechanics | Slash commands and `/compact` | None of the three implements `_vendor.dev/commands/execute`; all three answered `-32601 "Method not found"` — byte-identical across two adapters and a native CLI (`O23`, `C8`, `K11`), which made it host-side rather than one adapter's gap. **The turn no longer fails** (fixed 2026-08-21): the host sends the request only to an agent that advertised the capability, and otherwise answers the input as an ordinary prompt with an inline notice saying the command was not run natively. What is still absent is the command actually EXECUTING — a `/compact` gets a plain answer, not compaction | **Host half DONE** (`G4`; atom `AAP-9`) — gated + degrades to text. What remains is upstream: an adapter would have to implement `commands/execute`, or advertise the capability, for a command to run | adapter `0.60.0` / `1.1.4`, `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Session mechanics | Context-% accounting | Worse than absent: a `context_usage` frame is emitted on **every** turn with `pct: 0.0`, and the turn line prints `context 0%` — including turns carrying 13–18 KB of injected context (`O7`, `C4`, `K4`). The UI states a number no backend supplied | **Adapters** would have to report token stats; failing that, **host seam** must omit the chip instead of printing zero (`G8`; atom `AAP-8`) | adapter `0.60.0` / `1.1.4`, `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Learning / memory | Procedural-outcome capture (the tool-outcome drain) | Zero rows after multi-tool ACP turns on all three (`O12` — 6 tool calls, nothing; `C14`; `K17` — the only rows came from a **0-tool** correction turn, and the self-model row it wrote asserts `tools: []`). The drain reads an accumulator the native runtime keeps in its own loop; the ACP provider exposes no equivalent | **Host seam** (`G7`; atom `AAP-8`) — accumulate off the neutral tool-call/tool-result stream | adapter `0.60.0` / `1.1.4`, `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Approvals / safety | A CLI-side refusal never reaches the audit trail | When the CLI refuses on its own, no frame reaches the host and no SEL row is written: claude's own deny list refused `git push --dry-run` invisibly (`O21`, `G11`), and codex's `request_user_input` failed CLI-side with `0 tool calls` counted and no row (`C9`, `G25`). The host's audit therefore under-reports what the CLI declined | **Adapters** would have to emit a refusal frame | adapter `0.60.0` / `1.1.4` (not driven on kiro) |
| Prompt-side context | Mid-turn queue-steering | The protocol has no mid-turn injection seam. A message sent during a live ACP turn is queued and runs as its own turn afterwards — `{"queued": true}`, then `queue_pop` (`C10`, `K15`). Queue-then-drain is the documented ACP semantic, not a bug | **ACP protocol** | adapter `1.1.4`, `kiro-cli 2.18.1` (claude's probe missed the window — `O26`, not measured) |
| Prompt-side context | `@prompt` expansion | Provider-independent by construction: expansion is composer-side. A message carrying a literal `@name` reaches the CLI unexpanded and nothing on the ACP path expands it (`K30`, `K31`, and `O34` on claude-code); the render endpoint works when called directly and the composer is its caller | **Not a provider gap** — whatever the composer substitutes is what any provider receives | `kiro-cli 2.18.1`, adapter `0.60.0` (not driven on codex). `O34` is the stronger form: the prompt body was written with `PUT` and proven server-side by `/render` FIRST, so the absent expansion cannot be an empty prompt |

### Host compensation that landed after these sweeps

The six mechanisms below exist in the host today but post-date the matrix columns that
measured their cells. (Six is counted from the rows, not carried in prose.) Where a mechanism has only been driven as-a-user on one provider, that is
said here rather than generalized — a landed mechanism is not a measured one.

| What the host now supplies | Driven as-a-user on | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| The `gideon-core` tool surface (knowledge, tasks, artifacts, workflows, subagents, `notify`) passed in `mcpServers` at `session/new` | **kiro only** (`K32` — the turn's first tool call was `@gideon-core/get_context`, and it raised its own approval card). claude and codex last measured "no `gideon-core` surface at all" (`O4`, `C4`) at their earlier tips and have not been re-driven | A CLI that ignores protocol-passed `mcpServers` needs config seeding instead (below) |
| ~~Config seeding for kiro's agent discovery~~ — **it does not run, and it is not needed** (`K54`, `G46`). The seeding code is real, but its only caller is gated on an `agent_config_dir` argument **no ACP bundle passes**: driven end to end there is no seed log line, no receipt, nothing in `~/.kiro/agents/`, and kiro's discovery returns the same 27 agents as `K2`. Nor is it required — with no `~/.kiro/mcp.json` on the machine and no agent file naming us, a kiro session still enumerated the whole `gideon-core` surface, so kiro honours protocol-passed `mcpServers` | **driven 2026-08-19** (`K54`) | Seeding never edits a user file; a pre-existing path we did not write is refused, not clobbered |
| Permission authority: the host refuses to hand a Zed dialect a self-approving mode (`acceptEdits`/`dontAsk`/`bypassPermissions`) outside an explicit unattended session, and the deny-list is evaluated against the **real command** rather than the truncated permission title | **not re-driven** as a column | Covers only tools the CLI chooses to escalate — see the not-gateable residual below |
| Unattended fail-fast: an approval request arriving on an unattended session is auto-denied with a reason and the turn ends, instead of parking forever waiting for a human | **kiro only** (`K41` — `auto-denied: unattended run, no one to approve`, `[DONE]` in 5.2 s, nothing left pending, the requested file never created). The claude and codex cells were never driven | kiro has no permission-mode axis, so it gets the fail-fast half only — there is no restrictive mode to forward |
| **The permission frame is told what the opening `tool_call` frame declared** — its `kind` and its human title, correlated on `toolCallId`, the only id the two frames share. Adapters split a tool announcement across two frames and each drops a different half: claude-code-acp's permission payload carries a title but no `kind` (`G10`), codex's carries `{toolCallId, kind, status}` and no title (`G18`), so cards read `unknown` and the risk mapping had nothing to read. The frame's own declaration always wins; the correlation only fills an absence, and a card still reads `unknown` when NEITHER frame named the tool — a name is never invented | **not re-driven** as a column — the mechanism is unit-proven off the real two-frame sequence, not from a hand-built cache | Correlation cannot invent what no frame declared, and the CLI-declared `kind` is deliberately kept OUT of the task-mode gate: a CLI calling its own write a "read" must not be able to turn deny-by-default into an allow |
| **Resume across a gateway restart is live on all three** (`session/load`). A restart mid-conversation now sends `session/load` with the stored session id and the agent accepts it, so the conversation continues on the agent's OWN state — proved by recall of a fact that existed only in a pre-restart tool result, which the compressed-history fallback cannot carry (it selects `roles={"user","assistant"}`). Three defects had to go, none of them the one the gap named: `SessionMap.get` gated a stored id on `sessions/<sid>.json` and DELETED the entry when absent (nothing writes that file, and `prune()` carried the same key, so the map was wiped at every start); `AcpClient` gated the request on its own copy of the same missing file; and an `acp:<cli>` binding resolved a **MODEL** rather than the CLI on any path that skipped the connection-pool claim — which is exactly the path a resume takes | **claude-code, codex and kiro-cli** (`O187` / `O188` / `O189`, 2026-08-23 — restart between two turns, nonce recalled on all three) | The `session_files_dir` the gap named is neither necessary nor sufficient: it is an optional `_meta` hint, and the directory is never communicated to the spawned CLI, so no adapter can write into it. `session/load` needs only `sessionId` + `cwd` + `mcpServers`; the AGENT is the authority and its refusal is what triggers the fallback |
| **A provider that cannot resume says so.** Where `loadSession` is absent (or the agent refuses the id), the turn falls back to `session/new` plus the compressed-history bootstrap and the activity line reads **"Session restored from history"**, not "Session resumed" — the two are not equivalent and the sentence must not collapse them. The label is computed from the same predicate the bootstrap consumes, so it cannot claim a restore that did not run | **claude-code, codex and kiro-cli** (`O190`, 2026-08-23 — observed on all three before the routing fix, while they were genuinely running the fallback) | "Restored from history" is a weaker promise on purpose: user/assistant text survives, tool results do not |
| Model spend on an ACP turn is **not metered by the host** | not applicable — structural | An external CLI owns the model call, out of process and on its own vendor account, so there is no host-side inference for `ModelCallGuard` to wrap and no `model_calls.jsonl` row. This is a protocol boundary, not an audit hole: budgets, breakers and the spend meter govern the native axis only. The ACP builder is listed in the chokepoint rail's `ALLOWED_BUILDERS` for this reason |
| The runtime-agnostic failure breaker and structural loop detection, run by the host off the neutral event stream for ACP turns | **not re-driven**: the last as-a-user measurement of these cells (`O24`, `C10`, `K15` — six consecutive failing tool calls, zero warn/block/circuit/steering) predates it and measured them ABSENT | The host observer can abort or steer **between** protocol events; it cannot block the next tool call pre-execution the way the native breaker does |

## claude-code

`claude` `2.1.234.669` through `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` `0.62.0`, Zed dialect
`claude-code`. **The column was measured on adapter `0.60.0` and `claude` `2.1.233.669`, and 22
of its 63 cells were never driven** — read the two tables below as 41 measured cells, not as a
complete statement.

### At parity

| Axis | Capability | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt-side context | Memory recall injection at turn 0 | `O9`, `O15` — the injection fires and the CLI quoted injected memory and history text back verbatim |
| Prompt-side context | Task-mode framing | `O14` — a fresh plan-mode session's context contains `## Task mode: Plan` and "you MUST NOT make any edits" |
| Prompt-side context | Compressed thread-history bootstrap into a new process | `O14`, `O15` — a brand-new session's context replayed prior turns verbatim, including sibling-session history |
| Prompt-side context | Knowledge `@`-mention / picker injection | `O32` — with `meta.knowledge` bound to the turn the CLI quoted the stored item verbatim, marker string included |
| Prompt-side context | Attachment / paste text extraction | `O32` — the CLI quoted the extracted attachment marker verbatim from a `meta.files` path |
| Prompt-side context | Agent-profile system prompt / voice layer | `O32` — a profile with a distinctive `system_prompt` was bound; the CLI quoted the marker AND obeyed its instruction, so the audit's "the CLI's own prompt dominates" worry does not hold |
| Prompt-side context | Persona injection (theme) | `O33` — with `color_theme` set on the turn the CLI quoted the persona instruction verbatim. It also received the profile's `voice` at the same time and reported the clash itself, unprompted: a profile's voice and a theme's persona are two injection sites with no precedence rule (`G45`, host-side and not ACP-specific) |
| Learning / memory | Memory consolidation on session end | `O29` — `last_consolidated` 0 → 6 in the history metadata, plus a `consolidate_…` lock. The semantic/episodic counters stayed at 0, which is correct for six short probe turns |
| Session mechanics | Auto-nudge re-arm | `O28` — `cycle_count` 0 → 1 → 2 of 2, `active` flipping false at the cap, and both `[auto-nudge cycle N]` injections answered by the CLI |
| Approvals / safety | Unattended mode | `O27` — an unattended Code loop bound to this provider reached `running` and the host's fail-fast denied the write instead of parking it. The audit predicted ABSENT; it is present, and it behaves the same way kiro's `K41` did |
| Approvals / safety | Interactive approval cards | `O5` — four cards in one turn, each resolvable through the approve route |
| Approvals / safety | Task mode enforced before approval | `O13` (ask blocks a `Write` and a read-only `ls`), `O19`/`O24` (plan blocks every `Write`), SEL rows carrying `reason: task_mode:ask` / `task_mode:plan` |
| Approvals / safety | SEL audit of every executed tool | `O10` — hash-chained `tool_invocation` rows with `tool_kind` and `metadata.risk`, plus `approved`/`denied`/`rejected` decisions. Across 44 audited ACP tool events no tool executed without reaching the host gate — with the contingency in the constraint table below |
| Approvals / safety | Plan mode reaches the CLI's own plan mode | `O19` — the CLI reports "Claude Code's CLI plan mode" and substitutes "Ready to code?" for the edit. **Only when plan is set before the session's first turn** (`G12`); set mid-conversation it reverts to Agent and the host gate is the only enforcement |
| Learning / memory | Preference-facet capture, correction→lesson review | `O22` — `learned` activity events on the correction turn, with no model provider needed. Extraction quality is poor: the facet learned was the fragment "never more" (`G16`) |
| Session mechanics | Variants / regenerate | `O25` — the regenerated message carries `variants` and `variant_idx` |
| Session mechanics | Edit & resend, fork | `O25` — the fork carries all 24 messages, **but loses the ACP binding** (`acp_provider: ""`, `G13`) |
| Session mechanics | Per-session model override | `O20` — the CLI named the exact pinned model id back |
| Session mechanics | Warm pool / instant start | `O17` — the pool path was exercised; it was cold on this run (`pool_size=0`), so every turn cold-started |
| Session mechanics | Turn telemetry (event and tool counts) | `O7` — `Turn complete: 106 events, 6 tool calls`. The context-% part of the same line is fabricated (shared table) |
| Session mechanics | Reasoning effort — **host side only** | `O2` — the adapter advertises five efforts; `O20` — the host accepted and echoed `low`. The CLI cannot self-report its effort, so whether it *honored* the value was never measured |

### Host-compensated

| Axis | Capability | What the host supplies | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt-side context | Skills | The skills index arrives as prompt text — the CLI reported "the session context references … `skill_invoke`" (`O4`) | The `skill_invoke` / `skill_search` / `skill_remember` **tools** are absent from the CLI's list; the index is text, not an executable ladder |
| Approvals / safety | Plan and ask enforcement | The host gate blocks non-plan mutations at the permission prompt regardless of what the CLI's own mode is (`O19`, `O24`) | Only covers tools the CLI escalates |
| Approvals / safety | Read auto-approve (`trust_reads`) | A read-only `pwd` auto-resolved with no card (`O8`) | Coarse and mis-calibrated in both directions: the same heuristic labelled a read-only `pwd; ls` "destructive" (`O7`, `O10`, `G10`), and ask mode denied a read-only `ls` outright (`O13`) |

Plus everything in "Host compensation that landed after these sweeps" — none of which has been
re-driven on claude-code.

### Protocol or CLI constraint

| Axis | Capability | Why it does not work | Watch — what must change, where | Measured against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Approvals / safety | Host gate coverage is **contingent, not structural** | Coverage measured total (44 events, all surfaced) only because config isolation is off by default and this operator's real `~/.claude` happened to auto-approve nothing. The spawned CLI loaded that real config, enumerated the operator's own MCP servers (`O4`) and wrote into `~/.claude/plans/` and `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` (`O19`, `O22`). An operator with `permissions.allow` entries gets silent execution with no host card (`G2`) | **Bundle + host seam** (atom `AAP-5`) — make the isolated CLI config the default for host-managed sessions. The opt-in hardening flag already exists and is OFF by default | adapter `0.60.0`, `claude 2.1.233.669` |
| Tools | The CLI's file and shell tools are not confined to the session's workspace | `Read`/`Write`/`Terminal` ran in `~/.gideon/workspace` regardless of the session's `workspace_dir`, and reached `/Volumes/…`, `~/.claude` and `~/.gideon` freely (`O8`, `O17`, `O5`, `O19`, `O22`). The cwd does reach the pool and is dropped below it (`G1`) | **Host seam**. A later kiro measurement found this fixed for a directly-bound session and **still live for an agent-profile-bound one** (`K28`, `K50`, `G39`); claude-code has **not** been re-driven since, so its rows here predate that fix | adapter `0.60.0`, `claude 2.1.233.669` |
| Tools | `AskUserQuestion` card | The card fires only if the CLI exposes an identically-named tool; the CLI's full tool list contains none (`O4`) | **CLI**, or the `gideon-core` surface supplying one | adapter `0.60.0` |
| Tools | Per-turn tool retrieval / progressive disclosure | The CLI enumerated only its OWN tools, including its own retrieval tool; no host-injected `tool_search`/`tool_schema` appeared (`O4`) | **Host seam** via the MCP surface | adapter `0.60.0` |
| Tools | External MCP servers are the **operator's**, not Gideon's | The spawned CLI enumerated the operator's own servers from the real `~/.claude`; nothing from Gideon's `mcp.json` (`O4`) | **Bundle + host seam** — the same isolation and seeding prong as the row above | adapter `0.60.0` |
| Prompt-side context | `project_id` → artifact stamping | Absent in the stronger sense: `artifact_save` was not reachable at all, so there was nothing to stamp (`O4`) | **Host seam** — closes with the `gideon-core` surface (landed, not re-driven here) plus `project_id` threading (atom `AAP-9`) | adapter `0.60.0` |
| Session mechanics | Concurrent sessions on one adapter process | Two concurrently-bound sessions held two different adapter PIDs (`O11`); the dialect declares no concurrency support | **Adapter** would have to interleave sessions; the flag stays false until a spike proves it | adapter `0.60.0` |
| Session mechanics | Persona / agent selection | Discovery returns exactly one agent with `provider_agent: ""` — one base agent per adapter, so the picker has no persona rows to offer, and there is no dead UI (`O2`) | **Adapter / CLI** | adapter `0.60.0` |

### Not yet measured (13 of 63 cells)

No runtime observation exists for these; they are neither working nor absent here. Grouped by
what was missing. **Nine of the original 22 were closed on 2026-08-19** by re-driving them with
the recipes kiro's follow-up sweep had proven — a residual is a missing fixture, not a verdict,
so it stays open only until someone builds the fixture.

1. **Needs a model provider in the sweep home** (~~5~~ **1**): skill-ladder review. The model gap
   itself is gone — the re-drive home resolved both `chat` and `background` to a local model, which
   is what closed unattended mode (`O27`), auto-nudge re-arm (`O28`) and memory consolidation
   (`O29`). The ladder survives for a different reason: `O31` returned `{"proposals": []}` and there
   is **no forced-run surface**, so "the gate was not met" and "the review is inert" are the same
   observation from outside — an instrumentation gap (`G44`), reproduced identically on kiro (`K44`).
2. **Needs a fixture that was not built** (~~9~~ **4**): per-agent approval floor, blocking
   PreToolUse hooks, the other five hook kinds, and incognito/restricted no-write guarantees. The
   six that closed: knowledge `@`-mention, attachment/paste and the agent-profile system prompt
   (`O32`), persona injection (`O33`), `@prompt` expansion (`O34` — absent for a
   provider-independent reason, see the shared constraints) and tool-disable prefs (`O30` — likewise
   absent, the only per-tool surface addresses *configured* MCP servers).
3. **Needs a timing or failure injection that did not land** (5): queued messages and
   queue-steering (`O26` — the probe turn finished 1.2 s early), cancelled-turn preamble
   re-injection, empty-turn auto-retry, pipe-death auto-retry.
4. **No as-a-user entry point** (3): dry-run replay, OS sandbox confinement, and trust/YOLO
   auto-approve — the last deliberately left off so the gate itself stayed measurable.

1 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 13, counted from the matrix rows themselves. Re-deriving the grouping this way
caught two errors in the original 22-cell list that had cancelled out in its total: it counted the
failure-breaker's *loop half* as a cell (it is a sub-clause of a row `O24` already decided) and it
omitted *incognito/restricted no-write*, a real unexercised row. That loop half is still worth a
drive — six consecutive failing tool calls inside a loop, kiro's `K15` shape — but it is not a
thirteenth cell.

## codex

`codex` `0.146.1.360` through `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` `1.1.7`, Zed dialect `codex`.
**The column was measured on adapter `1.1.4` and `codex` `0.146.1.359`, on a host with a working
model provider, and 20 of its 63 cells were never driven.**

### At parity

| Axis | Capability | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt-side context | Memory recall injection at turn 0 | `C4`, `C7`, `C12` — `Injected 10,403 / 15,569 / 11,169 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)` on each fresh session; `C6` shows an injected framing line quoted back verbatim |
| Prompt-side context | Compressed thread-history bootstrap | Every turn spawns a new adapter process and continuity still held across 10 turns; `C6` shows prior-turn text replayed into a later turn |
| Prompt-side context | Task-mode framing — **presence only** | `C6` — the CLI quoted `## Task mode: Agent`, but on a session whose earlier turns ran in agent mode, so replayed history explains it equally well. The fresh-session control died on a tool denial, and codex otherwise refuses to quote its context (`C18`, `G26`). Whether the block's value tracks the live mode is **not** established on codex |
| Approvals / safety | Interactive approval cards | `C5` (two cards in one turn, both resolvable), `C11` (a card rejected, the tool did not run, the turn completed gracefully) |
| Approvals / safety | Session trust auto-approve | `C17` — after one `trust` action the next write ran with no card, surfacing a `tool_call` frame with `"auto": true` |
| Approvals / safety | Task mode enforced before approval, and trust cannot bypass it | `C17` — with session trust ACTIVE an ask-mode write was still denied (`reason: task_mode:ask`) and the file never appeared. This closes the bypass question that claude's column left partial |
| Approvals / safety | SEL audit of every executed tool | `C5`, `C10`, `C17` — hash-chained rows with `tool_kind` and `metadata.risk` for every executed tool. Two blind spots: every permission and decision row is named `unknown` (constraint below), and a CLI-side refusal is invisible (shared table) |
| Learning / memory | Preference-facet capture, correction→lesson review | `C13`, `C14` — `learned` events plus a `per_turn｜lesson` row in the learning staging table and two `semantic_memory` rows. Same poor extraction as claude (`G16`) |
| Session mechanics | Variants / regenerate | `C15` — two variants persisted with `variant_idx: 1` |
| Session mechanics | Edit & resend, fork | `C15` — the fork carries all 14 messages, **and loses the ACP binding** (`G13`) |
| Session mechanics | Queued messages, end to end | `C10` — `queue_push` with a `queue_id` during the turn, then `queue_pop` → the queued message ran as its own turn |
| Session mechanics | Warm pool / instant start | `gateway.log` — the pool path ran but was cold on every turn (`pool_size=0`), so a fresh adapter was spawned per turn |
| Session mechanics | Discovered-agent binding | `C3` — the bind round-trips. *Ephemeral* is literal: it is lost on a fork (`C15`) and on a restart (`C16`) |
| Session mechanics | Turn telemetry (event and tool counts) | `C5`, `C10` — `Turn complete: 103 events, 3 tool calls` |

### Host-compensated

| Axis | Capability | What the host supplies | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt-side context | Skills | The index arrives as prompt text — SEL carries `skill_surface`/`surfaced` rows and the log records `Surfaced skills:` (`C4`) | `skill_invoke`/`skill_search`/`skill_remember` are not in the CLI's tool list |
| Approvals / safety | Plan mode | Plan is enforced **only** by the host gate: plan set before a fresh session's first turn, and the CLI still called `apply_patch` and never called its own plan tool (`C7`) — the host denied it. This is the shape the audit predicted for kiro, not for codex | The CLI has no plan behavior of its own to enter, and a task-mode denial ends the turn (constraint below) |
| Approvals / safety | Read auto-approve (`trust_reads`) | `pwd`, a file read and six `cat` calls auto-resolved as `safe` (`C4`, `C5`, `C10`) | Title-driven — the adapter titles a shell `exec_command` "Read file '…'". **Not** spoofable: `cat X && rm Y` is still classified `execute`/`destructive` and gated (`C11`) |

Plus everything in "Host compensation that landed after these sweeps" — none of it re-driven on
codex.

### Protocol or CLI constraint

| Axis | Capability | Why it does not work | Watch — what must change, where | Measured against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Approvals / safety | There is **no config-isolation lever at all** | The bundle applies none by design, so every host-managed session inherits the operator's real environment: all **12** of the operator's own MCP servers live in-session including write-capable internal ones (`C12`), the operator's skills and plugins load (`C4`), each session drags **31** descendant processes (`C14`), and the CLI writes transcripts of host-driven turns plus shell snapshots into the real `~/.codex/` (`C19`). `G17` | **Bundle + host seam** (atom `AAP-5`): the mechanism must be *built* — codex honors `CODEX_HOME` — there is nothing to flip. Until then the host neither declares nor gates that tool surface | adapter `1.1.4`, `codex 0.146.1.359` |
| Approvals / safety | ~~The approval card cannot name the tool it is approving~~ — **host-compensated; see the compensation table above** | As measured: every `approval` frame and SEL decision row read `tool: "unknown"` with `tool_kind: ""` (`C5`, `C17`), so the card showed a raw payload and the audit trail recorded `unknown ｜ approved`. codex's permission payload is only `{toolCallId, kind, status}`; the human title lives on the *preceding* `tool_call` frame. This also corrects claude's `G10` conclusion — the `kind` **is** present on codex's permission payload | **Closed as a host seam** (`G18`, with `G10`): the title and the kind now ride the same `toolCallId` correlation the input already used. **Not re-driven on codex** — the fix is unit-proven, so this row states a landed mechanism, not a measured cell | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Approvals / safety | A task-mode denial kills the whole turn — **the host's side of it is fixed; the codex symptom is not re-driven** | When ask or plan mode denies a tool the turn produced **no `tool_result`**, ended with `*Conversation interrupted*`, and the model never received a denial it could react to (`C6`, `C7`, `C17`) — while a *rejected card* on the same provider was graceful (`C11`). The host was sending `{"outcome": "cancelled"}` for BOTH, and in ACP `cancelled` means *the prompt turn was cancelled before the user responded*, not *this tool was refused*. So the host was telling codex its turn was over; only the agent's tolerance differed between `exec_command` (survived) and `apply_patch` (interrupted). A denial now echoes the agent's own reject option as a `selected` outcome, preferring `reject_once`. **Not re-driven on codex** — the wire message is unit-proven correct; whether codex's `apply_patch` then completes gracefully is unverified and needs a live drive | **Host half CLOSED** (`G19`). Residual: a request carrying NO options still denies as `cancelled` (the allow-only `default_permission_options()` fallback leaves nothing to echo) | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Session mechanics | The per-session model pin stops applying after the first turn | `ACP model: openai.gpt-5.4` on turn 1, `ACP model: auto (from agent config)` on turn 2 of the same session (`C12`, `C13`), while the activity line keeps printing the pinned id — the user is told a model that is no longer in force, with no restart needed to reach that state | **Host seam** (`G20`; atom `AAP-7`) | adapter `1.1.4`, `codex 0.146.1.359` |
| Session mechanics | Reasoning effort — **the axis still does not exist, but the host no longer pretends it does** | Discovery returns `supported_efforts: []` (`C2`), and a bind with `reasoning_effort: "low"` used to be accepted, persisted and echoed back (`C12`) — a control the provider had reported it cannot honor. **Host half closed** (`G21`): both write paths (`POST …/acp-agent` and `POST …/reasoning-effort`) now refuse an effort outside the runtime's declared set, naming the runtime and the set it declared, and refuse ANY effort when the set is empty. The composer already hid the pill (`effortsForAgent` → `[]`); the API agreeing with it is the part that was missing. `[]` (asked, reported none) and unknown (discovery cold/stale/failed) are deliberately NOT collapsed — the latter fails open to a format check | **CLI** for the axis itself — nothing the host can do makes codex reason at a chosen effort. **Not re-driven on codex**: the refusals are unit-proven | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Tools | `AskUserQuestion` card | codex *has* a `request_user_input` tool and it fails CLI-side ("unavailable in Default mode"); no card, no SEL row, `0 tool calls` counted (`C9`, `G25`). Absent rather than merely unreachable | **CLI** — the tool would have to work in the mode the host runs it in | adapter `1.1.4`, `codex 0.146.1.359` |
| Tools | The CLI's file and shell tools are not confined to the session's workspace | `exec_command`/`apply_patch` ran in `~/.gideon/workspace` regardless of the session's `workspace_dir` and reached arbitrary absolute paths freely (`C4`, `C5`, `C17`) — same defect family as claude's | **Host seam** (`G1`). Later measured fixed on a *directly-bound* kiro session and still live on an agent-profile-bound one (`G39`); codex has not been re-driven | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Tools | External MCP servers are the **operator's** | 12 servers, all from the operator's real config; nothing from Gideon's `mcp.json` (`C12`) | **Bundle + host seam** — the isolation row above | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Prompt-side context | `project_id` → artifact stamping | `artifact_save` was not reachable at all, so there was nothing to stamp (`C4`) | **Host seam** — the landed `gideon-core` surface plus `project_id` threading (atom `AAP-9`); not re-driven on codex | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Session mechanics | Concurrent sessions on one adapter process | Three concurrently-bound sessions held three different adapter PIDs (`C14`) | **Adapter** | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Session mechanics | Persona / agent selection | Exactly one agent with `provider_agent: ""` (`C2`) | **Adapter / CLI** | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Session mechanics | Stopping a turn during a tool call | `stop` returned `{"ok": true}` and emitted `state: stopping`; one second later the turn ended with `ACP prompt timed out` (`C18`) — the user asked to stop and was shown a timeout failure | **Host seam** (`G24`) | adapter `1.1.4` |
| Session mechanics | CLI and adapter notices are rendered as assistant prose | Every fresh session's first assistant chunk is the CLI's own "Warning: Skill descriptions were shortened…" (`C4`, `C7`), persisted as an assistant message, so it also feeds compressed history and the auto-title prompt | **Host seam** (`G23`; atom `AAP-8`) | adapter `1.1.4` |

**Negative results worth keeping** (so nobody re-chases them): the adapter's descendant tracking
*does* reap the MCP fleet — after the gateway was killed, no adapters and no orphaned young MCP
processes remained (`C14`, `C19`); and codex wrote **nothing** into the real `~/.gideon`
despite running with its cwd inside it (`C19`).

### Not yet measured (20 of 63 cells)

1. **Needs a model provider for the loop path** (4): unattended mode, auto-nudge re-arm,
   skill-ladder review, memory consolidation — a loop run failed on provider resolution (`C16`)
   before any ACP worker turn.
2. **Needs a fixture that was not built** (10): knowledge `@`-mention, attachment/paste,
   `@prompt` expansion, agent-profile system prompt, per-agent approval floor, blocking
   PreToolUse hooks, the other five hook kinds, tool-disable prefs, persona injection,
   incognito/restricted no-write guarantees.
3. **Needs timing or failure injection that did not land** (2): empty-turn auto-retry,
   pipe-death auto-retry.
4. **No as-a-user entry point** (2): dry-run replay, OS sandbox confinement.
5. **Blocked by codex's refusal to disclose its own context** (1): cancelled-turn preamble
   re-injection — the cancel was performed (`C18`) but the re-injection could not be read back
   (`G26`).
6. **No deny-listed command was driven** (1): the hard deny-list cell. The `rm` in `C5` reached
   a card rather than a pre-block, but that command is not known to be on the list, so it proves
   nothing either way.

## kiro-cli

`kiro-cli` `2.18.1`, speaking ACP natively — no adapter in the path, so nothing here is an
adapter version. Core's `default` dialect, which has no permission-mode axis. This is the most
completely measured column (2 of 63 cells unmeasured, and both for stated structural reasons)
and the one with a live contradiction.

> **The tool-axis scare is RESOLVED — and it left four wrong rows behind.** An earlier drive on
> 2026-08-19 got `NO_TOOLS` from this same `kiro-cli 2.18.1` and every tool row below was published as
> history rather than fact. A second drive the same day, on a fresh isolated home, reproduces the axis:
> **151 tool names** (kiro's own `shell`/`read`/`write`/`grep`/`glob`, the operator's twelve MCP
> servers, and the entire `gideon-core` surface) and a `pwd` that answers the session's own
> `workspace_dir` — so the confinement question this warning called unanswerable is answered, in
> `K28`'s favour (`K51`). The `NO_TOOLS` reply is best explained as a **gate artifact**: the turn's
> first tool call raises an approval card and parks the turn, and kiro's wording was per-turn (*"in
> this turn"*) (`K52`).
>
> **The real damage was upstream of the scare.** `K4`'s enumeration — the row every tool claim rested
> on — had missed the protocol-delivered `gideon-core` surface, so four rows were scored against
> a list that was short: the native registry, both skills rows and subagents. Three were then
> re-measured by CALLING the tools (`skill_search`, `artifact_save`, `knowledge`, `subagent_run` — all
> execute, each behind its own approval card) (`K57`). Read any remaining "absent tool" claim here as
> *absent from a 151-name census*, not as absent from a 57-name list.

### At parity

| Axis | Capability | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt-side context | Memory recall injection at turn 0 | `K4`, `K22` — `Injected 10,471 / 7,283 / 6,971 / 4,868 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)` |
| Prompt-side context | Knowledge `@`-mention / picker injection | `K30` — with a knowledge item bound to the turn the CLI quoted it verbatim, including its marker string |
| Prompt-side context | Attachment / paste text extraction | `K30` — the CLI quoted the extracted attachment marker verbatim |
| Prompt-side context | Agent-profile system prompt and voice layer | `K30` — a profile carrying a distinctive `system_prompt` was bound and the CLI quoted its mandatory marker verbatim |
| Prompt-side context | Persona injection | `K30` — with the theme set on the turn, the CLI quoted the persona instruction verbatim |
| Prompt-side context | Cancelled-turn preamble re-injection | `K35` — a `sleep 40` tool call stopped mid-turn (`outcome: soft`); the next turn quoted `[PREVIOUS TURN WAS CANCELLED BY THE USER -- context restore]` and the line after it verbatim |
| Prompt-side context | Compressed thread-history bootstrap | Continuity held across 42 messages, and a fresh process on a 12-message session still answered in context (`K24`). The mechanism differs from the Zed adapters: kiro reuses one process per session (`K8`), so most turns need no re-bootstrap |
| Approvals / safety | Interactive approval cards | `K5` (a card raised, resolved, the tool then ran), `K12` (three cards in one turn) |
| Approvals / safety | Session trust auto-approve | `K15` — one `trust` action and the next five tool calls surfaced `"auto": true` with no card |
| Approvals / safety | Per-agent approval floor ("Always allow") | `K36` — a profile with `approval_mode: auto`, background auto-approver **off**: the command executed with no card at all and the session came back `trust: true`. The floor is implemented by flipping session trust |
| Approvals / safety | Task mode enforced before approval | `K14` (ask-mode write denied, file never created, SEL `denied ｜ task_mode:ask`), `K22` (plan-mode write denied). The *trust-cannot-bypass* half was established on codex and not separately re-driven here |
| Approvals / safety | Hard deny-list, pre-execution | `K25` — `git … push` blocked before execution with the pattern named to the user (`Blocked by security policy: *git*push*`) and a SEL `denied` row. **The only positive result for this cell across all three sweeps**; claude measured it absent and codex never drove it |
| Approvals / safety | SEL audit of every executed tool | `K12`, `K13`, `K15` — hash-chained rows for every executed tool *including the ungated ones*, each carrying the real operation title, so codex's "every row is named `unknown`" does not reproduce. One internal contradiction: a single read produced `invoked ｜ risk: safe` and `approved ｜ risk: caution` for the same call (`G35`) |
| Learning / memory | Preference-facet capture, correction→lesson review | `K16`, `K17` — `learned` events plus `facet_veto` and `after_turn_review` rows. Extraction is worse than "poor" here: on an injected-context turn the extractor swallowed the **injected knowledge block** as if it were the user's correction (`K49`, `G16`) |
| Learning / memory | Memory consolidation | `K42` — the explicit consolidate endpoint on a kiro session moved `last_consolidated` 0 → 33, `semantic_memory` 3 → 5, `episodic_memories` 2 → 5. The per-turn cadence has a 30-message threshold on the history log, which is why thirteen short turns never tripped it |
| Learning / memory | Incognito / restricted no-write guarantees | `K33` — an incognito session ran the SAME correction turn that wrote three rows on a persistent session and wrote **zero**; the CLI itself knew its posture. The transcript is still written (that is how the mode is restored) and the session is not restored after a restart |
| Session mechanics | Variants / regenerate | `K34` — two variants persisted; the re-answer still carried the injected knowledge and the profile marker |
| Session mechanics | Edit & resend, fork | `K18` — the fork inherits `workspace_dir` and **loses the ACP binding**; it also copied 8 of the parent's 42 messages, where codex's fork copied all of its parent's |
| Session mechanics | Queued messages, end to end | `K15` — `queue_push` with a `queue_id` during the turn, then `queue_pop` and its own turn afterwards |
| Session mechanics | Warm pool / instant start | `K8` — a second turn on the same session reused the live process and answered immediately. **The only warm reuse demonstrated across the three sweeps** |
| Session mechanics | Per-session model override | `K10` — the bind echoed the model, the activity line named it, and both sessions answered on it. codex's "pin lapses after turn 1" could **not** be re-tested here: kiro does not self-report its model id |
| Session mechanics | Persona / agent selection | `K2`, `K10` — 27 agents offered and the binding round-trips. Only 3 are kiro's built-ins; the other 24 are the operator's private fleet (see the isolation constraint) |
| Session mechanics | Auto-nudge re-arm | `K43` — armed, fired, re-armed, fired, capped at 2 cycles with `active: false`. First runtime demonstration of the loop-side nudge on any ACP provider |
| Session mechanics | Turn telemetry (event and tool counts) | `K4`, `K15` — `Turn complete: 282 events, 1 tool calls` / `196 events, 13 tool calls` |

### Host-compensated

| Axis | Capability | What the host supplies | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tools | The `gideon-core` tool surface | `K32` — the first tool call of the turn was `@gideon-core/get_context`, reached through the protocol `mcpServers` field alone with no seeded user config, and it raised its own approval card | Measured at a later tip than the rest of this column; `K4`/`K6` measured no core surface at all |
| Approvals / safety | Plan mode | kiro has no mode axis, so plan is enforced **only** by the host gate: the CLI called its write tool, the host blocked it, and the reply carried the host's `[SWITCH_TO_AGENT: …]` marker (`K22`) | kiro never enters a native plan mode. "kiro plans" means "the host refuses mutations", nothing more |
| Approvals / safety | Unattended runs | `K41` — a `cron:`-keyed session with the auto-approver off: `auto-denied: unattended run, no one to approve`, `[DONE]` in 5.2 s, nothing left pending, the requested file never created | Fail-fast only: with no permission-mode axis there is no restrictive mode to forward, so an unattended kiro run resolves prompts deterministically rather than being pre-configured to avoid them |
| Approvals / safety | Blocking PreToolUse hooks | `K39` — with the hook ids bound to the session's agent profile, the tool line read `(hook blocked: …)` and the file was never created | **Conditional:** the same hook, unreferenced by any agent, fired three times and the write still landed. Hook firing is agent-scoped by design; the global path is informational and cannot block (`G40`) |
| Prompt-side context | Skills | ~~The tools are absent from the CLI~~ — **corrected**: `skill_invoke`/`skill_search`/`skill_remember` are all present, and `skill_search` was CALLED and answered (`K51`, `K57`). What is unmeasured on kiro is only the INDEX half | No prompt in the sweep matched a skill, so there is no `Surfaced skills:` line and no `skill_surface` row to point at. codex measured that half |
| Tools | kiro's agent discovery of `gideon.json` | The file is generated correctly and stored where kiro never looks (`K6`, `G31`), and the seeding meant to fix that **never runs** — its caller is gated on an argument no bundle passes (`K54`, `G46`). It is also unnecessary: the core tool surface arrives over the protocol instead (`K51`) | **Host seam** (atom `AAP-4`) — wire the seed or delete it; deleting is the clean-break option | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |

### Protocol or CLI constraint

| Axis | Capability | Why it does not work | Watch — what must change, where | Measured against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Approvals / safety | The host gate is **provably not universal** | Seven of thirteen tool calls in one turn executed with **no** permission request — kiro's native `todo_list` — and the host itself labelled each of them `risk: "destructive"`, in the same turns where the read, the write and the `rm` each raised a card (`K13`, `K15`, `G27`). The severity is structural, not about one tool: host safety on ACP is opt-in **by the CLI**, so a provider's ungated set is whatever that CLI chooses not to ask about | **CLI** would have to escalate every tool; failing that, **host seam** needs a positive mechanism (deny-by-default for un-permissioned tool calls) plus the per-provider enumeration rendered below | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Approvals / safety | There is **no config-isolation lever**, and the leak is an identity leak on top of a tool leak | 24 of the 27 personas offered in the picker are the operator's own private agents (`K2`); the CLI's tools are largely the operator's, including cloud-credential and expense-write tools — the re-drive counted **151** of them, twelve MCP servers' worth, from `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (`K4`, `K51`); each session is a five-process tree (`K7`, `G28`) | **Bundle + host seam** (atom `AAP-5`) | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Tools | Per-tool disable prefs | The only per-tool disable surface addresses *configured* MCP servers; neither kiro's own tools nor the protocol-injected `gideon-core` is one — the request returns `server 'gideon-core' not found` (`K45`) | **Host seam** — a per-tool pref that can address an ACP CLI's tools does not exist | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Tools | Read auto-approve (`trust_reads`) does not fire at all | A `pwd` arrived `risk: "safe"`, `is_read_only: "1"` and **still blocked on a card**; a plain file read did too (`K5`, `K12`). The auto-approve is title-driven, and kiro's honest `Running: pwd` / `Reading probe.txt:1` titles do not trip it, where codex's mislabelled "Read file '…'" title for a shell command did — so the honest provider is the one penalized (`G34`) | **Host seam** — classify on the structured `kind`, not the adapter's prose | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Tools | `AskUserQuestion` card | kiro exposes no `request_user_input`-style tool at all — still true against the 151-name census (`K26`, `K51`) | **CLI**, or the core MCP surface supplying one | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Tools | Subagents | **Corrected: `subagent_run` is reachable and it SPAWNS** — protocol-delivered, not absent (`K57`). Two things still block it: it failed outright until this repo fixed the gateway-port defect that pointed the MCP server at a dead port (`K58`), and no `[Subagent completion event]` arrives because the spawn resolves an EMPTY originating session (`K59`, `G49`) — while the bundled `subagent-orchestration` snippet tells the agent to *"just wait"* for one | **Host seam** (atom `AAP-8`) — resolve the originating session on the spawn path | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Tools | Dry-run replay | Absent by entry-point census, not by interception: the only `dry_run` on any user-reachable surface is session cleanup's unrelated preview flag, and the observe-mode argument exists solely on the native runtime constructor, which an ACP session never builds (`K46`) | **Host seam** — no ACP entry point exists to build | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Prompt-side context | Task-mode framing goes **stale** on a reused process | The framing block is injected, and its value drifts: it read `## Task mode: Plan` on a session the API reported as `task_mode: agent` (`K23`), while the same session on a fresh process read `## Task mode: Agent` (`K24`). Because kiro reuses one process per session, this is the common case, not the edge one. Related: a session that has ever been in plan mode wedges (`G29`) | **Host seam** | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Prompt-side context | Workspace confinement on an agent-profile-bound session | Directly bound, the CLI's own `pwd` answers the session's `workspace_dir` — the earlier escape is gone (`K28`). Bind a Gideon **agent profile** and the same `pwd`, asserted inside the spawned CLI, answers `~/.gideon/workspace` — the operator's real home (`K50`, `G39`) — because the profile's empty default directory wins over the session's explicit value | **Host seam**. This is the shape a fix can miss: a sweep that drives only the plain binding measures the escape as gone | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Session mechanics | Concurrent sessions on one process | Declared and absent, which is worse than claude's and codex's honest "no": the config flag was set, the dialect declares support, an in-process check returns true — and three bound sessions still ran on three separate five-process trees (`K7`, `G32`). The fallback is silent at every surface | **Host seam** — a log line on the fallback before anything else | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Session mechanics | Reasoning effort | `supported_efforts: []` on all 27 agents (`K2`), yet a bind with `reasoning_effort: "low"` is accepted, persisted and echoed back (`K10`) | **CLI** for the axis; **host seam** to stop offering the control (`G21`) | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Session mechanics | Pipe-death retry / re-queue | `kill -9` on the session's process tree mid-turn ended the stream with `ACP prompt timed out`; nothing was retried or re-queued and no replacement process appeared for that turn. The **next** turn respawned transparently (`K38`, `G42`) | **Host seam** | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Approvals / safety | Two of the six script-hook kinds never fire on the ACP path | Over 25+ turns: `SessionStart` 1, `UserPromptSubmit` 17, `Stop` 15 — and `PostToolUse` **0**, `Error` **0**. The `Error` miss is not for lack of errors: a `-32601` and a real `-32603` model-unavailable both failed to fire it (`K40`, `G41`) | **Host seam** (`AAP-8`) | `kiro-cli 2.18.1` |
| Approvals / safety | OS sandbox wrap — **`ENV`, not a verdict** | The host logs `No OS-level sandbox available — app-level checks only` at boot on this platform, so there is no host wrap engaged and no confinement boundary to probe (`K47`).

Neither is a missing fixture, and neither is reachable by driving the product as a user.

1. **Skill-ladder review** — with a live model provider and 25+ turns including corrections, the
   proposals endpoint never left `{"proposals": []}`, and the route census shows accept, promote
   and verify but **no forced-run surface**. From outside the system "the gate was not met" and
   "the review is inert" are the same observation, so no verdict can be recorded either way
   (`K44`, `G44`). It needs instrumentation, not another sweep.
2. **Empty-turn auto-retry** — no empty turn occurred across 25+ turns and ten sessions,
   including a blocked write, a hook-blocked tool, an auto-denied unattended call, a cancelled
   turn and two protocol errors (`K48`). Producing one requires stream injection, so it is out of
   reach for an as-a-user sweep by construction.

## gemini-cli — unverified

A `gemini-cli` runner row ships in the catalog (`runtime_id: acp:gemini-cli`, binary `gemini`,
ACP entered through the CLI's own `--experimental-acp` flag, no adapter) and a `gemini-cli-agent`
bundle exists. **Nothing in this document applies to it.** The binary is not installed on the
measuring host, so **zero of the 63 cells have any observation** — not one row is at parity,
host-compensated, or absent; they are all unmeasured.

Two things are known without driving it, and both are shipped-data honesty notes rather than
capability claims:

- Its `--experimental-acp` flag is **declared from the vendor's documented behavior, not
  measured here**. The catalog's health probe runs `<binary> --version` and nothing else — it
  never opens a session, so a `ready` probe would prove only that the binary answers a version
  query.
- Its catalog row carries **no dialect and no adapter**, so which protocol dialect the host
  would negotiate with it is also unverified.

Treat a gemini-cli session as untested: the constraints in "Constraints that hold on all three
providers" are likely to apply, since most of them are host-side or protocol-level, but that is
an expectation, not a measurement.

## The not-gateable residual, per provider

An ACP CLI decides for itself which of its tools ask the client for permission. Everything it
does not ask about runs before the host ever sees a decision point, so the deny-list, the
task-mode gate and blocking PreToolUse hooks — all of which hang off the permission request —
never run for it. The host cannot enumerate that set by inspection; it can only measure it.

The measured residual is a registry in core (`acp/permission_authority.py`, `NOT_GATEABLE`) and
the block below is RENDERED from it by `scripts/render_acp_parity_residual.py`, so the gate and
this document cannot drift apart. **Every provider is listed even when its residual set measured
empty, so "no entry" can never be read as "gated".** Do not hand-edit inside the markers;
`tests/test_acp_parity_residual_render.py` fails the build when they disagree.

- **`claude-code`** — 2 declared residual entries.
  - Measurement: AAP-5 Phase-1 SEL re-read (O96): 7 persisted rows with outcome='ungated', provider='claude-code', across 4 sessions and 2 tool titles. RETRACTS the earlier AAP-1 zero-residual claim, which runtime disproved: chat_runner records 'ungated_declared' whenever not_gateable_entry() matched, so a plain 'ungated' row is proof the registry held nothing for that title.
  - `Terminal`
    - Reason: claude-code runs its shell tool without emitting a session/request_permission for it. The host's deny-list, task-mode gate and blocking PreToolUse hooks all hang off that frame, so none of them ran. NOT accepted: a shell command that reaches the OS with no host decision point is not a limitation we are willing to go quiet about.
    - Observation: O97: the execute-kind share of O96's 7 'ungated' rows carries title='Terminal' and reason='no session/request_permission for this tool_call'.
    - State: measured, NOT accepted — the host cannot gate it and nobody blessed it, so it stays loud
  - `Read File`
    - Reason: claude-code self-approves its own file reads — the same missing frame — so a read of a path the host would have questioned is never offered for a decision. NOT accepted: effective risk resolves to SAFE so it never aborts a turn, but nobody ever blessed it, and an unblessed hole stays loud.
    - Observation: O98: 'Read File' is the second of the two titles in O96's 7-row 'ungated' set for provider='claude-code'.
    - State: measured, NOT accepted — the host cannot gate it and nobody blessed it, so it stays loud
- **`codex`** — 1 declared residual entry.
  - Measurement: AAP-5 Phase-1 live drive (O99-O102): 4 plain 'ungated' rows on provider='codex' — a read, an in-workspace write, an out-of-workspace write and a network call. RETRACTS the earlier AAP-2 zero-residual claim.
  - `codex-native`
    - Reason: codex is its own first-line permission authority: under HOST_AUTHORITY_MODE='default' it escalates almost nothing, so its whole native tool surface — reads, writes, shell, network — can execute before the host has a decision point. NOT accepted: an out-of-workspace write that completed with no card is the exact shape §2.2 exists to make loud.
    - Observation: O99-O101: four plain 'ungated' rows in one AAP-5 Phase-1 drive — a read, an in-workspace write, an out-of-workspace write ('printf … > /private/tmp/aap2b-outside-probe.txt', which EXECUTED) and a network call ('curl https://example.com'). Vacuity floor for the same drive (O102): codex DOES escalate on retry, and 'git push' was escalated and correctly deny-listed — so 'escalates almost nothing' measures codex, not a dead harness.
    - State: measured, NOT accepted — the host cannot gate it and nobody blessed it, so it stays loud
- **`kiro-cli`** — 2 declared residual entries.
  - Measurement: AAP-3 sweep (K13, K15) + AAP-5 live re-drive 2026-08-18: one turn, 6 tool calls, 1 gated, 5 ungated (4x todo_list + 1 file read)
  - `todo_list`
    - Reason: kiro's native task-list tool emits a tool_call frame and a SEL 'invoked' row but never a session/request_permission, so no host gate — deny-list, task-mode, PreToolUse — can run for it.
    - Observation: G27: seven of thirteen tool calls in one turn ('Creating task list: …', 'Completing #1/#2/#3') executed with no permission request, each labelled risk='destructive' by the host, in the same turns where the read, the write and the rm each raised a card.
    - State: measured, accepted — a documented limitation; the host labels it and stays quiet
  - `fs_read`
    - Reason: kiro self-approves its OWN file reads: the read raises no session/request_permission even though the write in the same turn does, so a read of a path the host would have questioned is never offered for a decision.
    - Observation: AAP-5 live re-drive 2026-08-18 against real kiro-cli: in one turn 'Creating todo_probe.txt' raised a card while 'Reading todo_probe.txt:1-10' (kind='read') did not — 6 tool calls, 1 gated, 5 ungated. Effective risk resolves to SAFE, so this residue is labelled, never turn-aborting.
    - State: measured, accepted — a documented limitation; the host labels it and stays quiet
<!-- END GENERATED: not-gateable-registry -->

Two honest qualifications on those empty sets:

- **Empty means "no ungated tool was observed in that sweep", not "this CLI escalates everything
  by construction".** claude's total coverage was explicitly contingent on the operator's own CLI
  config auto-approving nothing (`G2`); a different operator config changes the answer without
  changing the CLI.
- **A provider with no registry entry at all is not covered by this statement.** `gemini-cli` has
  none because it has never been driven.

## Where the columns disagree

The asymmetries are the finding, not noise: a fix keyed on one provider's shape is frequently
wrong for another, and a conclusion drawn from two columns was false on the third.

| Capability | claude-code | codex | kiro-cli |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native plan mode | Enters its own plan mode — **only** if plan is set before the first turn (`O19`, `G12`) | No native plan; host gate only (`C7`) — the shape the audit predicted for kiro | No mode axis; host gate only (`K22`) — as predicted |
| Read auto-approve | Fires, and mis-calibrated in both directions (`O7`, `O10`, `O13`) | Fires, title-driven, and not spoofable by a compound command (`C5`, `C11`) | **Never fires** — honest titles are the ones that miss the heuristic (`K5`, `G34`) |
| Hard deny-list, pre-execution | Measured **absent** (`O21`) — before the deny-list learned to read the real command rather than the permission title | **Never driven** | Measured **wired**, with the pattern named to the user (`K25`) |
| Gate coverage | Total, but contingent on the operator's CLI config (`G2`) | Total — no ungated tool observed | **Provably not universal**: 7 of 13 calls in one turn ungated (`G27`). The two-provider conclusion "no ACP tool executed without passing the host gate" is false here |
| Approval-card identity | Real title present; `kind` missing on the permission frame (`O5`, `G10`) | Title missing (`unknown`); `kind` **present** (`C5`, `G18`) | Real titles throughout (`K12`) |
| Concurrent sessions | Declared false, absent (`O11`) | Declared false, absent (`C14`) | **Declared true**, absent (`K7`, `G32`) |
| Persona axis | None — one base agent (`O2`) | None — one base agent (`C2`) | 27 agents, 24 of them the operator's private fleet (`K2`) |
| Reasoning effort | Adapter advertises five; honoring unobservable (`O2`, `O20`) | None advertised; host still accepts a value (`C2`, `C12`) | None advertised; host still accepts a value (`K2`, `K10`) |
| Config isolation | Opt-in flag exists, **off** by default (`O4`, `O19`) | None, by design (`G17`) | None (`G28`) |
| Process model | New adapter process per turn; pool cold (`O17`) | New process per turn; pool cold; 31 descendants (`C14`) | One process reused per session — the only warm reuse measured (`K8`) |
| Fork message copying | All 24 messages (`O25`) | All 14 messages (`C15`) | 8 of 42 messages (`K18`) |
| Can the provider validate a prompt-side cell? | Yes — it quotes its injected context (`O14`) | **No** — it refuses to disclose its context, which is why three cells stayed open (`C18`, `G26`) | Yes — and doing so is how the framing-goes-stale defect was found (`K23`, `G38`) |

## Refreshing this document

Each row above is a measurement with a version attached, so this document rots exactly as fast as
the CLIs move. The refresh procedure is the audit's own checklist, re-run per provider:

1. **Record the versions first** — CLI, adapter (per-home, not `PATH`), and the host commit. A
   row whose version is not recorded is not a measurement.
2. **Drive as a user**, one isolated home per sweep, through the dashboard and the API. *Reading
   code is not a mark.* A cell with no runtime observation stays in the "not yet measured" list.
3. **Re-measure the auth precondition before any capability probe** where a CLI needs one. A
   stale credential masquerades as protocol failure, and such a cell is `ENV`, never a verdict.
4. **Do not overwrite history when a re-drive disagrees.** Record both observations and say which
   is later — kiro's tool axis is in this document precisely because the second drive contradicted
   the first, and hiding that would have been the only real failure.
5. **Regenerate the not-gateable section from the registry**, never by re-deriving it in prose.
