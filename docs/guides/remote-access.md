# Reaching your dashboard from outside your home network

By default Gideon is a **local** program: it binds to your machine, and you get in with a
token link (`gideon token`). That is the safest arrangement, and if you only ever use it at
home you should stop reading here — nothing in this guide makes a local install better.

This guide is for the other case: you are away from home — on your phone, on cell data — and want
to reach your own dashboard. There are two shapes of answer, and **you almost certainly want the
first one:**

1. **A private network (a tailnet).** Your phone and your gateway join the same encrypted overlay
   network and talk directly. Nothing is exposed to the public internet; there is no TLS
   certificate to obtain and no port to open. This is the recommended path for personal use.
2. **A public tunnel.** You deliberately publish the dashboard to the internet behind TLS and a
   password. More moving parts, a larger attack surface — the right choice only when you cannot
   put both devices on a tailnet.

---

## The simplest path: a tailnet (recommended)

A tailnet (Tailscale is the common one) is a private, end-to-end-encrypted network your devices
join. Once your phone and your gateway are both on it, the phone reaches the gateway at a stable
`100.x.y.z` address **as if they were on the same LAN** — over the tailnet's own encryption, with
nothing published to the public internet.

This works **today**, unchanged, with the default `AUTH_MODE=local_token`. You do not set
`dashboard.public_url`, you do not obtain a TLS certificate, and you do not port-forward anything.

```
your phone ──(tailnet, encrypted)──▶ your gateway at 100.x.y.z:PORT
   both devices are members of the same tailnet; no public exposure
```

**Steps**

1. **Put the gateway on the tailnet.** Install Tailscale on the machine running Gideon and
   bring it up:
   ```bash
   tailscale up
   tailscale ip -4          # prints this machine's tailnet address, e.g. 100.101.102.103
   ```
2. **Put your phone on the same tailnet.** Install the Tailscale app, sign in to the same account,
   and confirm both devices appear in your device list.
3. **Let the gateway listen on the tailnet interface.** By default the gateway binds loopback
   only. Bind it so the tailnet can reach it (token auth stays on — the token is the front door):
   ```bash
   GIDEON_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 gideon gateway --port 10000
   ```
4. **Open it on your phone with the signed-in link.** On the machine, mint a token URL and rewrite
   the host to the tailnet address:
   ```bash
   gideon token          # prints http://localhost:10000?token=…
   ```
   On the phone, open `http://100.101.102.103:10000?token=…` (same path and token, tailnet host).

**`gideon doctor` does this detection for you.** It now finds the tailnet interface and
prints the phone-usable base URL directly:

```
Remote access
  remote:      ✅ tailnet 100.101.102.103 — open http://100.101.102.103:10000 on your phone
               (run: gideon token, for the signed-in link)
```

If instead it says `local-only`, your gateway isn't on a tailnet yet — walk back through the steps
above. If it says the bind is **exposed beyond loopback with auth OFF**, fix that first (see the
anti-patterns below) before going any further.

**Why this is the safe default.** The tailnet is already a private encrypted network, so the two
risks the public-tunnel path spends effort mitigating — cleartext on the wire, and a stranger
finding your URL — simply do not arise. There is no public listener to find. The token link is
still your authentication, and everything under *What this does not protect you from* still
applies.

---

## The other path: expose to the internet (public tunnel)

Use this **only** when you cannot put both devices on a tailnet. It publishes the dashboard to the
public internet, so it needs TLS, a password, and the hardening below.

> **The honest summary.** Exposing this to the internet moves it from "a program on my machine"
> to "a service someone can knock on". Everything below is about making that a deliberate,
> bounded decision rather than an accident. Gideon does **not** terminate TLS itself and
> does not open a port for you — you bring a tunnel. (Tailscale can also do this via *Tailscale
> Serve/Funnel* — but if you're using Tailscale, prefer the private-tailnet path above.)

### The shape of it

```
your phone ──https──▶ your tunnel (terminates TLS) ──http──▶ Gideon on 127.0.0.1
                      cloudflared / Tailscale / Traefik
```

Three things you provide, in order:

1. **A tunnel that terminates TLS.** cloudflared, Tailscale Serve, Traefik, Caddy, nginx — any
   of them. Plain http across the internet would put your session cookie on the wire in
   cleartext, so TLS is a precondition, not a nice-to-have.
2. **A password**, so a stranger who finds the URL cannot walk in.
3. **`dashboard.public_url`**, which is how you tell Gideon it is exposed. That single
   setting is what turns on the hardening described below.

### Step 1 — set a password

```bash
gideon auth set-password            # prompts twice, never echoes
gideon auth enable                  # start offering the sign-in page
gideon auth status                  # confirm both
```

Minimum 12 characters. Length beats symbols — a passphrase you can remember is better than a
short string you keep in a note app. The password is stored as an argon2id hash under
`~/.gideon/auth/credentials.json` (mode 0600) and never leaves your machine.

**Your token link keeps working.** Sign-in is an *additional* front door, never a replacement.
If you forget the password, walk to the machine and run `gideon token`.

### Step 2 — declare the public URL

In `~/.gideon/config.json`:

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "public_url": "https://pc.example.com",
    "trusted_proxies": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```

Setting `public_url` changes three things:

| | Effect | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Session cookie | gains `Secure` | so the browser refuses to send it over plain http |
| WebSocket CSP | allows `wss://<your-host>` | otherwise the dashboard loads and then silently receives nothing |
| `X-Forwarded-*` | honored **only** from `trusted_proxies` | see below |

`trusted_proxies` is the address your tunnel connects **from**, as Gideon sees it — usually
`127.0.0.1` for a local tunnel daemon, or the container/bridge address in Docker (e.g.
`172.18.0.0/16`). Single addresses and CIDR blocks both work.

**Why this list matters.** Your tunnel tells Gideon the real client address via a header;
without it every request looks like it came from the tunnel. But any process that can reach the
gateway could *claim* to be your tunnel and set that header to anything — which would let it move
a session's IP binding. So on an exposed instance the header is believed **only** from a peer you
named here. Leave it empty and no forwarded header is trusted at all (safe, but sessions bind to
the tunnel's address rather than the real client's).

`public_url` is deliberately **not** editable from the Settings UI — widening a network surface
should be a deliberate file edit, not a click.

### Step 3 — 2FA (recommended if you are actually on the internet)

```bash
gideon auth totp setup     # prints a secret + otpauth:// URI, ONCE
```

Add it to any authenticator app, **verify a code works**, and only then require it (Settings →
Account → *Require a 2FA code*, or `auth.require_totp: true`).

Requiring a code before enrolling a secret would make sign-in impossible; `gideon auth
status` warns you about exactly that state, and the local token link remains the way to fix it.

### Step 4 — pairing a phone without typing your password into it

Typing a long passphrase into a phone keyboard, over a tunnel, in public, is the worst place to
spend your password. Instead:

```bash
gideon auth enroll          # prints e.g.  7K4M-QP93
```

On the phone, open your public URL, tap **Use a device code instead**, and enter it. The code:

- works **once**;
- expires in **5 minutes**;
- is stored only as a hash, so nobody can read it back off the disk;
- mints an ordinary session with the same lifetime as a password sign-in.

Losing a code costs nothing — run the command again. `gideon auth enroll --clear`
invalidates any outstanding ones.

### Sessions, and ending them

Sessions survive a gateway restart (they are recorded under `~/.gideon/auth/`, mode 0600).
That is deliberate: being logged out by an unattended update, while away from home, is exactly
the situation this feature exists to prevent.

```bash
gideon auth revoke --all    # end every session, everywhere
```

Use that if a device is lost. It survives a restart too. Your password and 2FA enrollment are
untouched, so you just sign in again.

Sign-out from the UI revokes **that** session properly — the token dies, not just the cookie.

### Failed attempts

After `auth.lockout_threshold` failures (default 5) from one address, sign-in is refused for
`auth.lockout_window` (default 15m) and returns `Retry-After`. Wrong-code attempts on the pairing
form count too. Every attempt — success, failure, lockout — lands in the security event log
(`gideon security events`).

## Getting a push when a run needs your approval

Remote access gets you *to* the dashboard. This gets the dashboard to *interrupt you* — which is
the point, because the thing that actually caps how much your agent can do unattended is how long
a blocked run waits for a decision.

**Every push carries two ids and nothing else: `{"kind": "approval", "item_id": "<id>"}`.** Not the
tool name, not its arguments, not the session, not a title. Your phone wakes up, and then it fetches
the decision from *your* gateway over the link you set up above. A push service — Google's, Apple's,
Mozilla's, or your own ntfy host — never sees what is being approved. That is not a nicety: it is the
only claim that holds for every transport below, since not all of them are encrypted.

Pick a transport in **Settings → Companion apps → Phone push**. The guide leads with ntfy
because it is the documented default recommendation: fully self-hosted, no keys, no third
party. Web push is what a browser or installed PWA uses; the relay is only for the store app.

### ntfy / UnifiedPush (recommended — fully self-hosted)

The documented default: no third party is involved at all. Run [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/docs/install/)
and point the gateway at a topic:

1. Settings → Companion apps → **Push backend → ntfy**.
2. Paste your topic's full **https** URL, e.g. `https://ntfy.example/gideon`. Plain `http` is
   refused at both the settings field and the sender — an unencrypted ping would put the item id on
   the wire in the clear.
3. Subscribe to the same topic in the ntfy app on your phone.

Nothing else to set up: no VAPID keys, no per-device subscription. The tradeoff is cosmetic and
deliberate — the ntfy app shows the raw `{"kind":…,"item_id":…}` body, because the alternative is
composing a human sentence and a sentence is content. A pretty notification is not worth putting
the tool's arguments through someone else's server.

Pick a topic name nobody can guess. An ntfy topic URL is a capability: anyone who knows it can
publish to it, so a guessable topic means anyone can make your phone buzz. It still cannot approve
anything — approving happens on your gateway, behind your session.

### Web push (browsers and the installed PWA)

What `mobile.push_backend` defaults to, and the right transport when your phone runs
the dashboard as a PWA or browser tab. Uses your browser's own push subscription. One-time setup on the gateway:

```
gideon push init          # generates a VAPID keypair into the credential store
gideon push status        # backend, keypair, subscribed devices
```

Then, on the phone: open `#/companion`, tap **Turn on push**, and allow notifications. The
subscription is stored per device, so each phone or browser you turn it on from gets its own row.

Two real constraints, stated rather than discovered:

- **iOS needs the PWA installed.** Safari will not hold a push subscription for an ordinary tab.
  Add the dashboard to your home screen first (Share → Add to Home Screen), then turn push on from
  the installed app. The companion screen says so instead of showing a button that cannot work.
- **A service worker needs a secure context.** Over a tailnet hostname or a TLS tunnel you are
  fine. Over plain `http://` at a LAN address there is no service worker, so no push and no install
  — Settings → Companion apps → *Install & offline* names that as the reason.

Rotating the keypair (`gideon push init --force`) invalidates every existing subscription,
because each browser bound its subscription to the old public key. Only do it if a key leaked, and
re-subscribe each device afterwards.

### The store app (APNs/FCM via a push relay)

The iOS/Android store app cannot hold a web-push subscription — Apple and Google only
deliver to it through their own push services, and only whoever holds the app's signing
credentials can send there. Relay users route the same ids-only ping through a
**stateless, open-source relay** ([`gideon-push-relay`](https://github.com/sidiora-labs/gideon-push-relay))
that forwards it to APNs/FCM. Deploy it yourself with your own credentials, or use the
hosted convenience instance — the relay stores nothing, retries nothing, and refuses any
body that is not exactly the two ids, so it is a dumb pipe by construction, not a cloud
middle tier.

1. Settings → Companion apps → **Push backend → relay**, and paste the relay's **https**
   URL (plain `http` is refused at the sender, same as ntfy).
2. In the store app, open the companion screen and tap **Turn on push** — the app
   registers its device token with *your gateway*, which holds it; the relay sees a token
   only in transit, per ping.

The visible notification is a static "Gideon — Attention needed": any text worth
varying would have to be composed from the item, i.e. content the relay must never see.
Tapping it opens the exact approval card, fetched from your own gateway.

### Checking it without a phone in your hand

```
gideon push test                        # one content-free ping to every subscribed device
gideon push test --kind approval --item-id abc123
```

It prints the backend, how many devices took the ping, and the exact payload that was sent, so you
can read the ids-only claim rather than take it on trust.

### What a tap does

The notification opens `#/companion?approval=<id>` and scrolls that specific card into view with
the whole decision on screen — tool, full arguments, where it came from, how long it has been
waiting. Approve or deny, and the run you were pinged about continues. If the approval timed out
while your phone was in your pocket, the screen says so rather than leaving you hunting for a card
that no longer exists.

Which notifications reach the phone at all is **Settings → Notifications**: every kind has a row,
and *Approval needed* ships with the phone among its targets. Turn it off there and nothing else
changes.

## Anti-patterns — do not do these

- **Never port-forward your router straight to the gateway.** Opening a port on your home router
  to `PORT` on the machine puts an unencrypted `http://` listener on the public internet with no
  TLS and no tunnel in front of it. That is the worst of both paths: cleartext cookies on the wire
  *and* a public address anyone can scan. Use a tailnet (encrypted, private) or a TLS-terminating
  tunnel — never a bare forwarded port.
- **`AUTH_MODE=none` cannot be exposed — and that is a feature, not a limitation.** When auth is
  off, the gateway is *forced* to bind loopback (`127.0.0.1`) no matter what you set; an
  unauthenticated gateway can never reach a non-loopback interface. If you want remote access, keep
  the default `local_token` (the tailnet path) or set a password (the tunnel path). Don't reach for
  `none`.
- **Never expose over plain http.** Publishing an `http://` (not `https://`) URL to the internet
  leaks your session cookie on the wire — see the `Secure`-cookie note under *What this does not
  protect you from*. A tailnet sidesteps this entirely (it is encrypted end to end); a public
  tunnel must terminate TLS.

If `gideon doctor` reports `remote: ❌ bound beyond loopback with auth OFF`, you have hit the
first two anti-patterns at once (a `GIDEON_BIND_HOST` override with `AUTH_MODE=none`). Fix it
before exposing anything: either bind loopback again, or set a password and use one of the two
supported paths.

## What this does not protect you from

Being straight about the limits, because a false sense of safety is worse than none:

- **A weak password.** Rate limiting slows online guessing; it does nothing about a password that
  appears in a breach list. Use a passphrase.
- **A compromised device.** A session cookie on a stolen unlocked phone is a session. Revoke.
- **Your tunnel provider.** Anything terminating your TLS can see your traffic. That is inherent
  to the arrangement, not specific to Gideon.
- **The agent's own reach.** Sign-in controls who reaches the *dashboard*. What the agent may do
  once inside is governed separately — see [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md), the approval modes,
  and the autonomy guardrails.
- **Plain-http exposure.** If you set an `http://` public URL, the cookie will not carry `Secure`
  (setting it would break sign-in entirely) and your session is exposed on the wire. Don't.

## Troubleshooting

**My phone can't reach the tailnet address.** Confirm both devices are up on the *same* tailnet
(`tailscale status` on the machine lists your phone), that the gateway was started with
`GIDEON_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` (it binds loopback-only by default), and that `gideon
doctor` prints `remote: ✅ tailnet …`. If doctor says `local-only`, the gateway isn't on the
tailnet yet.

**The page loads but nothing updates.** The WebSocket is blocked, and there are two separate
reasons it can be — check both:

1. Confirm `public_url` matches the host in your browser's address bar exactly, including port —
   the CSP is derived from it.
2. **Also set `dashboard.url` to the same public URL.** `public_url` puts `wss://<host>` in the
   Content-Security-Policy, so the browser is *allowed* to open the socket, but it is
   `dashboard.url` that adds your public origin to the origin allowlist the gateway checks on the
   upgrade. With only `public_url` set the browser opens the socket and the gateway refuses it,
   which looks identical to a CSP problem. State-changing requests return `403` for the same
   reason.

(Both apply to the public-tunnel path; the tailnet path needs no `public_url`.)

**I get signed out immediately, or the cookie never appears.** An `https` `public_url` sets
`Secure`, so the cookie is dropped over plain http. Either serve the dashboard over TLS or unset
`public_url`.

**Everything says "not enabled".** `gideon auth status`. Enabling sign-in requires a
password first, by design.

**I am locked out and away from home.** Wait out the window (default 15m). If you are truly
stuck, you need local access — that is the intended floor: nothing remote can override the
lockout.
