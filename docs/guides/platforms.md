# Platforms

The runtime includes Linux and macOS service paths, with Linux-container and WSL2
options for Windows hosts. Use the [checkout setup](../../README.md#run-from-a-checkout)
or an operator-supplied package or image. No public package index, image registry,
installer endpoint, or release repository is assumed.

## Qualification scope

Platform support must be established for the revision and deployment being used.
Focused local checks in this rewrite do not certify the full platform matrix.

| Environment | Source path | Qualification boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | Python gateway; systemd integration; Linux container images | Verify architecture, dependencies, isolation, and the intended user flows |
| macOS | Python gateway; launchd integration; desktop packaging target | Verify local behavior and any distribution signing requirements |
| Windows with WSL2 | Linux runtime inside a WSL2 distribution | Verify filesystem, networking, and service behavior on that host |
| Windows with Docker Desktop | Linux images using the WSL2 backend | Build locally or select operator-published image references |
| Native Windows | No desktop packaging command in the current workspace | Not a qualified native release |

The [desktop guide](desktop.md#platforms) distinguishes runtime deployment from native
application packaging. The guidance below describes environment setup rather than
recording a completed release validation.

## The `[models]` extra, per architecture

`python -m pip install -e '.[models]'` from the checkout pulls the local-embedding stack. Wheel
availability — not Gideon — is what varies by arch. Read from the committed
`uv.lock` (the resolver's own record, so it stays honest as versions move):

| Package | x86-64 | arm64 (macOS) | arm64 (Linux) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `faiss-cpu` | ✅ wheel | ✅ `macosx_14_0_arm64` | ✅ `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` + `musllinux_1_2_aarch64` | musllinux wheel means Alpine works too |
| `torch` | ✅ wheel | ✅ `macosx_14_0_arm64` | ✅ `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` | CPU build; no CUDA on arm |
| `sentence-transformers` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `py3-none-any` — pure Python, arch-independent |

**So `[models]` installs from wheels on every arch we claim** — no source build, no
compiler needed. Verify it yourself without an arm box:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import re
blk = re.search(r'\[\[package\]\]\nname = "torch"(.*?)(?=\n\[\[package\]\]|\Z)',
                open("uv.lock").read(), re.S).group(1)
print([w for w in re.findall(r'([\w.\-]+\.whl)', blk) if "aarch64" in w or "arm64" in w])
PY
```

### RAM floor on Pi-class boards

The embedding stack, not the gateway, is what strains small boards. The gateway
itself is light; `torch` + a loaded embedding model is the heavy part.

- **< 2 GB RAM** — skip the extra. Install the checkout without the `models` extra and use a remote
  provider for embeddings. Everything except local embedding works unchanged.
- **2–4 GB (Pi 4/5 class)** — `[models]` can work, but add swap before first use;
  the model load is the spike, not steady state:
  ```bash
  sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
  sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile
  # persist: echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
  ```
  Prefer a small model, and expect the first ingest to be slow.
- **≥ 4 GB** — no special handling.

If you hit an OOM kill during ingest rather than at startup, it is the model load —
add swap or drop the extra; it is not a database or gateway problem.

## Windows via WSL2

Windows has no native build. The supported path is **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem
for Linux, version 2): a real Linux kernel inside Windows where Gideon
runs as an ordinary Linux install. The Windows-side browser reaches the
dashboard through WSL2's automatic localhost forwarding.

If you would rather not run a Linux shell at all, use
[Windows via Docker Desktop](#windows-via-docker-desktop) below — Docker Desktop
itself uses a WSL2 backend, but you never touch the Linux shell. The rest of
this section is for running Gideon directly in WSL2.

### 1. Install in WSL2

From a WSL2 shell (Ubuntu or any distro), install exactly as on Linux — with
`uv`, which brings its own Python 3.12:

```bash
uv tool install gideon
gideon setup      # interactive: name + first provider credential
gideon gateway
```

`gideon doctor` prints a `platform: WSL detected` line and tells you
whether the background service will work (see below).

### 2. Keep your home on ext4, NOT on /mnt/c — this matters

Store `~/.gideon/` on the WSL **ext4** filesystem (i.e. under your Linux
home, `/home/<you>`), **not** under `/mnt/c` (the mounted Windows drive).

The `/mnt/c` mount crosses the Windows/Linux filesystem boundary (a 9P network
protocol), and small random I/O across it is dramatically slower — often
10-20x. Gideon's SQLite databases and FTS index do exactly that kind of
I/O, so a home on `/mnt/c` makes chat history, memory, and search crawl.

Leave `GIDEON_HOME` unset (defaults to `~/.gideon`) or point it at
another ext4 path. Do not set it to a `/mnt/c/...` path.

### 3. Opening the dashboard (localhost forwarding + wslview)

WSL2 automatically forwards `localhost` between Windows and the Linux VM, so the
dashboard URL the gateway prints (`http://localhost:10000/...`) opens directly
in a **Windows** browser.

On boot the gateway prints the URL prominently and then tries to open it. Inside
WSL there is no Linux browser to launch, so Gideon hands the URL to
[`wslview`](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu) (from the `wslu` package),
which opens it in your Windows default browser. Most WSL distros ship `wslu`; if
`wslview` is missing, install it (`sudo apt install wslu`) or just click the URL
the gateway printed. Auto-open never blocks startup — a missing `wslview` is not
an error.

### 4. Background service needs systemd (opt-in on WSL2)

`gideon service install` registers a systemd unit so the gateway starts on
boot and restarts on failure. WSL2 runs systemd only when you opt in. Enable it
once:

1. Create or edit `/etc/wsl.conf` inside your distro:

   ```ini
   [boot]
   systemd=true
   ```

2. From **Windows** (PowerShell or CMD), fully restart the distro so the change
   takes effect:

   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

   Reopen your WSL shell. `gideon doctor` should now report
   `service: systemd active`.

Without systemd the background service will not persist. In that case, either
run the gateway in a foreground shell (`gideon gateway`) whenever you need
it, or start it on Windows login via **Task Scheduler** with a
`wsl -d <distro> -- gideon gateway` action.

## Windows via Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop runs the configured Linux images or builds them from this checkout,
so the Windows host does not need a Python installation. You do need Docker Desktop with
its **WSL2 backend** (its default; the legacy Hyper-V backend is not tested).

### 1. Get the compose file and a `.env`

Obtain the checkout from the operator-configured repository, then run from its root:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set at least one provider key. **Paths in `.env` must be
container paths, not Windows paths** — the gateway runs inside Linux, so
`C:\Users\you\...` means nothing to it. Leave `GIDEON_HOME` alone; compose
already sets it to `/data`, backed by a named volume.

> **Why the `.env` must sit at the repo root:** `compose.yaml` declares
> `env_file: ../../.env`, i.e. two levels up from `infrastructure/compose/`. If you copy
> the compose file somewhere else on its own, that relative path breaks and your
> keys silently do not load.

### 2. Start it

```powershell
docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml -f infrastructure/compose/compose.build.yaml up -d --build
```

This builds the local gateway and web images. To use published images instead, set
`GIDEON_GATEWAY_IMAGE` and `GIDEON_WEB_IMAGE` to complete references supplied by the
operator, then omit the build overlay. No registry is selected by default.

### 3. Open the dashboard

Ports are published on **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`), which is what you want on
a laptop:

| URL | What |
|---|---|
| `https://localhost:3443` | the dashboard (HTTP/2; SSE + WebSocket streams) |
| `http://localhost:3000` | 308-redirects to the HTTPS port above |
| `http://localhost:10000` | the gateway API directly |

The HTTPS certificate is **self-signed** out of the box, so the browser shows a
warning on first visit — expected; click through. (Mount a real cert over
`/etc/nginx/certs/gideon.{crt,key}` to replace it.)

Docker Desktop forwards published ports to Windows `localhost` automatically, so
no port-proxy or firewall rule is needed for loopback access.

### 4. Volume semantics — use the named volume, not a bind mount

State lives in the `gideon_home` **named volume** mounted at `/data`. Keep
it that way on Windows. A bind mount from an NTFS path (`-v C:\...:/data`) crosses
the Windows↔Linux filesystem boundary, and Gideon's SQLite databases do
small random I/O plus file locking across it — which is both much slower and a
known source of locking oddities. The named volume lives inside the WSL2 VM's
ext4 disk and behaves like native Linux storage.

Useful volume operations:

```powershell
docker volume inspect compose_gideon_home     # where it lives
docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml down  # stop, KEEP the volume
docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml down -v  # stop and DELETE state
```

Prefer `gideon snapshot` (run inside the gateway container) over copying
the volume by hand:

```powershell
docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml exec gideon-gateway gideon snapshot
```

### 5. Updating

For a local build, obtain the intended repository revision and rebuild:

```powershell
docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml -f infrastructure/compose/compose.build.yaml up -d --build
```

For operator-published images, update the configured image references, then run
`docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml pull` followed by
`docker compose -f infrastructure/compose/compose.yaml up -d`.

The named volume survives, so your state carries across the upgrade.

### Known limits on this path

- **No `gideon service install`.** Container restart policy replaces it —
  `restart: unless-stopped` already brings the stack back when Docker Desktop
  starts. Enable *Start Docker Desktop when you log in* for boot behaviour.
- **The desktop shell does not run on Windows** (it ships for macOS and Linux —
  see [the desktop guide](desktop.md#platforms)) and is unrelated to this path.
- **Docker Desktop's Hyper-V backend is untested**; use WSL2.
