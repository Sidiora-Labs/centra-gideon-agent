# Workflows-V2 — session execution queue

**The single source of truth for autonomous execution order.** A nudge reads this file,
finds the first session whose status is not DONE, and executes it.

This file exists because 77 sessions do not fit in one context window. Every session ends
with its status written here, so the thread survives compaction: the queue is on disk, not
in anyone's head.

## Working rules (do not renegotiate these per session)

1. **Branch from the PREVIOUS session's branch, never from `main`.** Name it
   `feature-wf2-<slug>`. The stack merges in order with no conflicts.
2. **One atomic commit per PR.** Fixes to the same PR AMEND that commit and
   `git push --force-with-lease`. Never a second commit on the same PR — with one commit a
   squash-merge produces an identical tree, which is what keeps the next rebase trivial.
3. **A PR covers 2-3 related sessions** (the group is marked below). Commit each session's
   work into the group's single commit by amending.
4. **Gate before every commit:** `make lint` + `make test` green. No exceptions.
5. **Real-model validation every session** against the tiered Bedrock bindings
   (see below). If a session produces nothing observable yet, validate the seam it exposes
   — never claim validation that did not happen.
6. **`git commit -s`**, owner identity, no agent trailers.
7. Record DONE here + deviations in the owning plan's `## Execution log`.
8. **On a blocker:** if the work can proceed correctly without it, proceed and record a
   DEVIATION. If proceeding would break architecture or force a poor implementation, mark
   BLOCKED here with the reasoning and move to the next unblocked session. Never guess at
   an architectural decision to preserve momentum.

## Model tiers (bound + verified 2026-08-01)

| Workflow `model_tier` | Use case | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | `background` | `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` |
| `standard` | `orchestration` | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` |
| `reasoning` | `reasoning` | `global.anthropic.claude-opus-5` |

Also bound: `chat`/`code_tools` → sonnet-5, `loops` → opus-5. Embeddings available via
`global.cohere.embed-v4:0`. Dev home `.dev-home-bedrock`, `AWS_PROFILE=golani`.
Bare model ids are REFUSED by Bedrock — the `global.`/`us.` inference-profile prefix is
mandatory.

## Execution log (one line per session; newest last)

- 2026-08-01 — queue created. Sessions 1-77 defined. Model tiers bound + verified
  (haiku/sonnet/opus → fast/standard/reasoning). Engine Slices 0-1 already DONE.
- 2026-08-01 — sessions 1-3 (G1, Slice 2) DONE. `resilience.py` + `verify.py`, wired into
  the controller and gate dispatcher. 10049 tests (+76). Real-model validated: mutation-hint
  retry (haiku recovered on attempt 2 with the correction in-prompt), breaker stopped a
  20-iteration thrash at 3 with zero model calls, opus-5 judge PASSed a sound claim and
  REJECTed an absurd one via the closed enum, ladder refused to average away a hard failure,
  artifact gate rejected claimed-but-absent files and refused a traversal pattern.
  DEVIATIONS: (a) `check_budget` now sets `warn` even when already over — a single large node
  can jump past the cap, and treating over as "no warning needed" left the user with a paused
  run and no notice; (b) `model_tier_standard` defaults to `orchestration` not `background`,
  or `standard` and `fast` collapse to one model and the three tiers are decorative;
  (c) added `GateKind.LADDER` + `GateKind.JUDGE` rather than overloading `verify_command`.
- 2026-08-01 — session 4 (Slice 3a, the effect ledger) DONE → **PR #139**. `effects.py`:
  `sha256(run_id+instance_path+epoch)` identity, the 5-state effect lifecycle in
  `events.jsonl`, the committed-effect redo boundary, teardown-before-redo, strict
  one-object BYOI stdout parsing, and `CallerDedupe` for the Slice-6 tool surface.
  10075 tests (+26). Validated live against the REAL bash provider: fired 1x and committed
  `output_id=res-42`; an epoch bump without `redo_effects` blocked (`committed_effect`) with
  the provider never dispatched — still 1x; with `redo_effects` the teardown received
  `res-42` and the node re-fired exactly once.
  DEVIATIONS: (a) **`BLOCKED` added to `TERMINAL_STATES`** — it means "the engine refused,
  a human must decide", so leaving it schedulable made the frontier relaunch-and-refuse
  forever (the silent hang the state exists to prevent); its absence also made
  `_ROOT_TO_RUN[BLOCKED]` unreachable. 351 workflow tests confirm no regression.
  (b) PR base is `main`, not `feature-wf2-slice2`: #138 squash-merged mid-session, so the
  branch was rebased `--onto origin/main` to shed the duplicated pre-squash slice-2 content.
  **Stacking lesson: when the predecessor PR merges mid-session, rebase onto the squashed
  main rather than opening against a deleted branch.**
  (c) **DCO landmine, cost one CI failure:** `git commit --amend -F -` REPLACES the message
  and silently drops the `Signed-off-by` trailer. Always `--amend -s`. Verify with
  `git log -1 --format='%(trailers:key=Signed-off-by,valueonly)'` before pushing.
- 2026-08-01 — session 5 (Slice 3b) DONE → **PR #140**. `scope.py` (snapshot/diff write-scope
  with symlink resolution, warn-vs-reject, opt-in), `audit.py` (`workflow_audit` diagnose/heal,
  dry-run-default, live-controller protection, `blocked{protocol_violation}`), `secrets.py`
  (`_has*` strip / node-id-keyed re-inject / inline-secret lint), and the v2 `run-workflow`
  provider re-registered + re-allowlisted in one commit. 10148 tests (+73).
  Validated live on real disk: a provider clobbering a real file above the workspace was
  caught by name in warn (complete + ledgered) and reject (scope_violation); a real symlink
  escape resolved out of scope; an 8h-stale node healed to blocked/protocol_violation while
  dry-run changed nothing.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **`_epoch` used `time.mktime` on UTC `...Z` stamps** in BOTH
  `audit.py` and `controller.py` — mktime reads the struct as LOCAL time, so the offset
  cancelled the measured age and the stale-running check was permanently inert; in the
  controller it only showed as an hour-wrong duration across a DST boundary. Both now
  `calendar.timegm`, regression-pinned. (b) **Consolidated the duplicate credential-shape
  list**: `validator.py` had its own prefix tuple, so two vendor-shape lists would drift
  until one stopped catching a provider. It now reads `secrets.py`; the stale validator
  keeps-entry was removed and `secrets.py` added, carrying over `gho_`/`hf_` (a test caught
  that the consolidation would have dropped them). (c) `watch_roots` is necessarily WIDER
  than `allowed_write_paths` — snapshotting only allowed paths makes a violation
  undetectable by construction; it reaches one level above the workspace, not `$HOME`, and
  the limitation is stated in the module rather than papered over.
- 2026-08-01 — session 6 (Slice 4a, `mutations.py`) DONE → **PR #141** (stacked on #140,
  which was still open — normal stacking, no rebase needed). Typed op vocabulary, the
  binding-dependency cascade, transactional batch (parse → validate → apply-to-copy →
  re-validate), grammar hardening a-d, spec-history writer, force-only epoch bump.
  10199 tests (+51). Validated live on a real completed 4-node run: **tree subtree of
  `gather` = ['gather'] vs BINDING closure = ['analyze','gather','report']** — a tree reset
  would have missed both consumers (the WF2-R2 stale-input bug, demonstrated rather than
  asserted); editing a done node rejected `WF_MUT_FROZEN_NODE`; a spec-breaking delete
  wrote nothing.
  NOTES: `rewind`/`run_from`/`fork` are spec-level no-ops here by design — they change
  INSTANCE STATE and run identity, which Slice 4c owns; `inline_subworkflow` is a typed
  refusal until Slice 10. Both are explicit, not silent.
- 2026-08-01 — session 7 (Slice 4b, the mutation queue) DONE → **PR #142** (stack:
  #140→#141→#142). `submit_mutation` (validate + queue + synchronous preview + confirm gate
  + `expect_version`), `_drain_mutations` at the documented safe point with the **TOCTOU
  re-verify**, rewind/run_from state reset, `store.archive_output` (attic, not delete),
  `inputs_stale` journaling, spec-history writing. 10224 tests (+25).
  Validated live: unconfirmed rewind refused with nothing queued; confirmed reset exactly
  ['analyze','report'] leaving gather/unrelated done; 2 outputs archived; re-run cost
  exactly 2 model calls; `spec_history/v002.json` + 1 journaled edit.
  DEVIATION/BUGFIX: **`_terminal` stayed set after a loop exited**, so a controller
  restarted in place after a rewind returned the PREVIOUS run's status instantly without
  waiting for the new work. `start()` now clears it. Found by the end-to-end rewind test —
  not by inspection, which is the argument for driving the real thing.
  NOTE: rollback-vs-revert is only half-landed. `rewind` (rollback: hard reset with
  preserved forward refs) is done; `revert` (inverse-patch ONE node's effects, 409 with the
  conflict named on overlapping later state) needs the checkpoint machinery from 4c to
  identify what "later state" is, so it moves to session 8. Recorded rather than faked.
- 2026-08-01 — session 8 (Slice 4c) DONE → **PR #143** (stack #140→#141→#142→#143).
  **Slice 4 is complete.** `checkpoints.py`: checkpoints (instance map + spec version, NOT
  outputs), `fork_run` (own run dir, `root_run_id` propagation, copied journal prefix +
  outputs, `fork_axis` disambiguator, SHARED_AXES surfaced), `prune_fork` (traversal-refusing),
  `revert_node`/`revert_paths` (409-style refusal with dependents NAMED). The `fork` op is
  wired through the mutation queue; the child lands in DRAFT deliberately (a fork exists to
  be edited before it runs — auto-starting would race that edit). All six plan-named
  property tests landed. 10267 tests (+43).
  Validated live: **a fork of a complete run resumed with ZERO model calls** (the cache-key
  claim proven, not asserted); parent byte-identical after fork; `root_run_id` stable across
  a fork-of-a-fork; revert of a consumed node refused with `dependents=['b']` while the leaf
  was allowed; `prune_fork('../../etc')` refused.
  NOTE: session 7's carried-over `revert` is now landed here, as planned. The remaining
  Slice-4 gap is the journal-region attic (`journal/attic/v<NNN>/`): outputs are archived and
  the in-memory cache is invalidated, but the journal FILE stays append-only by contract, so
  region archival belongs with the retention sweep rather than here. Recorded, not faked.
- 2026-08-01 — session 9 (Slice 5a, the human-input contract) DONE → **PR #144**
  (stack #140→#141→#142→#143→#144). `human_input.py`: typed Ask (4 kinds, per-field types +
  defaults + validation), continuation records with `resolved_inputs` + handoff bundle,
  ATOMIC single-use consumption via unlink, typed `resume_expired`, mode-dependent gate
  timeouts. `controller.resume()` is the out-of-band entry point for widget/inbox/HTTP/chat.
  10313 tests (+46).
  Validated live: a real run blocked with a handoff naming what had already run; an invalid
  answer was refused with the token INTACT; a **fresh controller** (standing in for a gateway
  restart between question and answer) approved it and the immediate second resume was
  refused; the run completed with `deployed=true`; an expired token returned a typed item.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **surfacing and terminating had to be split.** Giving
  background gates a default deadline meant an unanswered gate had a wake time and stopped
  reporting `needs_input` — it waited silently. `_surface_needs_input` publishes without
  ending the run, so a gate is visible NOW and can still time out later. A regression pair
  pins both, because an earlier cut broke whichever behaviour was written last.
  (b) `wait` nodes are excluded from needs-input surfacing — parked on the clock, they
  resolve themselves. (c) Rewind drops tokens PREFIX-SCOPED, not globally: dropping every
  token on any rewind would cancel approvals a rewind cannot affect. Both directions tested.
- 2026-08-01 — session 10 (Slice 5b) DONE → **PR #145** (stack #140→…→#145).
  **Slice 5 is complete.** `gate_policy.py`: risk-scoped auto-approve (reusing
  `tool_providers.RiskLevel`, NOT a new vocabulary), owner binding + default-DENY for remote
  channels, `AllowMemory` (run-scoped, cleared on rewind), event-gate transient hold with
  event preservation + bounded give-up, and `clarification_from_output` so ANY action node
  can ask without a pre-placed gate. 10360 tests (+47).
  Validated live: schedule-fired runs sailed through safe/caution and STOPPED at destructive
  AND undeclared; an intruder's channel reply was refused with the token surviving for the
  real owner; rewind cleared the remembered allow; an absent prerequisite held with
  `preserve_event=True` while an invalid payload gave up; remote timeout denied.
  KEY DECISION: **an undeclared gate defaults to DESTRUCTIVE.** Deny-by-default toward
  higher risk means forgetting to classify a gate makes it ASK; the opposite default would
  turn every unclassified gate in an unattended run into an unreviewed action.
- 2026-08-01 — session 11 (Slice 6a, the chat tool surface) DONE → **PR #147**
  (stack #141→…→#147). `workflows/service.py` (the ONE implementation Slice 7a's REST routes
  will also call), `mcp_workflows.py` (19 tools, coded never-raising results),
  `MCP_WORKFLOW_SCHEMAS` in validation.py, all 19 `manifest_meta` entries. All FOUR
  registration points wired incl. the regenerated offline reference. 10424 tests (+63).
  Validated live end to end: manifest generated from the engine's enums; plan → dry-run
  author (nothing written) → save → list; a `ghp_` literal REFUSED; a blocking run through
  the real engine completed with correct output; fork named its 3 shared axes; 4 error paths
  coded and readable; audit defaulted to dry-run.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **`_run` used bare `asyncio.run`**, which raises "cannot be
  called from a running event loop" when the caller is async. Production is safe (the native
  runtime uses a thread executor) but a surface contracted to never raise must not depend on
  its caller — it now detects a running loop and completes on a worker thread. FOUND BY
  DRIVING IT FROM AN ASYNC SCRIPT, not by a unit test (which called it from sync context and
  never hit it). Pinned by an async-context test.
  (b) `error_codes` in manifest_meta stay EMPTY: that registry is the `ERR_`-prefixed
  AgentError ENVELOPE, a different channel from these `WF_*` result-body codes. Declaring
  them there would put one failure in two vocabularies (the drift test enforces the
  registry, which is append-only).
  (c) Two Phase-1 assertions that `mcp_workflows` is ABSENT were correct then, obsolete now.
  Retargeted to the surviving invariant: `prompt_render` does not live there and every tool
  is `workflow_`-prefixed.
  (d) This category does NOT go over HTTP like its siblings — the engine is in-process, and
  a gateway round-trip to reach an object in the same process buys nothing.
- 2026-08-01 — session 12 (Slice 6b, preflight + drift gate) DONE → **PR #148**
  (stack #141→…→#148). `preflight.py`: credentials (declared ∪ REFERENCED `{{secret:}}`),
  binaries, models (via the SAME `can_resolve_use_case` probe onboarding uses), action
  providers. `start_run` gated with a `skip_preflight` override; agent-authored defs get a
  dry-run report attached at save; nine manifest-drift assertions against the engine's enums.
  10458 tests (+34).
  Validated live against REAL infrastructure: the real probe refused an LLM workflow in a
  home with no model; the real PATH flagged an absent binary and passed `sh`; the real
  registry rejected `no-such-provider`; the real credential store flagged an
  undeclared-but-referenced `{{secret:}}`; a pure-transform workflow demanded nothing.
  KEY DECISIONS: (a) **missing is an ERROR, unverifiable is a WARNING** — refusing a run
  because the CHECKER was offline is its own outage, so the two never collapse (tested both
  ways). (b) The model check reuses onboarding's probe deliberately; a private capability
  check would drift from what the bridge really resolves and greenlight unrunnable runs.
  (c) A BOUND provider name is SKIPPED, not guessed at — guessing a binding's future value
  produces a false failure. (d) A judge gate is checked on the `reasoning` tier because that
  is what `dispatch_gate` actually uses, not what the node declares.
  NOTE: 11 Slice-6a tool tests now pass `skip_preflight=True` — they inject a fake completion
  to test the ENGINE, while preflight tests the ENVIRONMENT (correctly model-less in a test
  home). Two new tests cover the ungated path so the gate is not merely skipped everywhere.
- 2026-08-01 — session 13 (Slice 6c) DONE → **PR #149** (stack #147→#148→#149).
  **Slice 6 is complete.** `workflows/context_block.py`: the `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` block
  (urgency-ordered, ask inline, run+length capped, names its own tools) and the staged-turn
  spec echo (tree + source + `expect_version` + live node states, credentials stripped).
  `controller.wait_for_terminal()` + `progress_snapshot()` for blocking mode. Wired into
  `context.py:build_message`. 10493 tests (+35).
  Validated live: a real gated run returned `needs_input` from blocking mode instead of
  hanging; the block rendered as a chat turn sees it with the ask inline; the echo on a real
  `workflow_status` carried `expect_version=1` and `#approve [waiting]`; a broken store
  yielded "" not an exception.
  KEY DECISIONS: (a) **blocking mode needed a NEW wait.** `run_to_completion` waits for the
  tick loop to exit, which DEADLOCKS on needs_input — the tool holds the turn that would
  render the ask, so the ask can never be answered. `wait_for_terminal` stops there and
  returns the resume token in the same response.
  (b) The block is NOT project-filtered: `resolve_project_id` AUTO-CREATES a project when
  none resolves, and a read-only context block must not have side effects.
  (c) The echo ships tree AND source together — tree-only invites invented field names,
  JSON-only makes structure unreadable. Mutation tools do not re-echo (the model already
  knows what it changed).
  (d) never-break-a-turn is asserted on the CALL SITE in context.py, not just the helper.
- 2026-08-01 — session 14 (Slice 7a, the REST API) DONE → **PR #150** (stack #149→#150).
  `workflows/handlers.py`: 19 routes for defs + runs over the SAME `workflows.service` the
  chat tools use, §2.2 error envelope with a one-place `_STATUS_MAP`, restricted-session
  guard + SEL audit on every mutation, snapshot-then-subscribe per-run SSE that CLOSES for a
  terminal run. Mounted in `dashboard/server.py`. 10543 tests (+50).
  Validated live against a REAL aiohttp server over HTTP: save 201 → list → blocking run to
  complete → status with both nodes done → `output='got 7'` → SSE emitting
  `event: workflow_snapshot` then closing → fork 201 → manifest → a 404 in the exact §2.2
  envelope → `/runs` returning a run list rather than a def named "runs".
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **TWO WIRING GAPS CLOSED.** The supervisor was built at boot
  but never published, so `state.workflows` AND `ActionServices.workflows` were both None —
  the routes would have created runs nobody drives and the `run-workflow` trigger provider
  would have kept reporting "no supervisor available". Both now get it.
  (b) **A pre-existing legibility gap fixed here because it hid this slice's work:** the
  offline reference's AST walk was rooted at `dashboard/`, so entity families registered from
  their own package were INVISIBLE. Widening it to the package surfaced **43 routes** — this
  slice's 19 plus artifacts' and tasks' 24, which had NEVER been documented. Asserted both
  ways so a future narrowing is caught.
  (c) An unmapped service code returns 400, never 500 — a 500 tells a client to retry
  something that can never succeed.
  (d) mypy caught two real bugs pre-run: `_is_restricted_session` takes `(state, request)`,
  and `dashboard_state` is Optional at that point.
  (e) TEST LANDMINE: `make_mocked_request`'s default app is a MagicMock, so
  `app.get("state")` returns a mock and the handler 500s on an awaited mock — masking what it
  actually did. Pass a REAL `web.Application`.
- 2026-08-01 — session 15 (Slice 7b, the workflows UI) DONE → **PR #152** (stack #150→#152).
  **Slice 7 is complete.** `pages/workflows/`: list (runs-first, needs_input sorted top),
  def detail (tree + inputs + requirements), live run detail (snapshot-then-subscribe),
  `WorkflowAsk` (ONE renderer for all 4 ask kinds), `useWorkflowStream` (full 10-event
  union), `workflowMeta` (status presentation, degraded≠failure). api.ts types + 18 methods.
  Nav entry under Capabilities. 10547 py tests · 329 web tests (+22) · typecheck + build clean.
  VALIDATED AS A USER in a real browser: nav renders; list showed "1 waiting on you"; the run
  view rendered the typed approval with its handoff and live states; clicking Approve drove
  the run to Complete via SSE with `deliver` appearing, the header swapping to Fork, and
  elapsed filling in; 0 console errors.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES:
  (a) **BLOCKER CLEARED — the native def provider did not exist.** `defs.py` is only a
  registry SEAM, so with no app installed NOTHING writable was registered and every save
  failed `WF_DEF_NO_WRITABLE_PROVIDER` — a dead end for the whole feature. Slice 0 deferred
  it ("a loader with no executor can't be validated end to end"); the executor exists now, so
  `native_defs.py` landed here. Version advances on EVERY save (a run pins the version it
  started from; reusing one makes `expect_version` meaningless).
  (b) **A REAL BUG THE UI FOUND THAT UNIT TESTS MASKED.** Answering a gate wrote the node DONE
  but never restarted the tick loop — already exited when the run went needs_input — so the
  run sat forever with downstream nodes unlaunched. Every earlier test called
  `run_to_completion` BY HAND after resuming, and that manual call WAS the missing restart.
  `resume()` now clears needs_input + relaunches; 3 regression tests fail without the fix.
  **Lesson: a test that hand-drives the thing under test can hide the absence of the very
  mechanism it is testing.**
  (c) Added the workflow SSE drift guard to `test_transport_doctrine.py` (backend publishes ⊆
  FE listens), verified by deleting an event and watching it fail.
  (d) Three font sizes were off the documented ramp (0.875/0.6875rem) — snapped to real rungs.
  (e) The preflight model probe is now PINNED in its test rather than relying on ambient
  environment state.
- 2026-08-01 — session 16 (Slice 8a) DONE → **PR #153** (stack #152→#153). The event
  envelope stamped at the ONE `_publish` seam (`event_id` deterministic, `seq` monotonic,
  `epoch` = the RUN's max, plus `node_epoch` on node events); `workflowFold.ts` (pure,
  unit-locked, 4 guards); `WorkflowProgressCard` folding SSE through the SAME fold the run
  page uses. 10559 py · 368 web (+39) · typecheck + build clean.
  Validated live: captured 7 REAL frames off the wire (evt-9…evt-14) carrying the full
  envelope; browser showed the resumed run Complete 3/3; `foldRealFrames.test.ts` asserts the
  fold law against those exact frames.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES:
  (a) **`workflow_node_started` overrode the run epoch** — it passed the NODE's epoch as
  `epoch`, so `started` and `done` for one node reported DIFFERENT run epochs; a consumer
  folding the lower one would treat the next real event as superseded and go permanently
  silent. Node epoch now goes under `node_epoch`, and a STRUCTURAL test fails if any call
  site re-introduces a bare `epoch` in a payload (the dicts are spread into the envelope, so
  a regression would otherwise be invisible).
  (b) **`seq` was in the envelope but the fold never used it.** Folding REAL captured frames
  OUT OF ORDER regressed a node from Done back to Running. Added a PER-NODE seq floor —
  per-node, not global, because two different nodes' events are independent and a global
  floor would drop a legitimate sibling. **Found by replaying real frames, not fixtures.**
  (c) `window.location.hash` in the card violated the url-navigation doctrine test; replaced
  with a plain `<a href>` matching SdlcProgressCard.
- 2026-08-01 — session 17 (Slice 8b) DONE → **PR #154** (stack #152→#153→#154). New
  `coalescer.py` (per-observer debounced batching, ~25ms window, `workflow_batch` frame) wired
  into the watchdog's publisher; new `projection.py` (explicit field-table validation before
  transmission) behind the per-run SSE snapshot; `store_output` spill extended from size-only
  to content-based binary detection; FE `unwrapBatch` + batch listener; transport-doctrine test
  extended. 10616 py · 380 web (+12) · typecheck + build clean.
  Validated live: a 12-item foreach delivered **26 logical events in 3 wire frames**
  (run_update / 24-member batch / terminal run_update), every member carrying the full envelope
  with seq dense 1-26 and the batch flushed BEFORE the terminal status. Those exact frames are
  checked in as `__fixtures__/realBatchFrames.json`. In a real browser a 30s fan-out went
  Running/Waiting → Complete/Done live, zero console errors.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES:
  (a) **The binary check's first version detected nothing.** A PNG's leading `\x89`
  utf-8-encodes to TWO bytes (`\xc2\x89`), so a utf-8 round-trip matched no magic number at
  all. Recovered with latin-1 instead (codepoints 0-255 map back to the identical bytes). Found
  by the test failing, not by review.
  (b) **Base64 added as a second carrier** beyond the plan's "magic-prefix binary detection": a
  node output is JSON, and JSON cannot hold arbitrary bytes, so in practice a screenshot or
  fetched asset arrives base64'd — a raw-bytes check alone would miss every realistic case.
  (c) **Coalescing keyed by `(event, instance_path)`, not path alone.** Path-only would let a
  node's `started` be eaten by the `done` that follows in the same window, so the node would
  never render as active — a fan-out would look like it teleported from pending to finished.
  (d) A pass-through event FLUSHES the pending batch (not in the plan's wording, but required):
  otherwise a status flip overtakes the node events that logically precede it.
  (e) Two existing tests were pinned to the un-coalesced shape and were updated to unwrap
  (`test_workflows_watchdog.py::test_events_reach_the_per_run_sse_key`) or to the new projection
  seam (`test_workflows_api.py::test_it_is_snapshot_then_subscribe`) — the CLAIM each makes is
  unchanged.
  (f) `workflow_node_progress` was NOT added to the FE union or the allowlist: no call site
  publishes it yet (it arrives with Slice 8c's foreach progress rows), and registering it now
  would be a dead path.
- 2026-08-01 — session 18 (Slice 8c) DONE → **PR #155** (stack #152→#153→#154→#155). New
  `attention.py` (a waiting gate raises a durable inbox row + ONE notification via
  `emit_attention_item`, deduped per run/path/EPOCH, resolved on answer scoped to the node, and
  cleared when a run ends); `WorkflowGateActions` answering the gate IN the inbox through the
  same `WorkflowAsk` the run view uses; `service.delete_run` + `DELETE /api/workflows/runs/{id}`
  + two-step armed delete in the run list; per-item foreach rows (`[3/12] auth.py`) with the
  label persisted on the instance. 10669 py · 387 web · typecheck + build clean.
  Validated live: a gate raised a `pending` row carrying the real question; approving FROM THE
  INBOX completed the run and flipped the row to `handled`; the two-step delete 404'd the run and
  removed its directory; deleting a `needs_input` run was refused 409 naming the fix; a named
  fan-out rendered `[1/3] auth.py` … `[3/3] handlers.py`.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES:
  (a) **The plan's "typed ask renderer" and "degraded rendering" were already done** in Session
  15 (`WorkflowAsk.tsx`, `nodeLook`'s degraded-as-success-adjacent tone). This session built what
  was genuinely missing — and the watchdog's comment claiming user-facing moments "go through
  notify separately" described work that had NEVER been done: a gate reached nobody who wasn't
  already watching the run view.
  (b) **EVERY attention row was written to a detached store.** `emit_attention_item` built a
  fresh `InboxStore()`, but the running service holds items in MEMORY and never re-reads the
  file — so the row hit disk and `/api/inbox` (which serves the service's instance) stayed empty,
  and the service's next save would overwrite it. Affected every attention kind (loop gates,
  proposals, mirrored approvals), not just workflows. Fixed with a shared `inbox.live_store(state)`,
  **isinstance-checked** because a test's `MagicMock` answers every getattr and would swallow real
  writes silently.
  (c) **`message=body or title` discarded the title** whenever a body existed — a gate's row read
  "Waiting for your approval." and LOST the actual question. Now joined title-then-body.
  (d) **The resolve side had (b) all over again**: closing a row in a detached copy left it open
  after its gate was answered. Found by clicking Approve in a REAL BROWSER and watching the row
  survive. `resolve_gate_item`/`resolve_run_items` now take the state.
  (e) `NodeInstance.item_label` added (persisted): the items list is re-resolved from a binding,
  so after an upstream output changes the label would be unrecoverable, and a retry must show the
  item it originally got rather than whatever now sits at that index.
  (f) `WorkflowWatchdog.forget(run_id)` added — nothing may hold a controller handle to a run whose
  row is about to disappear.
  (g) The offline reference needed regenerating for the new DELETE route (its drift guard caught it).
- 2026-08-01 — session 19 (Slice 9a) DONE → **PR #156** (stack #152→#153→#154→#155→#156).
  New `macros.py` (4 macros expanding at DEFINITION time in `author_def`, before validation and
  before the write — so the journal/resume-cache/rewind never learn macros exist and a user can
  hand-edit an expansion); new `bundled/` with all six templates + `bundled_defs.py` (read-only
  provider served straight from the package, registered at gateway boot). 10796 py · 387 web.
  Validated live: all six served as `source=bundled`; `produce-and-audit` triaged `standard`,
  took the `look_around` leg and SKIPPED the two untaken entry subgraphs with macro-expanded nodes
  rendering as ordinary rows; two templates parked correctly on approval gates.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES:
  (a) **Flat action arguments deadlock a run.** `code-implementation` wrote bash args flat beside
  `provider`, but the engine reads them from `config.with` (`dispatch_action`). Bash got an EMPTY
  config and reported "missing 'command' field" for a command visibly in the spec — then every
  downstream binding failed and the run died as "deadlocked". Three cascading symptoms, none
  naming the cause. Fixed + the validator now refuses the shape at authoring time
  (`WF_ACTION_ARGS_NOT_NESTED`, naming which keys to move; argument-less = warning only). One
  existing validator test's fixture used the broken shape and was corrected.
  (b) **The wheel would have shipped an EMPTY template library.** `pyproject.toml` declared
  `workflows/bundled/*/WORKFLOW.md` — a filename nothing has ever produced. Editable installs
  looked perfect; only a real `pip install` would have shown it. Corrected to `workflow.json` and
  pinned by a test, since `pyproject.toml` is the only place it is observable.
  (c) A boolean `branch` enum does NOT work: `[true,false]` stringifies to Python's `True`/`False`
  and will never match `"true"`/`"false"` case keys. `audit-sweep`'s fix toggle uses an expression
  GATE instead, which is the honest construct for a boolean.
  (d) No `bundled/shared/` prompt-block library yet and no template-lint — both are Slice 9b's
  explicit scope, so they were left rather than half-built here.
- 2026-08-01 — session 20 (Slice 9b) DONE → **PR #157** (stack #152→…→#156→#157). New
  `bundled/shared/` (3 conventions blocks) + `blocks.py` (resolved at definition time, AFTER macros
  since a macro emits references); `template_lint.py` (advises on a user's spec via `author_def`,
  GATES the shipped library at zero findings incl. warnings); `artifact_update_provider.py`
  (zero-token upsert, registered in registry AND `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` in one commit); the FE run
  dialog (`templateStart.ts`); `workflow_plan` now honours its `template` arg. 10862 py · 406 web.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES:
  (a) **Declared input defaults were validated and then NEVER APPLIED.** A template declaring
  `acceptance` with a default, run without it, failed three nodes deep on `binding failed:
  unresolved reference at 'acceptance'` — so every optional input was a landmine and a template
  could only run if the caller passed every key it declared. Found by starting a bundled template
  from the UI with the optional field blank. Now `_with_declared_defaults` at run start, recorded on
  the run so the record explains its own behaviour.
  (b) **`event_type` is a fixed enum** (`ALLOWED_EVENT_TYPES`): the invented `workflow_refresh` made
  every artifact UPDATE fail while creates succeeded. Now `iterated`.
  (c) A stray `{{block:…}}` surfaced as `WF_UNKNOWN_BINDING_ROOT`, sending an author after a node
  that was never the problem. Own code now (`WF_UNRESOLVED_BLOCK`) — blocks and bindings resolve at
  different TIMES.
  (d) **`workflow_plan`'s `template` arg was accepted and IGNORED** — a model passing it got a
  generic scaffold and no signal its request was dropped, which makes the library look useless.
  (e) The FE picker was the real "template picker" work: every bundled template declares a required
  input and the Run button passed none, so all six were unstartable from the UI.
  (f) No mtime bundled-SYNC was built, deliberately: serving read-only from the package means an
  upgrade ships new templates with no "did the user edit it?" reconciliation. The plan's "bundled-sync
  (mtime, no-overwrite)" is satisfied by not needing one. DEVIATION recorded.
  (g) **CI FIX amended onto #156**: Slice 9a's tests registered the bundled provider into the
  process-global `defs._providers` and never unregistered, so `test_workflows_tools.py` saw 7 defs
  where it asserts 1 — three failures visible only in a full-suite run. Both template test modules
  now snapshot-and-restore the registry. (`test_workflows_scope.py`'s failure was the same shard's
  collateral.) The 2 `test_subagent.py` timeouts in that run are the PRE-EXISTING flake.
