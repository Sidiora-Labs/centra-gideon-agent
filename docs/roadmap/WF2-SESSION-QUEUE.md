# Workflows-V2 — session execution queue

**The single source of truth for autonomous execution order.** A nudge reads this file,
finds the first session whose status is not DONE, and executes it.

This file exists because 77 sessions do not fit in one context window. Every session ends
with its status written here, so the thread survives compaction: the queue is on disk, not
in anyone's head.

## Working rules (do not renegotiate these per session)

1. **Branch from the PREVIOUS session's branch, never from `main`.** Name it
   `feature-wf2-<slug>`. The stack merges in order with no conflicts.
2. **One atomic commit per PR.** Fixes to the same PR AMEND that commit and
   `git push --force-with-lease`. Never a second commit on the same PR — with one commit a
   squash-merge produces an identical tree, which is what keeps the next rebase trivial.
3. **A PR covers 2-3 related sessions** (the group is marked below). Commit each session's
   work into the group's single commit by amending.
4. **Gate before every commit:** `make lint` + `make test` green. No exceptions.
5. **Real-model validation every session** against the tiered Bedrock bindings
   (see below). If a session produces nothing observable yet, validate the seam it exposes
   — never claim validation that did not happen.
6. **`git commit -s`**, owner identity, no agent trailers.
7. Record DONE here + deviations in the owning plan's `## Execution log`.
8. **On a blocker:** if the work can proceed correctly without it, proceed and record a
   DEVIATION. If proceeding would break architecture or force a poor implementation, mark
   BLOCKED here with the reasoning and move to the next unblocked session. Never guess at
   an architectural decision to preserve momentum.

## Model tiers (bound + verified 2026-08-01)

| Workflow `model_tier` | Use case | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | `background` | `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` |
| `standard` | `orchestration` | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` |
| `reasoning` | `reasoning` | `global.anthropic.claude-opus-5` |

Also bound: `chat`/`code_tools` → sonnet-5, `loops` → opus-5. Embeddings available via
`global.cohere.embed-v4:0`. Dev home `.dev-home-bedrock`, `AWS_PROFILE=golani`.
Bare model ids are REFUSED by Bedrock — the `global.`/`us.` inference-profile prefix is
mandatory.

## Execution log (one line per session; newest last)

- 2026-08-01 — queue created. Sessions 1-77 defined. Model tiers bound + verified
  (haiku/sonnet/opus → fast/standard/reasoning). Engine Slices 0-1 already DONE.
- 2026-08-01 — sessions 1-3 (G1, Slice 2) DONE. `resilience.py` + `verify.py`, wired into
  the controller and gate dispatcher. 10049 tests (+76). Real-model validated: mutation-hint
  retry (haiku recovered on attempt 2 with the correction in-prompt), breaker stopped a
  20-iteration thrash at 3 with zero model calls, opus-5 judge PASSed a sound claim and
  REJECTed an absurd one via the closed enum, ladder refused to average away a hard failure,
  artifact gate rejected claimed-but-absent files and refused a traversal pattern.
  DEVIATIONS: (a) `check_budget` now sets `warn` even when already over — a single large node
  can jump past the cap, and treating over as "no warning needed" left the user with a paused
  run and no notice; (b) `model_tier_standard` defaults to `orchestration` not `background`,
  or `standard` and `fast` collapse to one model and the three tiers are decorative;
  (c) added `GateKind.LADDER` + `GateKind.JUDGE` rather than overloading `verify_command`.
- 2026-08-01 — session 4 (Slice 3a, the effect ledger) DONE → **PR #139**. `effects.py`:
  `sha256(run_id+instance_path+epoch)` identity, the 5-state effect lifecycle in
  `events.jsonl`, the committed-effect redo boundary, teardown-before-redo, strict
  one-object BYOI stdout parsing, and `CallerDedupe` for the Slice-6 tool surface.
  10075 tests (+26). Validated live against the REAL bash provider: fired 1x and committed
  `output_id=res-42`; an epoch bump without `redo_effects` blocked (`committed_effect`) with
  the provider never dispatched — still 1x; with `redo_effects` the teardown received
  `res-42` and the node re-fired exactly once.
  DEVIATIONS: (a) **`BLOCKED` added to `TERMINAL_STATES`** — it means "the engine refused,
  a human must decide", so leaving it schedulable made the frontier relaunch-and-refuse
  forever (the silent hang the state exists to prevent); its absence also made
  `_ROOT_TO_RUN[BLOCKED]` unreachable. 351 workflow tests confirm no regression.
  (b) PR base is `main`, not `feature-wf2-slice2`: #138 squash-merged mid-session, so the
  branch was rebased `--onto origin/main` to shed the duplicated pre-squash slice-2 content.
  **Stacking lesson: when the predecessor PR merges mid-session, rebase onto the squashed
  main rather than opening against a deleted branch.**
  (c) **DCO landmine, cost one CI failure:** `git commit --amend -F -` REPLACES the message
  and silently drops the `Signed-off-by` trailer. Always `--amend -s`. Verify with
  `git log -1 --format='%(trailers:key=Signed-off-by,valueonly)'` before pushing.
- 2026-08-01 — session 5 (Slice 3b) DONE → **PR #140**. `scope.py` (snapshot/diff write-scope
  with symlink resolution, warn-vs-reject, opt-in), `audit.py` (`workflow_audit` diagnose/heal,
  dry-run-default, live-controller protection, `blocked{protocol_violation}`), `secrets.py`
  (`_has*` strip / node-id-keyed re-inject / inline-secret lint), and the v2 `run-workflow`
  provider re-registered + re-allowlisted in one commit. 10148 tests (+73).
  Validated live on real disk: a provider clobbering a real file above the workspace was
  caught by name in warn (complete + ledgered) and reject (scope_violation); a real symlink
  escape resolved out of scope; an 8h-stale node healed to blocked/protocol_violation while
  dry-run changed nothing.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **`_epoch` used `time.mktime` on UTC `...Z` stamps** in BOTH
  `audit.py` and `controller.py` — mktime reads the struct as LOCAL time, so the offset
  cancelled the measured age and the stale-running check was permanently inert; in the
  controller it only showed as an hour-wrong duration across a DST boundary. Both now
  `calendar.timegm`, regression-pinned. (b) **Consolidated the duplicate credential-shape
  list**: `validator.py` had its own prefix tuple, so two vendor-shape lists would drift
  until one stopped catching a provider. It now reads `secrets.py`; the stale validator
  keeps-entry was removed and `secrets.py` added, carrying over `gho_`/`hf_` (a test caught
  that the consolidation would have dropped them). (c) `watch_roots` is necessarily WIDER
  than `allowed_write_paths` — snapshotting only allowed paths makes a violation
  undetectable by construction; it reaches one level above the workspace, not `$HOME`, and
  the limitation is stated in the module rather than papered over.
- 2026-08-01 — session 6 (Slice 4a, `mutations.py`) DONE → **PR #141** (stacked on #140,
  which was still open — normal stacking, no rebase needed). Typed op vocabulary, the
  binding-dependency cascade, transactional batch (parse → validate → apply-to-copy →
  re-validate), grammar hardening a-d, spec-history writer, force-only epoch bump.
  10199 tests (+51). Validated live on a real completed 4-node run: **tree subtree of
  `gather` = ['gather'] vs BINDING closure = ['analyze','gather','report']** — a tree reset
  would have missed both consumers (the WF2-R2 stale-input bug, demonstrated rather than
  asserted); editing a done node rejected `WF_MUT_FROZEN_NODE`; a spec-breaking delete
  wrote nothing.
  NOTES: `rewind`/`run_from`/`fork` are spec-level no-ops here by design — they change
  INSTANCE STATE and run identity, which Slice 4c owns; `inline_subworkflow` is a typed
  refusal until Slice 10. Both are explicit, not silent.
- 2026-08-01 — session 7 (Slice 4b, the mutation queue) DONE → **PR #142** (stack:
  #140→#141→#142). `submit_mutation` (validate + queue + synchronous preview + confirm gate
  + `expect_version`), `_drain_mutations` at the documented safe point with the **TOCTOU
  re-verify**, rewind/run_from state reset, `store.archive_output` (attic, not delete),
  `inputs_stale` journaling, spec-history writing. 10224 tests (+25).
  Validated live: unconfirmed rewind refused with nothing queued; confirmed reset exactly
  ['analyze','report'] leaving gather/unrelated done; 2 outputs archived; re-run cost
  exactly 2 model calls; `spec_history/v002.json` + 1 journaled edit.
  DEVIATION/BUGFIX: **`_terminal` stayed set after a loop exited**, so a controller
  restarted in place after a rewind returned the PREVIOUS run's status instantly without
  waiting for the new work. `start()` now clears it. Found by the end-to-end rewind test —
  not by inspection, which is the argument for driving the real thing.
  NOTE: rollback-vs-revert is only half-landed. `rewind` (rollback: hard reset with
  preserved forward refs) is done; `revert` (inverse-patch ONE node's effects, 409 with the
  conflict named on overlapping later state) needs the checkpoint machinery from 4c to
  identify what "later state" is, so it moves to session 8. Recorded rather than faked.
- 2026-08-01 — session 8 (Slice 4c) DONE → **PR #143** (stack #140→#141→#142→#143).
  **Slice 4 is complete.** `checkpoints.py`: checkpoints (instance map + spec version, NOT
  outputs), `fork_run` (own run dir, `root_run_id` propagation, copied journal prefix +
  outputs, `fork_axis` disambiguator, SHARED_AXES surfaced), `prune_fork` (traversal-refusing),
  `revert_node`/`revert_paths` (409-style refusal with dependents NAMED). The `fork` op is
  wired through the mutation queue; the child lands in DRAFT deliberately (a fork exists to
  be edited before it runs — auto-starting would race that edit). All six plan-named
  property tests landed. 10267 tests (+43).
  Validated live: **a fork of a complete run resumed with ZERO model calls** (the cache-key
  claim proven, not asserted); parent byte-identical after fork; `root_run_id` stable across
  a fork-of-a-fork; revert of a consumed node refused with `dependents=['b']` while the leaf
  was allowed; `prune_fork('../../etc')` refused.
  NOTE: session 7's carried-over `revert` is now landed here, as planned. The remaining
  Slice-4 gap is the journal-region attic (`journal/attic/v<NNN>/`): outputs are archived and
  the in-memory cache is invalidated, but the journal FILE stays append-only by contract, so
  region archival belongs with the retention sweep rather than here. Recorded, not faked.
- 2026-08-01 — session 9 (Slice 5a, the human-input contract) DONE → **PR #144**
  (stack #140→#141→#142→#143→#144). `human_input.py`: typed Ask (4 kinds, per-field types +
  defaults + validation), continuation records with `resolved_inputs` + handoff bundle,
  ATOMIC single-use consumption via unlink, typed `resume_expired`, mode-dependent gate
  timeouts. `controller.resume()` is the out-of-band entry point for widget/inbox/HTTP/chat.
  10313 tests (+46).
  Validated live: a real run blocked with a handoff naming what had already run; an invalid
  answer was refused with the token INTACT; a **fresh controller** (standing in for a gateway
  restart between question and answer) approved it and the immediate second resume was
  refused; the run completed with `deployed=true`; an expired token returned a typed item.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **surfacing and terminating had to be split.** Giving
  background gates a default deadline meant an unanswered gate had a wake time and stopped
  reporting `needs_input` — it waited silently. `_surface_needs_input` publishes without
  ending the run, so a gate is visible NOW and can still time out later. A regression pair
  pins both, because an earlier cut broke whichever behaviour was written last.
  (b) `wait` nodes are excluded from needs-input surfacing — parked on the clock, they
  resolve themselves. (c) Rewind drops tokens PREFIX-SCOPED, not globally: dropping every
  token on any rewind would cancel approvals a rewind cannot affect. Both directions tested.
- 2026-08-01 — session 10 (Slice 5b) DONE → **PR #145** (stack #140→…→#145).
  **Slice 5 is complete.** `gate_policy.py`: risk-scoped auto-approve (reusing
  `tool_providers.RiskLevel`, NOT a new vocabulary), owner binding + default-DENY for remote
  channels, `AllowMemory` (run-scoped, cleared on rewind), event-gate transient hold with
  event preservation + bounded give-up, and `clarification_from_output` so ANY action node
  can ask without a pre-placed gate. 10360 tests (+47).
  Validated live: schedule-fired runs sailed through safe/caution and STOPPED at destructive
  AND undeclared; an intruder's channel reply was refused with the token surviving for the
  real owner; rewind cleared the remembered allow; an absent prerequisite held with
  `preserve_event=True` while an invalid payload gave up; remote timeout denied.
  KEY DECISION: **an undeclared gate defaults to DESTRUCTIVE.** Deny-by-default toward
  higher risk means forgetting to classify a gate makes it ASK; the opposite default would
  turn every unclassified gate in an unattended run into an unreviewed action.
- 2026-08-01 — session 11 (Slice 6a, the chat tool surface) DONE → **PR #147**
  (stack #141→…→#147). `workflows/service.py` (the ONE implementation Slice 7a's REST routes
  will also call), `mcp_workflows.py` (19 tools, coded never-raising results),
  `MCP_WORKFLOW_SCHEMAS` in validation.py, all 19 `manifest_meta` entries. All FOUR
  registration points wired incl. the regenerated offline reference. 10424 tests (+63).
  Validated live end to end: manifest generated from the engine's enums; plan → dry-run
  author (nothing written) → save → list; a `ghp_` literal REFUSED; a blocking run through
  the real engine completed with correct output; fork named its 3 shared axes; 4 error paths
  coded and readable; audit defaulted to dry-run.
  DEVIATIONS/DISCOVERIES: (a) **`_run` used bare `asyncio.run`**, which raises "cannot be
  called from a running event loop" when the caller is async. Production is safe (the native
  runtime uses a thread executor) but a surface contracted to never raise must not depend on
  its caller — it now detects a running loop and completes on a worker thread. FOUND BY
  DRIVING IT FROM AN ASYNC SCRIPT, not by a unit test (which called it from sync context and
  never hit it). Pinned by an async-context test.
  (b) `error_codes` in manifest_meta stay EMPTY: that registry is the `ERR_`-prefixed
  AgentError ENVELOPE, a different channel from these `WF_*` result-body codes. Declaring
  them there would put one failure in two vocabularies (the drift test enforces the
  registry, which is append-only).
  (c) Two Phase-1 assertions that `mcp_workflows` is ABSENT were correct then, obsolete now.
  Retargeted to the surviving invariant: `prompt_render` does not live there and every tool
  is `workflow_`-prefixed.
  (d) This category does NOT go over HTTP like its siblings — the engine is in-process, and
  a gateway round-trip to reach an object in the same process buys nothing.
