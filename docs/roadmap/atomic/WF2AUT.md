# WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE`](../plans/WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE.md)  
**Code:** `WF2AUT`  
**Source status:** in_progress



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |

**Status:** done (PR ##250-#543)

§7 steps 7 & 9 (partial); §5 FE (triggers list, runs inbox, templates); §5.2 durable approval objects (AUTO-R13); §1.4 decision 13 delivery contract (AUTO-R18); AUTO-A3 Week grid; §4.1 doctor; §7 step 9 snapshot/portability

### `WF2AUT-6` — Wire the view kind's on_render runtime to a production render surface

**Status:** todo

Status REMAINING; §1.2 view kind; §7 step 8; triggers/pull_on_view.py; AUTO-R10

**Done when:** a real dashboard-tile/artifact render calls on_render(trigger,now) so a view trigger past its TTL actually refreshes (currently zero production callers); TTL-serve-cache verified; the gateway-must-not-import-as-loop test still holds

### `WF2AUT-7` — web_watch headless-Chromium escalation tier + knowledge-store digest routing

**Status:** todo

Status REMAINING (NEWLY STARTABLE via web/render.py js-render extra); §1.2 web_watch; §3 escalating-fetch-with-budget; Plug-in Map egress; S121 DEVIATIONs

**Done when:** web_poll escalates plain net.fetch -> egress-guarded headless tier under one max_requests budget with ledger-logged escalations; digest output lands in the knowledge store (user items), not memory; web_poll.py stale no-browser-runtime docstring corrected

### `WF2AUT-8` — trigger_source provider seam (AUTO-A4): PROVIDER_TYPES + handler, manifest declaration, namespaced app:<name>:<event> bus sources

**Status:** todo

Amendment round-2 AUTO-A4; §7 step 8; Plug-in Map (#47 rule); apps/manifest.py, providers/registry.py, event-bus ingestion, sdk/ facade

**Done when:** a fixture app's declared trigger_source fires an event trigger end-to-end with fenced+provenanced payload and frozen capabilities honored; disabling the app parks its bound triggers with a typed reason; test_manifest_types_match_handlers green; core contains no vendor names

### `WF2AUT-9` — §3.5 skip_if_active liveness guard + acting_on resource claim on mutating triggers

**Status:** todo

Status REMAINING (undeclared anywhere today); §3.5 foreground-yield/resource-slots; AUTO-R9

**Done when:** skip_if_active declared on the Trigger entity and evaluated at fire time via cheap liveness heuristics (dirty worktree/lockfiles/recent mtime); acting_on resource claim serializes two trigger-fired runs targeting the same resource; a busy target yields a typed deferred ledger row

### `WF2AUT-10` — §5 did/suppressed fold affordance FE consumer

**Status:** todo

Status REMAINING (no FE consumer); §5.2 runs inbox (no-op/suppressed rows auto-archived out of default view); §1.3 archive split (backend shipped S165)

**Done when:** the Automations runs-inbox surfaces the did-vs-suppressed fold control so archived/inert rows can be revealed on demand; backend archive split already present, this wires the FE toggle

### `WF2AUT-11` — idle kind runtime for user automations + autonudge.py deletion (loop-ticker absorption)

**Status:** todo

§2 autonudge.py ABSORBED as kind:idle (LAST); §7 step 9; §1.2 idle kind; Risks (Loops coupling)

**Done when:** kind:idle fires for user automations preserving reactive re-arm/delivered-only counting/mid-turn-drop; autonudge.py deleted and the loop tick engine rides kind:idle (this half only after LOOPS-EVOLUTION Phase 4)

**Status:** todo

Status REMAINING BLOCKED (E4 owner decision); §1.2 webhook kind; §1.4 decision 12 scoped tokens; §7 step 6; S119/S123

**Done when:** owner clears E4 and the inbound surface owner is decided; POST /api/triggers/{id}/fire verifies the SHA-256-hashed scoped bearer token and fences the payload; token_ref lint (shipped S119) then has a fire path to guard
