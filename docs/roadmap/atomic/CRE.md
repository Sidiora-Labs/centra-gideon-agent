# CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING`](../plans/CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING.md)  
**Code:** `CRE`  
**Source status:** done

CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING is fully shipped: committed flake8 standard + whole-tree reformat (mypy 152→0), core ci.yml (lint/test/web/rails) + full.yml matrix, apps-repo ci.yml, release.yml (build/pypi/pypi-client/images/notes/attest via Trusted Publishing), uv.lock + Dependabot + SBOM + coverage badge, and a test-isolation root-cause pass that fixed 4 real product bugs the gate surfaced. Only owner real-world confirmations (GHCR packages→public on first push, optional main branch protection) remain — no agent-executable code left.

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

### `CRE-6` — Test-isolation root-cause + first-CI environment fixes (S1 amendment)

**Status:** done

Execution log — S1 amendment (isolation root-caused, mitigations retired); first/second/third-CI passes; PR wall-time budget

**Done when:** four isolation root causes fixed in-code with no reruns (conftest._reset_sel_singleton, _isolate_single_flight_locks, _tmp_home ordering, frozen_clock fixture); pytest-rerunfailures + global GIDEON_HOME rail removed from all pytest jobs; two real product bugs the runner surfaced fixed at source (sandbox.py _probe_unshare sequential two-step; BackendSupervisor ps -Awwo unlimited width); full suite deterministically green (7665 passed / 13 xfailed) with no flakes
