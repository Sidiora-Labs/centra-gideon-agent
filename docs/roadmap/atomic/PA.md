# PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT`](../plans/PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT.md)  
**Code:** `PA`  
**Source status:** proposed

6 atoms, all todo. Triage flagship = PA-1 (approval memory + config foundation, independently landable) → PA-2 (5-stage digest pipeline) → PA-3 (inbox-op action provider + budgeted auto-execution) → PA-5 (triage FE + validation). Decision journal = PA-4 (native type + tools + horizon triggers + R18 lesson) → PA-6 (journal view + calibration FE). Cross-plan deps (substrate/guardrails/flywheel/inbox-notif) are already DONE/shipped enough to unblock, but recorded as EXT edges.

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PA-1` | ⬜ | Approval memory + ProactiveConfig foundation (Session 1) | — | `user.approval.` prefix resolves to an `approval` MemoryKind in `_kind_from_key` and is excluded from `_NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE`; deterministic most-specific/deny-wins rule matcher, reply-grammar parser, and 24h/7d/30d suppression cooldowns are unit-tested pure functions; `ProactiveConfig` round-trips through the 5-point wiring (test_config_roundtrip green); `triage_rules` tool lists/adds/revokes rules with provenance |
| `PA-2` | ⬜ | Triage pipeline: collect → classifier gate → tiered strict-JSON proposals → rank → deliver + Morning-triage template (Session 2) | `PA-1`, `EXT:WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE:Run Ledger materiality rows (AUTO-R2) + delivery contract + fire→spawn classifier machinery`, `EXT:AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS:NEW-2 typed structured-output (output_type) for the proposal schema`, `EXT:INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION:notify gate + notification-kind registry the digest delivers through` | Firing the bundled "Morning triage" WorkflowDef collects inbox + channel + Run-Ledger items into a stable ordinal manifest, the classifier gate drops/surfaces per per-source NL rules (zero-item windows short-circuit before LLM spend), ONE strict-JSON call emits ≤8 tier-clamped proposals honoring the exact-ordinal-id contract, and a materiality-ranked digest is delivered through the notify gate as one normal WorkflowRun |
| `PA-3` | ⬜ | Trivial-tier auto-execution + `inbox-op` action provider (Session 3) | `PA-2`, `EXT:AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS:NEW-1 budget floor (per-run/day token+dollar+action ceilings) consulted before each auto-executed action` | `inbox-op` implements ActionProvider, is registered via register_action_provider, added to ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS, and carries a settings-schema manifest; trivial/always-approve proposals auto-execute bounded by the NEW-1 budget floor + max_auto_actions_per_run cap, each emitting a named-rule ledger row with one-click undo, and budget breach demotes remaining proposals to pending with skipped_budget rows; adversarial injection test (criterion 2) passes |
| `PA-4` | ⬜ | Decision journal core: `decision` native type + tools + horizon triggers + R18 lesson (Session 4) | `EXT:WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE:one-shot clock/at trigger with delete_after_run (commitment-conversion pattern)`, `EXT:WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL:LEARN-R18 pending→resolved lesson lifecycle (write_lesson)` | `decision` is the 13th NATIVE_TYPES entry riding the Passthrough graph; log_decision/decision_list/decision_resolve tools exist; log_decision creates a searchable/@-pickable knowledge item and mints exactly one one-shot clock trigger with a deterministic `system:decision-journal:<id>`; the decision-review WorkflowDef captures the outcome, sets status=resolved, and writes a `lesson.*` memory row via write_lesson citing expectation-vs-outcome, linked only by soft reference (criterion 5) |
| `PA-5` | ⬜ | Triage FE surfaces + as-a-user validation (Session 5a) | `PA-2`, `PA-3` | Digest card renders auto-done+undo, pending proposals with tier badges and one-tap yes/no/always, and the ledger "what your machine did" section with permalinks; the rules-manager settings card shows/revokes rules with the send-capable graduation toggle; the Morning-triage template pack card installs an editable trigger; triage flow validated as-a-user incl. quiet-hours deferral, gateway-restart reply idempotency, and rule revocation (criteria 1/3/4/9/10) |
| `PA-6` | ⬜ | Decision Journal view + calibration strip FE + validation (Session 5b) | `PA-4` | The filtered knowledge Decision-Journal view shows pending (horizon countdown + overdue flag), resolved (expectation-vs-outcome side-by-side + linked lesson chip), and a per-domain calibration strip computed from knowledge.db alone (count-caveat under n=10, no LLM/new store); too_early defers at most twice then shows stale-pending; grep-audit confirms neither store writes the other (criteria 5/6/7/8) |

## Atom scopes

### `PA-1` — Approval memory + ProactiveConfig foundation (Session 1)

**Status:** todo

§1.4 Approval memory; Provider & Config Plug-in Map (`approval` MemoryKind, ProactiveConfig); §4 tools (triage_rules); Implementation Effort Session 1

**Done when:** `user.approval.` prefix resolves to an `approval` MemoryKind in `_kind_from_key` and is excluded from `_NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE`; deterministic most-specific/deny-wins rule matcher, reply-grammar parser, and 24h/7d/30d suppression cooldowns are unit-tested pure functions; `ProactiveConfig` round-trips through the 5-point wiring (test_config_roundtrip green); `triage_rules` tool lists/adds/revokes rules with provenance

### `PA-2` — Triage pipeline: collect → classifier gate → tiered strict-JSON proposals → rank → deliver + Morning-triage template (Session 2)

**Status:** todo

§1.1 Collect; §1.2 Classifier gate; §1.3 Tiered strict-JSON proposals; §1.5 Rank + deliver; template pack (§1 intro / §5.4)

**Done when:** Firing the bundled "Morning triage" WorkflowDef collects inbox + channel + Run-Ledger items into a stable ordinal manifest, the classifier gate drops/surfaces per per-source NL rules (zero-item windows short-circuit before LLM spend), ONE strict-JSON call emits ≤8 tier-clamped proposals honoring the exact-ordinal-id contract, and a materiality-ranked digest is delivered through the notify gate as one normal WorkflowRun

### `PA-3` — Trivial-tier auto-execution + `inbox-op` action provider (Session 3)

**Status:** todo

§1.6 Trivial-tier auto-execution — guardrails; `inbox-op` provider (§1.6 + Plug-in Map); Success Criteria 2/3/4

**Done when:** `inbox-op` implements ActionProvider, is registered via register_action_provider, added to ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS, and carries a settings-schema manifest; trivial/always-approve proposals auto-execute bounded by the NEW-1 budget floor + max_auto_actions_per_run cap, each emitting a named-rule ledger row with one-click undo, and budget breach demotes remaining proposals to pending with skipped_budget rows; adversarial injection test (criterion 2) passes

### `PA-4` — Decision journal core: `decision` native type + tools + horizon triggers + R18 lesson (Session 4)

**Status:** todo

§2.1 Data model; §2.2 log_decision; §2.3 Horizon-triggered review + outcome capture; §2.4 Lesson distillation via LEARN-R18; §4 tools

**Done when:** `decision` is the 13th NATIVE_TYPES entry riding the Passthrough graph; log_decision/decision_list/decision_resolve tools exist; log_decision creates a searchable/@-pickable knowledge item and mints exactly one one-shot clock trigger with a deterministic `system:decision-journal:<id>`; the decision-review WorkflowDef captures the outcome, sets status=resolved, and writes a `lesson.*` memory row via write_lesson citing expectation-vs-outcome, linked only by soft reference (criterion 5)

### `PA-5` — Triage FE surfaces + as-a-user validation (Session 5a)

**Status:** todo

§5.1 Digest card; §5.2 Triage rules manager; §5.4 Template pack card; Success Criteria 1/3/4/9/10

**Done when:** Digest card renders auto-done+undo, pending proposals with tier badges and one-tap yes/no/always, and the ledger "what your machine did" section with permalinks; the rules-manager settings card shows/revokes rules with the send-capable graduation toggle; the Morning-triage template pack card installs an editable trigger; triage flow validated as-a-user incl. quiet-hours deferral, gateway-restart reply idempotency, and rule revocation (criteria 1/3/4/9/10)

### `PA-6` — Decision Journal view + calibration strip FE + validation (Session 5b)

**Status:** todo

§2.5 Calibration record; §5.3 Decision Journal view; Success Criteria 5/6/7/8

**Done when:** The filtered knowledge Decision-Journal view shows pending (horizon countdown + overdue flag), resolved (expectation-vs-outcome side-by-side + linked lesson chip), and a per-domain calibration strip computed from knowledge.db alone (count-caveat under n=10, no LLM/new store); too_early defers at most twice then shows stale-pending; grep-audit confirms neither store writes the other (criteria 5/6/7/8)
