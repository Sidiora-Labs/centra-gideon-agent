# PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY`](../plans/PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY.md)  
**Code:** `PL`  
**Source status:** done



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.
