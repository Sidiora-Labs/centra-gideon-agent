# MULTIMODAL-IO — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`MULTIMODAL-IO`](../plans/MULTIMODAL-IO.md)  
**Code:** `MI`  
**Source status:** proposed

5 atoms along the plan's own session seams. MI-1 (entity+resolver), MI-3 (duplex), MI-4 (screen-context) are independent and buildable now. MI-2 (cloning engine) carries the sole cross-plan edge on LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2. MI-5 is the UI + full-matrix validation capstone depending on MI-1..MI-4. Nothing done; all TODO.

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MI-1` | ⬜ | voice_profiles entity store + resolver (CRUD, lock-from-history, consent-as-provenance, per-surface bindings + 4-level precedence) | — | voice_profiles CRUD + typed WS events + resumable ref-audio upload (target: voice_profile) + symlink-contained ids work; lock/unlock pins seed + locked.wav from bounded history; consent record/verify/revoke SEL-audited with verified_own_voice recomputed from artifacts (hand-edited JSON flag alone does NOT flip it); active_voice_params(surface=) walks the 4-level chain returning the superset dict; deleting all profiles reproduces today's flat piper output (zero-profile regression test green) |
| `MI-2` | ⬜ | Cloning-capable TTS engine app beside piper + capability flags (supports_cloning/supports_voice_design) + typed refusal | `MI-1`, `EXT:LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2:sidecar runner + CapabilityMatrix + catalog.json + real-inference selftest on main` | OmniVoice-vs-CosyVoice spike run on fixtures with the loser's notes in the plan dir; apps/voice-clone-tts ships as a sidecar LocalTtsProvider app with catalog.json cards (runtime torch, matrix flags), declaring supports_cloning; CapabilityMatrix + TtsProvider gain supports_cloning/supports_voice_design plus defaulted ref_audio/ref_text/seed/instruct/design_params kwargs (piper/OpenAI compile unchanged); a clone-kind profile bound to a non-cloning provider returns 409 cloning_unsupported:<provider>; LMM-V2 selftest synthesizes through a clone reference fixture; killing the sidecar mid-synthesis leaves the gateway up with a typed crash reason |
| `MI-3` | ⬜ | Duplex-loop hardening pack (confirmation gating, echo filter + STT mute, pre-TTS cleaning, voice disclaimer, VoiceConfig) | — | voice/duplex.py pure functions (is_confirmation/is_exit/is_echo 3-consecutive-word/clean_for_speech) with unit suite; FE hands-free transcript accumulation + mute-during-playback hook draining mic buffers; api_voice_synthesize records last-TTS-text and cleans after redact calls; api_stt_transcribe consults echo on duplex:true returning {text:'',filtered:'echo'}; voice turns carry the disclaimer + input_origin:voice in session JSONL; VoiceConfig six fields round-trip through dataclass/_meta, load(), to_dict(), _EDITABLE_CONFIG PATCH + VoicePanel.tsx controls |

## Atom scopes

### `MI-1` — voice_profiles entity store + resolver (CRUD, lock-from-history, consent-as-provenance, per-surface bindings + 4-level precedence)

**Status:** todo

§1 The voice_profiles Entity (§1.1 schema/per-entity JSON store + path containment + ref-audio upload target; §1.2 lock-from-history; §1.3 consent-as-provenance, SEL-audited); §3 Per-Surface Voice Bindings (voice_bindings.json + explicit>binding>default>built-in precedence in active_voice_params(surface=)); §6 zero-profile migration fallback

**Done when:** voice_profiles CRUD + typed WS events + resumable ref-audio upload (target: voice_profile) + symlink-contained ids work; lock/unlock pins seed + locked.wav from bounded history; consent record/verify/revoke SEL-audited with verified_own_voice recomputed from artifacts (hand-edited JSON flag alone does NOT flip it); active_voice_params(surface=) walks the 4-level chain returning the superset dict; deleting all profiles reproduces today's flat piper output (zero-profile regression test green)

### `MI-2` — Cloning-capable TTS engine app beside piper + capability flags (supports_cloning/supports_voice_design) + typed refusal

**Status:** todo

§2 Provider Capability Flags + a Cloning Engine Beside Piper (§2.1 CapabilityMatrix + TtsProvider flags & defaulted synthesize kwargs; §2.2 apps/voice-clone-tts sidecar model app from OmniVoice-vs-CosyVoice spike; §2.3 no new provider type / no hook-action creep)

**Done when:** OmniVoice-vs-CosyVoice spike run on fixtures with the loser's notes in the plan dir; apps/voice-clone-tts ships as a sidecar LocalTtsProvider app with catalog.json cards (runtime torch, matrix flags), declaring supports_cloning; CapabilityMatrix + TtsProvider gain supports_cloning/supports_voice_design plus defaulted ref_audio/ref_text/seed/instruct/design_params kwargs (piper/OpenAI compile unchanged); a clone-kind profile bound to a non-cloning provider returns 409 cloning_unsupported:<provider>; LMM-V2 selftest synthesizes through a clone reference fixture; killing the sidecar mid-synthesis leaves the gateway up with a typed crash reason

### `MI-3` — Duplex-loop hardening pack (confirmation gating, echo filter + STT mute, pre-TTS cleaning, voice disclaimer, VoiceConfig)

**Status:** todo

§4 Duplex-Loop Hardening Pack (§4.1 confirmation-phrase gating; §4.2 TTS-echo filter + mute-during-playback; §4.3 clean_for_speech after existing redaction; §4.4 voice-origin disclaimer + input_origin metadata; §4.5 VoiceConfig via the four wiring points)

**Done when:** voice/duplex.py pure functions (is_confirmation/is_exit/is_echo 3-consecutive-word/clean_for_speech) with unit suite; FE hands-free transcript accumulation + mute-during-playback hook draining mic buffers; api_voice_synthesize records last-TTS-text and cleans after redact calls; api_stt_transcribe consults echo on duplex:true returning {text:'',filtered:'echo'}; voice turns carry the disclaimer + input_origin:voice in session JSONL; VoiceConfig six fields round-trip through dataclass/_meta, load(), to_dict(), _EDITABLE_CONFIG PATCH + VoicePanel.tsx controls

### `MI-4` — Screen-context observation channel — opt-in ephemeral screen share into interactive chat (§5 live-session remainder only)

**Status:** todo

§5 Screen-Context Observation Channel (§5.2 FE getDisplayMedia capture + in-app banner chip, frame-on-send; §5.3 POST /api/chat/screen-frame in-memory slot + injection beside _inject_attachment_content with vision-native vs fenced-described routing; §5.4 ephemerality + pin-to-uploads + incognito guard; §5.5 dashboard.screen_share_enabled config + SEL share start/stop)

**Done when:** composer screen-share toggle gated by dashboard.screen_share_enabled (OFF by default) with in-app pulsing chip + browser indicator both showing; POST /api/chat/screen-frame stages a latest-wins in-memory per-session frame; chat runner drains it as an image part for vision models, else one-shot describe → fence_untrusted(source='screen-share') with turn annotated screen_context:described, toggle disabled with reason when no vision binding resolves; Pin writes through the uploads store (suppressed in incognito); test asserts zero image bytes anywhere under ~/.gideon after a share turn; screen_share_enabled round-trips through all four wiring points + Settings toggle

### `MI-5` — Voice bindings + profile-manager UI, one-click migration, and full-matrix as-a-user validation sweep

**Status:** todo

Implementation Effort Session 5 (Settings → Voice bindings table [surface × profile picker] + profile manager UI for create/clone/design/lock/consent flows; §6 one-click 'create a profile from my current voice' migration, never automatic; deep-mutation full-matrix validation); Success Criterion 10 provider-family byte-identical assertion

**Done when:** Settings → Voice shows a bindings table and profile manager driving MI-1 CRUD + MI-2 engine end-to-end from the UI; one-click migration synthesizes a design-kind profile from the active tts binding and sets it default (only on explicit action); full-matrix as-a-user validation passes across profile CRUD × lock × both engines × per-surface bindings × duplex behaviors × screen share on vision and non-vision models; ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS, PROVIDER_TYPES, and the type-handler set assert byte-identical before/after
