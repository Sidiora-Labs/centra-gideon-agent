# DISTRIBUTION — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`DISTRIBUTION`](../plans/DISTRIBUTION.md)  
**Code:** `DIST`  
**Source status:** done

DISTRIBUTION is DONE for all code deliverables (S1–S4). 12 atoms: 9 done (packaging correctness, SDK demotion core+apps halves, sdist SPA fix, client packaging, docs restructure, bootstrap install.sh, containers, self-update generalization) plus the first PyPI publish (PyPI carries core+client through 0.1.3). Remaining todo: owner clean-VM walkthroughs V1–V4 and the out-of-scope S5 Homebrew/Nix channels. The one intra-plan gate that mattered — the class-B update_kind_aware gate — was re-scoped to a clean break because LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE is deferred (no lifecycle/ package). Key cross-plan edges: CI-RELEASE owns the build pipeline that produces every artifact these paths install; T1.4's SDK demotion was contingent on PROVIDER-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION S2's app pip-step (confirmed supported); DISCOVERABILITY hosts /install.

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DIST-1` | ✅ (#6b0104e, eb5f0c4) | Packaging correctness: [project.urls], single-sourced __version__, drop zip-safe, verify_wheel contract (C3/C4) | `EXT:CI-RELEASE:release.yml must run npm build before python -m build and host the verify_wheel step (T3.1)` | pip show lists all 5 Project-URLs; test_version_consistency goes red when pyproject/__version__/CHANGELOG-latest disagree; scripts/verify_wheel.py exits 0 — SPA present in wheel, installs Node-free into a scratch venv, boots gateway --test-mode, / and /api/healthz return 200; wired into release.yml |
| `DIST-2` | ✅ (#71db09f) | Demote openai/anthropic to extras + require_sdk lazy-import errors (core-repo half of T1.4) | `EXT:PROVIDER-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION:S2 app pip-step (app_manager._install_python_deps) must install app-declared pythonDependencies — confirmed DONE before this proceeded (else DEVIATION/skip)` | clean install without extras: wheel METADATA carries openai/anthropic ONLY as `extra ==` entries; missing-SDK error text names the exact `pip install 'gideon[openai]'` remedy + doctor hint at the 4 lazy-import sites; test_sdk_deps green |
