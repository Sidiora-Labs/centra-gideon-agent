# DISTRIBUTION — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`DISTRIBUTION`](../plans/DISTRIBUTION.md)  
**Code:** `DIST`  
**Source status:** done

DISTRIBUTION is DONE for all code deliverables (S1–S4). 13 atoms: 9 done (packaging correctness, SDK demotion core+apps halves, sdist SPA fix, client packaging, docs restructure, bootstrap install.sh, containers, self-update generalization) plus the first PyPI publish (PyPI carries core+client through 0.1.3) and `DIST-13`, which routed `gideon update` through that per-kind updater — S4 had replaced the git-only path on the dashboard side only, so every pip/pipx/uv-tool user's `update` still dead-ended on a missing source tree. Remaining todo: owner clean-VM walkthroughs V1–V4 and the out-of-scope S5 Homebrew/Nix channels. The one intra-plan gate that mattered — the class-B update_kind_aware gate — was re-scoped to a plain clean break under the pre-1.0 banner (the migration-backed gate regime is deferred; no lifecycle/ package). Key cross-plan edges: CI-RELEASE owns the build pipeline that produces every artifact these paths install; T1.4's SDK demotion was contingent on PROVIDER-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION S2's app pip-step (confirmed supported); DISCOVERABILITY hosts /install.

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

#### Design

**1. The defect: S4 replaced the git-only path on one side only.** `DIST-9`'s execution log records
that the per-kind behaviour "replaced, not gated" the git-only updater. The dashboard side did.
`cli.py:592` registers `update`, `cli.py:944` dispatches to `cli_server._update`, and that function
was still: require `$GIDEON_PROJECT_DIR`, require a `.git` dir, `git fetch` + `git reset
--hard` + rebuild. `grep -rn "updates_kind\|detect_install_kind" src/gideon/cli*.py` returned
nothing. So for the two installs README.md:165-166 and `docs/guides/getting-started.md`:31-32
document FIRST — `pipx install gideon`, `pip install gideon` — `gideon update`
printed **"❌ GIDEON_PROJECT_DIR not set — cannot locate source tree"** and exited 1. A dead
end, with the correct code one module away.

**2. Why the layering caused it, and why the fix is a move rather than an import.** The taxonomy
shipped as `dashboard/handlers/updates_kind.py`, so the only way to reach `detect_install_kind()`
was to import an HTTP handler. The CLI reasonably declined, and kept its own path — which is how a
decision layer with one reachable consumer drifts. Adding a CLI→handler import would have preserved
the smell and invited the next such import. The decision + the shared primitives move to core
`gideon/self_update.py`; the dashboard handler and the CLI both become callers, and
`updates_kind.py` is deleted outright — no re-export, no shim, every call site moved in the same
commit (clean break under the pre-1.0 banner).

**3. What moves, and what deliberately does not.** Moved: `detect_install_kind` / `InstallKind` /
`INSTALL_KINDS`, the release probe + cache (`fetch_latest_release`, `build_update_status`,
`normalize_version`, `version_tuple`, `read_release_cache`), `package_root`,
`commits_behind_upstream`, `installer_error_summary`, `container_instructions`, `upgrade_spec`, and
new sync git primitives. Left in the handler: the 409 in-flight guard, `push_update_progress`
publishing, `_graceful_reexec`, `_live_auth_mode`, redaction, and the legacy changelog-diff check —
all HTTP/async concerns. **Rejected: one shared `apply(kind, progress=…)`.** The two lifecycles
genuinely differ — the dashboard applies asynchronously, streams progress and re-execs the live
gateway; the CLI is a short-lived synchronous process that prints, prompts a TTY, and has no server
to re-exec — so a single apply would be a callback-shaped abstraction over two different lifecycles.
The shared part is the *decision* plus the primitives, and that is what moved.

**4. The CLI dispatch is closed, with no default arm.** git keeps today's pipeline and now honours
`dashboard.update_dev_mode` exactly as the dashboard's apply does (OFF = ride release tags, so being
on the latest tag is "up to date" even when `main` is ahead; ON = track every commit). pip/pipx/uv-
tool run the resolved installer with `-U gideon==<latest>` and require no source tree; there
is no re-exec, because this process is the CLI and not the gateway, so it prints
`gideon restart` rather than bouncing a server nobody asked it to touch. container and desktop
print instructions. An **unmapped** kind names what it detected and exits 1 — there is no `else`
that falls through to `git reset --hard`, which on a tree that kind may not even own is the worst
available guess. `INSTALL_KINDS` (derived from the `Literal`) plus a set-equality test against the
CLI's handled set is the ratchet: a new member reds the dispatch test instead of landing in an
else-branch.

**5. Two exit-code decisions, made rather than left ambiguous.** container/desktop exit **0**: the
status answers "did the command do its job?", not "did bytes change?" — the git branch has always
exited 0 on "Already up to date", so 0 never meant "something changed" here, and for these kinds the
job IS delegation. A correctly configured container install is not a failure, and an unattended
caller cannot act on printed instructions anyway, so non-zero would add noise exactly where it
cannot help. The counter-argument (a script running `gideon update && restart` learns nothing)
is real, so the printed text is unambiguous about who must act, and a script that needs the
distinction reads `apply_method` from `GET /api/update/check`. Second: a **non-interactive stdin**
does NOT prompt and exits **1**. `input()` on a pipe either reads a piped "y" — destroying
uncommitted work nobody agreed to lose — or raises EOFError into a traceback. Refusing is
recoverable (stash or commit, re-run); a wrong yes is not. An interactive "n" still exits 0, because
declining is a choice, whereas a refusal on someone's behalf means the update they asked for did not
happen.

**6. `mainline` was never a branch here.** `cli_server` defaulted `branch = "mainline"` when
`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` came back empty or `HEAD` (detached), so a detached-HEAD update
fetched a ref this repository has never carried. `resolve_default_branch` answers honestly instead:
the checked-out branch (updating means advancing the branch you are on), else the remote's own HEAD
read from the LOCAL `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (offline-safe), else `git remote show origin`'s
`HEAD branch:` (network, so last among the probes, and `(unknown)` is not a branch name), else the
literal `main` — the repo's real default. `gateway._auto_apply_update` already coerced to `main`, so
the CLI was the sole holdout. A test asserts the old literal appears in no updater module, including
in prose a later edit could copy back into code.

**7. Nothing ships inert.** Every branch is driven: the four kinds, the unmapped-kind refusal, the
dispatch-exhaustiveness ratchet, up-to-date, dev-mode-off-on-latest-tag, fetch failure, the
confirmation confirmed / declined / EOF'd / refused-without-a-TTY, the pip pin, the unpinned offline
upgrade, the installer-error summary, and NoInstallerError. Faking is at exactly two seams —
`self_update._run_git` (every sync git spawn funnels through it) and `cli_server.subprocess.run` —
so no test can reach a real `git reset --hard` or `pip -U`.

#### Implementation plan

1. **Verify the premise before writing anything**: `grep -rn "updates_kind\|detect_install_kind"
   src/gideon/cli*.py` must return nothing, and `cli_server._update` must still require a
   `.git` dir. If the CLI already routes per kind, stop — the premise moved.
2. **Create `src/gideon/self_update.py`** with the moved decision + probe + primitive surface,
   plus `resolve_default_branch`, `container_instructions`, `upgrade_spec`, and the single `_run_git`
   seam (timeout → rc 124, missing binary → rc 127; a timeout is an ordinary updater failure, not an
   exception every caller must wrap).
3. **Delete `updates_kind.py`** and move every call site in the same commit: the five handler
   imports, `gateway._auto_apply_update`'s `_package_root`, the `handlers/__init__` re-export of the
   duplicate `_version_tuple`. Prove none was left behind by grepping every moved symbol name across
   `src/`, `tests/`, and `web/src`.
4. **Rewrite `cli_server._update`** as the closed dispatch plus one function per kind, with the
   installer and the `setup --agent-only` re-run behind small shared helpers.
5. **Re-key the spawn-ceiling census** (`tests/test_spawn_ceiling_audit.py`) for the moved and new
   spawn sites — a stale allowlist entry reds the audit in both directions, which is the point.
6. **Tests**: a new `tests/test_cli_update_kinds.py` driving every branch; branch-resolution and
   `_run_git` failure-shape tests plus the `mainline` regression rail in `tests/test_self_update.py`
   (renamed from `test_updates_kind.py`); realign — never weaken — the four existing update test
   modules to the new seam.
7. **Gate**: `make lint`; the update/install-kind/cli selections; the ratchets a new `src/` module
   and a renamed test module trip (`test_inert_surface_baseline`, `test_agent_reference`,
   `test_docs_lint_baseline`, `test_config_roundtrip`); then the full suite once, and report the
   real-home rail verdict.

**Scope guard — what this atom is NOT.** It does not add a fifth `InstallKind`: `pip` already covers
pip, pipx and uv-tool because the apply is identical for all three, and `_installer.install_argv`
already resolves which program performs it. It does not touch the dashboard's HTTP behaviour, the
C2 wire shape, or the frontend. It does not make the CLI re-exec or auto-restart a running gateway.
