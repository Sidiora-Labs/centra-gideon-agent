# EXECUTION-ISOLATION — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`EXECUTION-ISOLATION`](../plans/EXECUTION-ISOLATION.md)  
**Code:** `EI`  
**Source status:** proposed



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EI-1` | ⬜ | SandboxProvider seam + `none` provider + ResourceCeilings foundation | — | sandbox_providers/ package + `none` provider composing sandbox.wrap_argv exists; SubagentManager.spawn(sandbox="none") runs the worker through handle.exec; a child `ulimit -n` reports the ceiling; sandbox.nofile/max_pids/max_rss_mb round-trip via test_config_roundtrip; test_manifest_types_match_handlers passes (type+handler in one commit) |
| `EI-2` | ⬜ | `docker` provider + engine/workspace-block adoption + cgroup v2 tier | `EI-1`, `EXT:WORK-CONTAINERS:WORK-R3 workspace block call sites + WORK-R20 mode:container re-expression` | SC1: a stage `sandbox: docker` runs its process tree in a UID-aligned bind-mount container over its WORK-R3 worktree; a write outside allowed_write_paths is blocked by the boundary; a no-Docker machine parks needs-input with a typed reason (no silent host downgrade for unattended). SC2: a subagent `sandbox: docker` without a grant to ~/.gideon/models cannot delete a real local model. Linux fork-bomb child hits pids.max; macOS logs a one-time not-enforced warning |
| `EI-3` | ⬜ | Spawn-audit CI test + wrap remaining agent-influenced spawn seams | `EI-1` | tests/test_spawn_ceiling_audit.py is green with every agent-influenced seam ceiling-wrapped or explicitly operator-exempt; adding an unmapped create_subprocess_exec/Popen/StdioServerParameters on a branch fails CI naming the file:line |
| `EI-4` | ⬜ | Lima VM tier app + apps-sandbox (#71) + terminal sandbox picker | `EI-1`, `EI-2` | SC3: with apps/lima-sandbox installed + instance running, a terminal opened "inside the run's sandbox" executes in the VM with correct path translation; stopping the instance flips the provider to greyed-out-with-reason within one probe TTL; an interactive request gets the path-guard-only dialog; app backends launch through backend.sandbox |
| `EI-5` | ⬜ | BYO runner data catalog + Gemini CLI runner + adapter pin/verify + Settings→Agents evidence | — | SC4: Settings→Agents shows Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kiro rows with health evidence (last handshake, version, latency) + capability chips; a runner removed from PATH flips unhealthy with the verbatim probe error; an unattended spawn against an unverified adapter is refused when agents.unattended_requires_verified_adapter is on |
| `EI-6` | ⬜ | Runner lifecycle (idle-release/lease/reconnect) + durable tmux-backed sessions | `EI-5`, `EXT:WORK-CONTAINERS:WORK-R8 lease convention (flock under locks/) + WORK-R7 suspended-liveness path` | SC5: killing the gateway mid-run with durable sessions on → the recovery sweep reattaches to the still-alive tmux worker (run resumes suspended→running, journal flags `resumed`), only genuinely dead sessions are tombstoned; a claimed runner idle past TTL is released and its lease holder is visible in Settings |
| `EI-7` | ⬜ | Second-opinion handoff + ProposerBackend + sandbox-internal tool gateway | `EI-1`, `EI-5` | SC6: a stalled loop's "second opinion" fires a DIFFERENT cataloged runner one-shot inside the same sandbox class and is accepted only when the disk re-diff confirms the edits, SEL-audited. SC7: inside a docker/lima sandbox `gideon-tool memory_recall` succeeds while ss/netstat shows zero listening sockets, no credential material exists in the sandbox, and a research-profile sandbox is refused write-class tools host-side |
| `EI-8` | ⬜ | Turn-bound two-phase file checkpointing + /rewind-to-turn + localhost web preview | `EI-1` | SC8: after a turn that mangled three files, /rewind-to-turn N previews exactly those files with diffs and restores them byte-identical on confirm; .env files were never captured; the checkpoint store respects its cap and prunes with the session; a run's dev server port surfaces an "Open Preview" affordance to localhost:<port> |
| `EI-9` | ⬜ | Reviewer-comment triage primitive (line-anchored findings → accepted-subset dispatch) | `EI-5`, `EXT:WORK-CONTAINERS:cockpit diff panel to extend`, `EXT:LEARNING-FLYWHEEL:calibration record for rejections` | SC9: a workflow review stage emits line-anchored findings; the triage panel validates anchors against the real diff; the user accepts 2 of 5; the accepted pair auto-dispatches to the originating worker which applies them; rejected findings land in the calibration record; nothing was auto-written without acceptance |
| `EI-10` | ⬜ | Secrets vault UX + presence-only API + grant-to-sandbox toggles | `EI-1`, `EXT:WORK-CONTAINERS:WORK-R19 secrets store + per-project keychain backend` | SC10: the vault lists global + per-project secrets with presence-only values, inherit-from-host rows rendered distinctly, and consumer links; a secret granted to sandboxed runs reaches a docker leaf's env while an ungranted sibling does not; no value is readable back through any API; project export ZIPs contain presence flags only |
| `EI-11` | ⬜ | Security docs correction — credential-hiding vs confinement (D0, land first) | — | no public surface claims confinement the code does not provide; the guardrails claim names its unattended scope (reusing the Settings panel wording); the desktop claim matches CI reality; security.md has the explicit sandbox does/doesn't section |
| `EI-12` | ⬜ | App-side confinement compounders — env allowlist, network-perm decision, per-app deps (D1/D2/D3+VD) | — | a planted secret in the gateway env is absent from an app backend's env (test proves it); the Store consent UI's network claim matches enforcement reality; an app pinning a conflicting core dependency does not affect the gateway; every first-party app still boots; the VD user-validation sweep holds |

## Atom scopes

**Done when:** sandbox_providers/ package + `none` provider composing sandbox.wrap_argv exists; SubagentManager.spawn(sandbox="none") runs the worker through handle.exec; a child `ulimit -n` reports the ceiling; sandbox.nofile/max_pids/max_rss_mb round-trip via test_config_roundtrip; test_manifest_types_match_handlers passes (type+handler in one commit)

### `EI-2` — `docker` provider + engine/workspace-block adoption + cgroup v2 tier

**Status:** todo

§1.1 docker built-in + failure-honesty/downgrade; §1.3(2) code loops & workflow stage nodes (allowed_write_paths/egress_tier/safety_profile threaded into SandboxSpec); §11 Session 2; Amendment 2026-07-26 EI-A2 (cgroup v2 systemd-run transient scope + doctor probe)

**Done when:** SC1: a stage `sandbox: docker` runs its process tree in a UID-aligned bind-mount container over its WORK-R3 worktree; a write outside allowed_write_paths is blocked by the boundary; a no-Docker machine parks needs-input with a typed reason (no silent host downgrade for unattended). SC2: a subagent `sandbox: docker` without a grant to ~/.gideon/models cannot delete a real local model. Linux fork-bomb child hits pids.max; macOS logs a one-time not-enforced warning

### `EI-3` — Spawn-audit CI test + wrap remaining agent-influenced spawn seams

**Status:** todo

Amendment 2026-07-26 EI-A3: AST spawn-audit vs ceiling-wrapped/operator-exempt map; wrap apps backend, mcp_client/mcp_discovery, acp/transport, schedule_script, loop gates/worktree

**Done when:** tests/test_spawn_ceiling_audit.py is green with every agent-influenced seam ceiling-wrapped or explicitly operator-exempt; adding an unmapped create_subprocess_exec/Popen/StdioServerParameters on a branch fails CI naming the file:line

### `EI-4` — Lima VM tier app + apps-sandbox (#71) + terminal sandbox picker

**Status:** todo

§2 Lima VM Tier (apps/lima-sandbox isolated kind, cached availability probe, host↔guest path translation, degradation dialog); §1.3(3) Terminal per-session sandbox picker; §1.3(4) apps sandbox un-deferred (backend.sandbox manifest field + permissions.network→egress_tier / permissions.storage→allowed_write_paths); §11 Session 3

**Done when:** SC3: with apps/lima-sandbox installed + instance running, a terminal opened "inside the run's sandbox" executes in the VM with correct path translation; stopping the instance flips the provider to greyed-out-with-reason within one probe TTL; an interactive request gets the path-guard-only dialog; app backends launch through backend.sandbox

### `EI-5` — BYO runner data catalog + Gemini CLI runner + adapter pin/verify + Settings→Agents evidence

**Status:** todo

§3.1 runners-stay-apps + <name>.runner.json sidecar (health evidence, capability persistence from normalize_discovery, pinned+sha256 adapter bundles), Gemini first-party app via acp_bundles/_register.py; §3.2 config wiring (agents.runner_* four-point); §11 Session 4

**Done when:** SC4: Settings→Agents shows Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kiro rows with health evidence (last handshake, version, latency) + capability chips; a runner removed from PATH flips unhealthy with the verbatim probe error; an unattended spawn against an unverified adapter is refused when agents.unattended_requires_verified_adapter is on

### `EI-6` — Runner lifecycle (idle-release/lease/reconnect) + durable tmux-backed sessions

**Status:** todo

§3.1(5) idle-release + WORK-R8-style lease record + transparent reconnect; §5.1 durable sessions (deterministic gideon-<project>-<run>-<session> names, reattach-not-reap boot pre-step in both orphan recoveries, agents.durable_sessions flag); §11 Session 5

**Done when:** SC5: killing the gateway mid-run with durable sessions on → the recovery sweep reattaches to the still-alive tmux worker (run resumes suspended→running, journal flags `resumed`), only genuinely dead sessions are tombstoned; a claimed runner idle past TTL is released and its lease holder is visible in Settings

### `EI-7` — Second-opinion handoff + ProposerBackend + sandbox-internal tool gateway

**Status:** todo

§4.1 second-opinion action provider (registered + added to ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS) with handoff brief + fire-wait-verify; §4.2 ProposerBackend 4-method contract + subagent fallback backend; §5.2 gideon-tool shim + loopback-free exec-channel tool gateway; §11 Session 6

**Done when:** SC6: a stalled loop's "second opinion" fires a DIFFERENT cataloged runner one-shot inside the same sandbox class and is accepted only when the disk re-diff confirms the edits, SEL-audited. SC7: inside a docker/lima sandbox `gideon-tool memory_recall` succeeds while ss/netstat shows zero listening sockets, no credential material exists in the sandbox, and a research-profile sandbox is refused write-class tools host-side

### `EI-8` — Turn-bound two-phase file checkpointing + /rewind-to-turn + localhost web preview

**Status:** todo

§6 two-phase checkpoint (identity-set snapshot + pre-edit backup in mcp_core file tools) + /rewind-to-turn (preview diff + confirm, SEL-audited, filesystem-only) + per-session caps; §6.2 localhost web preview (port discovery on the sandbox handle, ephemeral preview_urls); §11 Session 7

**Done when:** SC8: after a turn that mangled three files, /rewind-to-turn N previews exactly those files with diffs and restores them byte-identical on confirm; .env files were never captured; the checkpoint store respects its cap and prunes with the session; a run's dev server port surfaces an "Open Preview" affordance to localhost:<port>

### `EI-9` — Reviewer-comment triage primitive (line-anchored findings → accepted-subset dispatch)

**Status:** todo

§7: consume the approved WORKFLOWS-V2 Canonical Finding record + auto_fixable flag; diff-anchored triage panel with anchor validation against the actual diff; accepted subset auto-dispatched to the originating session (native resume per §3 capability matrix); rejections feed the flywheel calibration; §11 Session 7

**Done when:** SC9: a workflow review stage emits line-anchored findings; the triage panel validates anchors against the real diff; the user accepts 2 of 5; the accepted pair auto-dispatches to the originating worker which applies them; rejected findings land in the calibration record; nothing was auto-written without acceptance

### `EI-10` — Secrets vault UX + presence-only API + grant-to-sandbox toggles

**Status:** todo

§8 (NEW-27 remainder over WORK-R19): Settings→Secrets vault listing global + per-project secrets with presence-only display, inherit-from-host rows as a first-class type, consumer links; GET/POST/DELETE /api/secrets (write-only values); project hub Context tab links; per-secret grant-to-sandboxed-runs toggle populating SandboxSpec.env; §11 Session 7

**Done when:** SC10: the vault lists global + per-project secrets with presence-only values, inherit-from-host rows rendered distinctly, and consumer links; a secret granted to sandboxed runs reaches a docker leaf's env while an ungranted sibling does not; no value is readable back through any API; project export ZIPs contain presence flags only

### `EI-11` — Security docs correction — credential-hiding vs confinement (D0, land first)

**Status:** todo

Amendment 2026-07-29 (b) + task D0 — docs-only, dependency-free: correct the website boundary diagram/copy, qualify the guardrails claim to unattended work, qualify the desktop-platform claim, add a "what the sandbox does and does not do" section to docs/architecture/security.md

**Done when:** no public surface claims confinement the code does not provide; the guardrails claim names its unattended scope (reusing the Settings panel wording); the desktop claim matches CI reality; security.md has the explicit sandbox does/doesn't section

### `EI-12` — App-side confinement compounders — env allowlist, network-perm decision, per-app deps (D1/D2/D3+VD)

**Status:** todo

Amendment 2026-07-29 (a) + tasks D1 (backend env by allowlist not dict(os.environ), sensitive-prefix scrub floor), D2 (permissions.network: enforce via egress rail OR mark advisory in consent UI/manifest — not both/neither), D3 (per-app pythonDependencies isolated to app-scoped target so an app cannot shadow a core dep), VD (validation-as-a-user sweep)

**Done when:** a planted secret in the gateway env is absent from an app backend's env (test proves it); the Store consent UI's network claim matches enforcement reality; an app pinning a conflicting core dependency does not affect the gateway; every first-party app still boots; the VD user-validation sweep holds
