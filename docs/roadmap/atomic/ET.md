# ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING`](../plans/ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING.md)  
**Code:** `ET`  
**Source status:** proposed



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ET-1` | ✅ | `gideon app new` scaffold: provider-registry-derived type table + per-type generators + conformance test | `EXT:PROVIDER-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION:manifest cli.*/loggerRoots fields the scaffold emits`, `EXT:PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY:manifest self-description enabling the runtime-derived type table`, `EXT:CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING:apps-repo CI the generated output must pass as-generated` | `gideon app new --list-types` prints a type table derived at runtime from the provider registry (adding an upstream capability type appears without editing the generator); for EVERY type, generate→`pytest <dir>` passes→local-source install succeeds→provider registers (scripted test loop); each type emits valid app.json (incl. plan-32 cli.*/loggerRoots), a minimal ABC-implementing provider stub, passing stub-based test_provider.py, README, MIT LICENSE; tests/test_app_scaffold.py generates each type into tmp and runs apps-repo checks so scaffold drift = red; V1 timed stranger-shaped `search`-app run recorded (<30 min target) |
| `ET-2` | ✅ | Template repo content (`gideon/app-template`) + app-creation-guide scaffold quickstart | `ET-1` | the scaffold's `--type tool` output plus apps-repo CI config and a clone-to-installed README are prepared in-tree under scratch/ (owner pushes to the org repo); apps-repo docs/app-creation-guide gains a 'minutes to first run' quickstart at the top; quickstart tested verbatim; `app new --from-template` fetches the template repo |
| `ET-3` | ✅ | Registry data tier: `registry.json` schema + PR-validation workflow in the `gideon/registry` repo | `EXT:OSS-OPERATIONS:front-door / community-listing policy the registry front-door adopts` | registry.json schema + validation script (manifest fetch/parse via core apps/manifest.py, repo liveness, license present, SkillScanner dry-run verdict capture) + PR CI running it prepared as registry-repo content with CONTRIBUTING-for-listings and delisting policy; a valid sample PR passes; a `dangerous`-verdict fixture blocks listing with the reason recorded; `warning` lists-with-display (never auto-blocks) |
| `ET-4` | ⬜ | Default-source seeding: ship the registry URL as a removable default git source | `ET-3` | registry URL seeds into app-sources.json on first run behind a config flag; Settings sources UI shows it as a removable default; a fresh dev home lists registry apps in the Store; removing the source persists across restart; the scanner gate at install is unchanged (no new install path) |
| `ET-5` | ⬜ | Store-card provenance line for registry-sourced apps + end-to-end install validation | `ET-4` | registry-sourced Store cards show maintainer + last_validated (+ last_scan_verdict) from the catalog payload, with copy that reads as community-listed not endorsed; local/first-party cards unchanged; V2: list→install→use a registry app end to end holds and the scan gate still runs at install (a deliberate warning-fixture app shows the consent surface) |
| `ET-6` | ✅ | Build the four scaffold-generated exemplar apps and list them in the registry | `ET-1`, `ET-3`, `EXT:WATCHED-SOURCES:watched-source provider contract the github exemplar implements` | all four exemplars scaffold-generated then minimally implemented (each ≤300 LOC, README-led), each installs from its git URL through the Store and is registry-listed; V3: fork-simulate one exemplar (clone, rename, install) proves the third-party path end to end post-registry. NOTE: watched-source-github's provider shape must track the WATCHED-SOURCES contract; action-home-assistant may be community-validated if no HA instance (Owner task 4) |
| `ET-7` | ⬜ | Bounty board: labeled `bounty` issues for wanted apps, linking scaffold/guide/conformance | `ET-1`, `ET-2`, `EXT:CHANNEL-EXPANSION:channel wants-list (T7.3) the channel bounties draw from` | ≥6 `bounty` GitHub issues live (channels + providers + sources from the wants-list), each linking the scaffold, guide, and conformance kit; showcase thread seeded in the community surface. Channel bounties draw from CHANNEL-EXPANSION's wants-list (T7.3) and its channel scaffold template |
| `ET-8` | ⬜ | Registry surface on gideon.dev generated from `registry.json` | `ET-3`, `EXT:DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH:the site sync pipeline this registry surface extends` | static registry pages generated on gideon.dev from registry.json (cards: name/types/permissions/verdict/maintainer; per-app page with README fetch); declared permissions + last scan verdict visible pre-install; a rebuild picks up registry changes; V4: a merged registry PR appears on the site after rebuild and card data matches the Store consent surface |
| `ET-9` | ⬜ | Owner: create the github.com/Gideon/registry public repo (gates ET-4) | `ET-3` | github.com/Gideon/registry exists as a public repo seeded from scratch/registry/ (post-ET-4a rename) with the ET-3 PR-validation workflow wired; ET-4's default-source seeding then resolves real registry apps — OWNER-ONLY, belongs on gated_frontier |
| `ET-10` | ✅ | Owner: provision GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) publish credentials (gates ET-8) | `ET-3` | Done (superseded by shipped reality, audit 2026-09-05): release.yml already publishes multi-arch GHCR images with the workflow's own GITHUB_TOKEN (permissions packages:write, 'no extra secret') since tag v0.1.3 — there are no credentials to provision. Residual owner action (confirm/make packages public) is covered by CRE-7; the claimed ET-8 gating was a premise error (ET-8 reads registry.json and never references GHCR). |

## Atom scopes

### `ET-1` — `gideon app new` scaffold: provider-registry-derived type table + per-type generators + conformance test

**Status:** todo

Session 1 (T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, V1); C1 — Scaffold (src/gideon/cli_app_new.py, wired via §3.10 subparser)

**Done when:** `gideon app new --list-types` prints a type table derived at runtime from the provider registry (adding an upstream capability type appears without editing the generator); for EVERY type, generate→`pytest <dir>` passes→local-source install succeeds→provider registers (scripted test loop); each type emits valid app.json (incl. plan-32 cli.*/loggerRoots), a minimal ABC-implementing provider stub, passing stub-based test_provider.py, README, MIT LICENSE; tests/test_app_scaffold.py generates each type into tmp and runs apps-repo checks so scaffold drift = red; V1 timed stranger-shaped `search`-app run recorded (<30 min target)

### `ET-2` — Template repo content (`gideon/app-template`) + app-creation-guide scaffold quickstart

**Status:** todo

Session 1 (T1.4); Design — Template repo; Owner tasks 1 (owner pushes the org repo)

**Done when:** the scaffold's `--type tool` output plus apps-repo CI config and a clone-to-installed README are prepared in-tree under scratch/ (owner pushes to the org repo); apps-repo docs/app-creation-guide gains a 'minutes to first run' quickstart at the top; quickstart tested verbatim; `app new --from-template` fetches the template repo

### `ET-3` — Registry data tier: `registry.json` schema + PR-validation workflow in the `gideon/registry` repo

**Status:** done

Session 2 (T2.1); C2 — registry.json schema; Design — Registry; Owner tasks 1 & 2 (owner creates repo, approves delisting policy)

**Done when:** registry.json schema + validation script (manifest fetch/parse via core apps/manifest.py, repo liveness, license present, SkillScanner dry-run verdict capture) + PR CI running it prepared as registry-repo content with CONTRIBUTING-for-listings and delisting policy; a valid sample PR passes; a `dangerous`-verdict fixture blocks listing with the reason recorded; `warning` lists-with-display (never auto-blocks)

### `ET-4` — Default-source seeding: ship the registry URL as a removable default git source

**Status:** todo

Session 2 (T2.2); C2 — 'registry repo URL ships as a default git source'

**`ET-4a` landed 2026-08-27** (carved out of this atom): `scratch/registry/registry.json` is now
`app-registry.json`, i.e. `catalog._REGISTRY_FILENAME`. That clears the THIRD of the three measured
blockers on the 'a fresh dev home lists registry apps in the Store' clause. The clause stays UNMET
and this row stays `⬜` — the other two blockers are outside core: (1) `github.com/Gideon/registry`
does not exist yet (owner task 1), (2) the staged index is `{"apps": []}` until `ET-6`. **The rename had
to precede the public repo**: `scratch/registry/` becomes that repo verbatim, so renaming afterwards
would be a breaking change on a repo third parties may have cloned or scripted against.

**Done when:** registry URL seeds into app-sources.json on first run behind a config flag; Settings sources UI shows it as a removable default; a fresh dev home lists registry apps in the Store; removing the source persists across restart; the scanner gate at install is unchanged (no new install path)

### `ET-5` — Store-card provenance line for registry-sourced apps + end-to-end install validation

**Status:** todo

Session 2 (T2.3, V2); C2 — Store integration; Risks — trust-washing ('community-listed, scanned at install')

**Done when:** registry-sourced Store cards show maintainer + last_validated (+ last_scan_verdict) from the catalog payload, with copy that reads as community-listed not endorsed; local/first-party cards unchanged; V2: list→install→use a registry app end to end holds and the scan gate still runs at install (a deliberate warning-fixture app shows the consent surface)

### `ET-6` — Build the four scaffold-generated exemplar apps and list them in the registry

**Status:** todo

Session 3 (T3.1, V3); Design — Exemplars (watched-source-github, action-home-assistant, inbox-github-notifications, channel-null)

**Done when:** all four exemplars scaffold-generated then minimally implemented (each ≤300 LOC, README-led), each installs from its git URL through the Store and is registry-listed; V3: fork-simulate one exemplar (clone, rename, install) proves the third-party path end to end post-registry. NOTE: watched-source-github's provider shape must track the WATCHED-SOURCES contract; action-home-assistant may be community-validated if no HA instance (Owner task 4)

### `ET-7` — Bounty board: labeled `bounty` issues for wanted apps, linking scaffold/guide/conformance

**Status:** blocked (wants-list shipped and machine-checked; publishing community bounty issues is an owner action)

Session 3 (T3.2); Design — Bounty board; Owner tasks 3 (reward model: recognition-only recommended)

**Done when:** ≥6 `bounty` GitHub issues live (channels + providers + sources from the wants-list), each linking the scaffold, guide, and conformance kit; showcase thread seeded in the community surface. Channel bounties draw from CHANNEL-EXPANSION's wants-list (T7.3) and its channel scaffold template

### `ET-8` — Registry surface on gideon.dev generated from `registry.json`

**Status:** todo

Session 4 (T4.1, V4); Design — Registry surface (S4)

**Done when:** static registry pages generated on gideon.dev from registry.json (cards: name/types/permissions/verdict/maintainer; per-app page with README fetch); declared permissions + last scan verdict visible pre-install; a rebuild picks up registry changes; V4: a merged registry PR appears on the site after rebuild and card data matches the Store consent surface


### `ET-9` — Owner: create the github.com/Gideon/registry public repo (gates ET-4)

**Status:** todo — OWNER-ONLY (belongs on gated_frontier, never ready_frontier)

ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING owner task 1, minted as an explicit atom so its gate is legible on the roadmap. The registry data tier (ET-3, done) and the app-registry.json rename (ET-4a, landed 2026-08-27) are in place; ET-4's remaining "a fresh dev home lists registry apps in the Store" blocker is that github.com/Gideon/registry does not exist yet. Creating it publishes scratch/registry/ verbatim and MUST follow the ET-4a rename, or the rename becomes a breaking change on a repo third parties may have cloned.

**Done when:** github.com/Gideon/registry exists as a public repo seeded from scratch/registry/ (post-ET-4a rename) with the ET-3 PR-validation workflow wired; ET-4's default-source seeding then resolves real registry apps

### `ET-10` — Owner: provision GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) publish credentials (gates ET-8)

**Status:** ✅ done — superseded by shipped reality (inventory audit 2026-09-05). `.github/workflows/release.yml:127`
has published multi-arch GHCR images authenticated with the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` since v0.1.3; there are
no publish credentials to provision, which was this atom's whole done_when. The residual (make/confirm the packages
public — the anonymous package page 404s) is an owner console action already covered verbatim by CRE-7's done_when,
and the claimed gating of ET-8 was a premise error: ET-8's registry surface reads `registry.json` and references
GHCR nowhere.

Owner provisioning for the container/registry publication path ET-8's gideon.dev registry surface depends on. Minted as an explicit owner atom so the gate is legible.

**Done when:** GHCR publish credentials are provisioned in the CI environment so the artifacts ET-8's registry surface references can be published; ET-8's site-sync consumes them
