# HARNESS-CRAFT — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`HARNESS-CRAFT`](../plans/HARNESS-CRAFT.md)  
**Code:** `HC`  
**Source status:** proposed



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

## Atom scopes

### `HC-1` — Worktree instrumentation + fan-out-of-4 benchmark & measure-first gate

**Status:** done

§1.1 Measure first; §Implementation Effort Session 1 (instrumentation/benchmark half)

**Done when:** create_worktree logs a duration line tagged with the repo size class (git ls-files count, cached per workspace); a fan-out-of-4 on a >=10K-file benchmark repo has a recorded baseline setup time; the <2s-per-worktree gate is evaluated and its outcome (proceed to HC-2, or SKIP+re-scope) is documented. Instrumentation ships regardless of the gate.

**DONE.** The plan names `create_worktree`; the function is `loop.worktree.add_worktree` — the one
real worktree creator, with both production callers going through it (`loop/kinds/sdlc.py` fan-out,
`workflows/provisioning.py`). It now emits one stable line per call:
`worktree add outcome=created task=t-x ms=812 files=10432 size_class=large`. `outcome` is
`created|reused|failed` because a fan-out's populations must not be averaged together — the
idempotent early return is near-zero and a `failed` row carries the duration that burned the 30s
`_TIMEOUT`, which is the most informative row on the page. The tracked-file count is cached per
workspace abspath for the process (`git ls-files` on the repo being timed would make the
instrumentation a share of the cost it reports), and the class is resolved AFTER the clock stops so
a cache miss is never charged to the checkout.

`harness/worktree_bench.py` (+ `python -m harness worktree-bench`) is the benchmark. It parses the
SHIPPED log line rather than keeping its own stopwatch, so the reported number is the number
production emits — and the log-line contract gains a real reader. This repo has 3,047 tracked files
and does not qualify, so the benchmark synthesizes a deterministic 10,000-file repo under a temp
dir (nothing enters the tree; content is a function of the file index, so re-runs are comparable).

**Measured baseline — fan-out of 4, 10,000-file repo, sequential (today's path):**
samples `[10442, 4501, 2947, 2975]` ms · mean **5216 ms/worktree** · median 3738 · max 10442 ·
spread 7495 · sequential total **20.9 s**. Same-window 40-file control arm: mean **286 ms**, spread
18 ms — the ambient floor (process spawn + git startup + load), so ~2.7 s of even the cheapest
benchmark sample is hydration, not machine.

**Gate verdict: `proceed` to `HC-2`** — unanimous, the cheapest of the four worktrees being 2947 ms,
947 ms over the 2000 ms gate. **Caveat, stated because it is load-bearing:** measured under
concurrent load (load average 21–35 on 18 cores; other agents running test suites and builds), so
the numbers are pessimistic, and the margin at the FLOOR is thin — a ~1.25x idle speedup would put
the cheapest sample inside the unresolved band. Re-confirm on an idle machine before `HC-2` spends
real effort. An earlier trial in the same session recorded a second, load-independent bottleneck
signal: one of the four worktrees FAILED outright at the 30 s git `_TIMEOUT`, i.e. at this repo size
a fan-out does not merely get slow, it can drop a task's worktree.

The gate requires UNANIMITY over the samples rather than comparing a mean to the threshold. That is
a correction the measurement itself forced: a four-sample fan-out is right-skewed (cold cache, one
unlucky sample), so a mean-versus-threshold test would have decided an atom's fate on which sample
got descheduled. Under-size repos, narrower fan-outs, empty arms and straddling samples all return
`unresolved`. Instrumentation shipped independently of the verdict, as the `done_when` requires.

### `HC-2` — Sparse + parallel + reuse worktree hydration with loop.worktree_sparse config

**Status:** done

§1.2 Sparse + shallow hydration; §1.3 Doctrine unchanged

**Done when:** Scoped SDLC tasks create sparse worktrees hydrating only target paths; an out-of-scope write auto-widens (git sparse-checkout add) without failing; phase-READY worktree creation batches through a bounded (cpu_count, ceil 4) thread pool; a reuse pool resets surviving worktrees (checkout -B + clean -fd) between phases and tears down to remove+add on any reset failure; merge-back is diff-identical to full checkouts; loop.worktree_sparse (default true) round-trips through the four wiring points (dataclass _meta, load, to_dict, _EDITABLE_CONFIG+FE); existing worktree tests plus a fan-out timing assertion pass (SC 1, 2, 7).

### `HC-3` — Best-of-N sampling core (sampling.py) + bundled best-of-n skill

**Status:** blocked (implementation complete; the live end-to-end clause needs an owner run)

§2.1 The core: sampling.py helper; §2.2 The skill: skills/bundled/best-of-n/SKILL.md

**Done when:** best_of_n(prompt,n,judge_criteria,use_case) fires N temperature-varied parallel one_shot_completion calls through the ModelCallGuard chokepoint, LLMJudge scores each and returns winner+candidates+judgments, and appends a bounded record (ts,n,criteria_digest,winner_idx,score_spread,tokens_total) to ~/.gideon/sampling_outcomes.jsonl (snapshot-excluded); skills/bundled/best-of-n/SKILL.md confirms N (cap 5)+criteria naming the N-call cost multiplier (grill ambiguous-trigger precedent), presents winner with collapsible runners-up and a working 'use #2' choice; chat 'give me 3 versions and pick the best' validated end-to-end with all N calls visible in model_calls.jsonl (SC 3, 4).

**DONE.** `src/gideon/sampling.py` owns the core: one `asyncio.gather` fan-out of N
temperature-varied `one_shot_completion` calls (ladder `0.2/0.7/1.0/0.45/0.85`, N clamped to
`MAX_N=5`) through the use-case bridge → ModelCallGuard, then a sequential `LLMJudge` pass over the
survivors and a deterministic pick (`max(score)`, ties to the lowest index). Partial-tolerant: one
dead sample loses that candidate only; all-N-dead returns an explicit `winner=None` envelope; a dead
judge returns the slate `judged=False`. Temperature is a REAL sampling parameter now — new
`one_shot_completion(temperature=…)` threads it through every resolution path as a bridge build
kwarg, and `sdk/provider_helpers.py` puts it in the provider's `extra_options` (the `embedding_model`
precedent), where both protocol clients already forward call params. Each call appends the bounded
`{ts,n,criteria_digest,winner_idx,score_spread,tokens_total}` record to `sampling_outcomes.jsonl`,
declared `derived=True` in the durability inventory — which is what "snapshot-excluded" means here
(claimed by `audit_home()`, never backed up). The chat half is live, not inert: bundled
`skills/bundled/best-of-n/SKILL.md` (grill's explicit-vs-ambiguous gate, the N-call cost named in the
confirmation, `<details>` runners-up and a verbatim "use #2") drives the new `best_of_n` MCP tool in
`mcp_subagents.py`, which calls the same core the HC-5 template will. 22 tests in
`tests/test_sampling_best_of_n.py` — concurrency is proven by a peak-in-flight==N counter plus a
fan-out span assertion (a sequential loop fails both), partial tolerance and determinism each have a
falsified test.

### `HC-4` — Check-work skill + SDLC post-gate hook + chat suggestion chip

**Status:** done

§3.1 The skill: skills/bundled/check-work/SKILL.md; §3.2 Composition, not duplication (SDLC post-gate hook + QA-Companion boundary doc); §3.3 Chat surfacing

**Done when:** skills/bundled/check-work/SKILL.md reconstructs session claims, derives 2-4 executable checks, runs them with real tool calls (unverifiable checks reported as such, never assumed passing), and reports pass/fail with evidence; an adversarial planted-flaw case is caught with zero self-reported passes; loop.check_work_stages (default off) runs the same check-derivation module after a passing SDLC gate and catches a claimed-but-missing file; chat.offer_check_work (default on) offers a 'Check this work' chip after >=3-tool-call completion turns (invocation always user-clicked); the QA-Companion light-vs-deep boundary doc is present; both config bools round-trip through the four wiring points (SC 5, 6, 7). Soft, non-blocking: delegates deep-verify escalation to SELF-VERIFICATION S3 QA Companion only if that has landed.

**DONE.** `gideon/check_work.py` is the one derivation core (reconstruct → derive
2-4 → execute → report); both entry points call it, so skill and hook can never diverge.
`skills/bundled/check-work/SKILL.md` + `references/qa-boundary.md` ship it (packaged via a
new `skills/bundled/*/references/*.md` glob). `CodeKind._check_work_post_gate` runs it
after a passing stage gate behind `loops.check_work_stages` (default off, fails OPEN) and
holds the stage on a failed derived check. `dashboard.offer_check_work` (default on)
broadcasts `chat_check_work_offer` after a ≥3-tool-call completion turn; the FE
`CheckWorkChip` sends "check your work" only on a click. 39 tests in
`tests/test_check_work.py`, incl. the adversarial planted-flaw case (pass/fail/
unverifiable with zero self-reported passes).

**DEVIATIONS.** (1) Config sections are `loops.check_work_stages` and
`dashboard.offer_check_work`, not the plan's `loop.`/`chat.` — this repo has no `loop` or
`chat` config section; the chat-surface prefs (incl. `followup_chips`, the §3.3 chip
surface) live in `dashboard`. (2) Wiring point 4 for `loops.check_work_stages` is the
`_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist with no Settings control: NOTHING in `web/` reads
`config.loops` (its siblings `judge_use_case`/`stagnation_window` have none either), so a
Loops settings panel would be new scope. `dashboard.offer_check_work` is user-facing and
does get a toggle + typed API field. (3) The module never shells out on its own
authority — command checks need an injected runner, else they are `unverifiable`.

**DISCOVERY.** Running the skill on its own session caught a real defect in the core: the
bare-path scan re-matched `work/SKILL.md` out of the backticked
`…/bundled/check-work/SKILL.md`, inventing a claim that then FAILED. Fixed (scan runs on
the sentence with backticked spans removed) with a regression test.

### `HC-5` — v2 workflow templates for best-of-n and check-work (engine-native halves)

**Status:** todo

§2.3 The template: v2 judge-panel consumer; §3.2 Workflow template (check-work node); Success Criteria 8

**Done when:** A best-of-n workflow template (fan-out N -> judge -> select) and a check-work node template run engine-side, each CALLING the §2.1/§3.1 cores (no reimplementation) so template and skill are behaviorally identical; a shared-core test exercising both skill and template entry points is green (SC 8).
