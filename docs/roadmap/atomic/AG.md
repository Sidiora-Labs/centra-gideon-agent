# AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS`](../plans/AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS.md)  
**Code:** `AG`  
**Source status:** in_progress

Plan is IN PROGRESS: the S1-S4 substrate (chokepoint, budgets/scan, floor, profiles/egress/health/FE) is fully shipped, and the S5.1/S5.2/S6.1 earned-autonomy rung ladder is now COMPLETE end to end (decision layer, routing at all three dispatch seams, promotion proposals, the HTTP ladder + undo executor, and the FE chip/panel/undo affordance). Five todo atoms remain: the inert SafetyProfile/egress-tier wiring gap (audit 2026-08-04, independently completable) and four logged deferrals (apps-repo native structured_output + channel send() live-writes; run-scope budgets awaiting AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE; profile/trust enforcement behaviors awaiting WORKFLOWS-V2 engine per-template profiles).

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

| Atom | Status | Title | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AG-1` | ✅ | Model-call chokepoint core (§2): ModelCallGuard, breaker, timeout, audit, output_type | — | ModelCallGuard wraps the bridge-resolved reasoning-use-case provider; breaker/hard-timeout/JSONL audit live; one_shot_completion(output_type=…) returns typed data via targeted retry with zero silent None at migrated sites; full gate green (7820 passed) — DONE per Execution log 2026-07-25 |
| `AG-2` | ✅ | Budgets + outbound scan + GuardrailsConfig (§1.1, §2.2) | `AG-1` | a per-minute trigger hitting its per-day token/dollar ceiling pauses into needs-input and auto-resumes next day; a secret-shaped payload is blocked at scan (secret_leak, non-retryable); config round-trips — DONE per log 2026-07-25 (7838 passed) |
| `AG-3` | ✅ | Safety floor: denylist + incident kill switch + DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES + guard_flag (§1.2-§1.4, §5) | `AG-2` | incident stops every unattended fire within one poll interval (chat untouched, explicit-confirm resume, SEL-audited); a denylisted ~/.ssh/** or **/.env* path refused by every provider incl. app webhook-action; suite runs with DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES auto-set — DONE per log 2026-07-25 (7876 passed) |
| `AG-4` | ✅ | Safety profiles + egress tiers + provider health view + FE (§3, §4.2, §2.5, §4.4) | `AG-1`, `AG-2`, `AG-3` | Settings→Guardrails renders breaker state + p50/p90/p99 latency; profile_for_session classifies unattended session keys → HEADLESS read-only; egress tiers resolve; full web gate green — DONE per log 2026-07-25 (7898 passed, 231 vitest) |
| `AG-5` | ✅ | Wire SafetyProfile / egress-tier into dispatch seams + spawn (close inert control) | `AG-4` | at least one dispatch/spawn seam consults profile_for_session in production; SafetyProfile.tool_grants/denylist_extra/egress_tier have non-test readers; Success Criterion #7 (unattended run resolves through HEADLESS by construction) holds outside tests/test_guardrails_profiles.py |
| `AG-6` | ✅ | S5.1 earned-autonomy rung ladder core (guardrails/autonomy.py) | `AG-4`, `EXT:FEEDBACK-SIGNAL:S1 👍/👎 records feed derived eligibility` | a type with 10 clean approvals over 7 days + 0 rejections is eligible; one rejection demotes immediately and starts cooldown; incident clamps resolution above one_tap; eligibility is recomputed, never cached to disk — DONE 2026-08-12 (18701 passed, 50 new) |
| `AG-7` | ✅ | S5.2 action-type declarations + manifest autonomy block + rung routing at seams | `AG-6`, `AG-5`, `EXT:INBOX-NOTIF-UNIFICATION:emit_attention_item(kind=proposal) for draft_only routing — pre-42 skills/proposals.py fallback keeps this unblocked` | an app-contributed action inherits its declared floor/ceiling with no dispatch-layer special-casing; a leaves_machine type cannot resolve autonomous without an explicit ceiling raise — DONE 2026-08-12 (18793 passed, 29 new; 3 pre-existing worktree-only harness_validate failures). DEVIATION: the plan's third seam `gateway._run_action_job` retired with `ScheduleService` (S112); its successor `gateway._fire_store_trigger` is routed instead. `one_tap` raises a durable agent-request row rather than `ApprovalGate.request` (a per-native-session in-process Future, unreachable from an unattended seam) — the one-tap CARD is AG-8. |
| `AG-8` | ✅ | S6.1 promotion proposals + rung FE chips/ladder panel/undo + validation sweep | `AG-7` | promotion never happens without a click; an undo click both reverses the action and demotes the type; the rung chip answers 'why is this allowed to run by itself?' in one glance; full web gate green — DONE 2026-08-12 (18834 passed + 3 pre-existing worktree-only harness_validate failures; 1824 vitest, 191 files; tsc + build clean; 40 new backend tests). `guardrails/ladder.py` (reversal store + undo executor + proposal scan + the panel's inventory), `GET/POST /api/autonomy{,/grant,/demote,/undo}`, `ActionProvider.reverse`/`reversal_kinds` with `create-task` implementing both, and the FE `RungChip` + Settings→Guardrails ladder panel + notification undo. DEVIATION: the one-tap card's execute-on-approve REPLAY is not built (it needs a durable action-config replay the withhold surface owns, not the ladder) — the withheld row is already visible in the inbox. LAST ATOM of the ladder track; the plan's remaining atoms are AG-5 (inert profile wiring) and the four logged cross-repo/engine deferrals. |
| `AG-9` | ✅ | Apps-repo guardrails follow-ons: native structured_output + channel send() live-writes (cross-repo) | `AG-1`, `AG-3` | an ollama-bound output_type call uses native json-schema format; a channel app's send() returns a typed refusal under DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES; core's structured_output dispatch hook is exercised natively |
| `AG-10` | ✅ | Run-scope budget enforcement + per-trigger budget fields | `AG-2`, `EXT:AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE:Trigger.gates contract must exist before building this seam` | a run crossing its per-run ceiling mid-flight has its next LLM call refused and the run parked; per-trigger budget fields round-trip on Trigger.gates |
| `AG-11` | ✅ | Deferred profile/trust enforcement behaviors awaiting engine consumers | `AG-5`, `EXT:WORKFLOWS-V2:engine per-template profiles + project-script-execution seam (project loop.md / Code-loop deliverable gate)` | auto-fired research spawns default-deny write/execute tools; gateway approval resolves through profile_for_session; a project folder's first script touch prompts Trust vs Preview and persists the decision |
| `AG-12` | ✅ (#PENDING) | Restore the §1.2 denylist at the third dispatch seam (gateway._fire_store_trigger) | `AG-3`, `AG-7` | `_fire_store_trigger` calls `enforce_action` before `provider.execute` and a block short-circuits without executing; the refusal is observable (SEL row + needs_human notification + a `skipped_gate` Runs-history row naming the matched rule); a test drives a REAL trigger fire and asserts the provider was never reached, plus the allowed inverse; `session_key` threaded so the run's SafetyProfile layers as at the other two seams; the chokepoint rail asserts all three execution seams carry the denylist — DONE 2026-08-13 (18921 passed + 3 pre-existing worktree-only harness_validate failures; 15 new tests) |
| `AG-13` | ✅ | Consolidate the fourteen autonomy knobs into one declarative policy (shared with SupervisorPolicy) | `AG-7`, `PP-14` | One declarative policy composes the fourteen knobs tightest-wins under the `Ceiling ∩ Profile` model, and it is the SAME object `PP-14` declares — a run's supervisor policy and its autonomy ceiling are one declaration, not two. Every existing knob keeps its current effective value for every shipped template and bundled loop kind: a table maps each of the fourteen to its policy field and a test asserts the composed answer equals today's answer for a matrix of runs, so this is a consolidation and not a behaviour change. The path-matcher rule PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5 lifted verbatim applies here (never `normpath` a PATTERN — `/a/**/../b` collapses to `/a/b` and silently widens an allow). `AG-11`'s deferred profile/trust behaviours are re-pointed at the consolidated object rather than executed twice. |

### `AG-3` — Safety floor: denylist + incident kill switch + DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES + guard_flag (§1.2-§1.4, §5)

**Status:** done

§1.2 check_action/enforce_action at the three dispatch seams (hooks/gateway/event_triggers) + sdk.guardrails re-exports; §1.3 incident.json flag + seam checks + GET|POST /api/incident + CLI; §1.4 DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES honored (net.fetch, delete_model) + conftest auto-set; §5 guard_flag fail-safe parser + safe-default schema test (Session 3)

### `AG-5` — Wire SafetyProfile / egress-tier into dispatch seams + spawn (close inert control)

**Status:** todo

Status-line audit finding 2026-08-04: §3 profile_for_session + §4.2 egress_policy_for_tier consumed at the three dispatch seams (hooks.run_script_hook, gateway._run_action_job, event_triggers._fire) + SubagentManager.spawn, giving SafetyProfile.tool_grants/denylist_extra/egress_tier real (non-test) readers. Plan assigns this to S5.2 but it carries no FEEDBACK-SIGNAL dep, so it is independently completable.

**Done when:** at least one dispatch/spawn seam consults profile_for_session in production; SafetyProfile.tool_grants/denylist_extra/egress_tier have non-test readers; Success Criterion #7 (unattended run resolves through HEADLESS by construction) holds outside tests/test_guardrails_profiles.py

### `AG-6` — S5.1 earned-autonomy rung ladder core (guardrails/autonomy.py)

**Status:** done (2026-08-12)

Amendment 2026-07-26 §Contract-level design + S5.1 row: RUNGS ladder, ActionTypeSpec, register_action_type, resolve_rung (floor+grants clamped to ceiling, incident_active() clamp above one_tap), DERIVED promotion_eligibility over SEL tool_approved/tool_rejected + FEEDBACK-SIGNAL records, demote+cooldown; autonomy_rungs.json store (grants/demotions only); guardrails.autonomy config through the four wiring points

**Done when:** a type with 10 clean approvals over 7 days + 0 rejections is eligible; one rejection demotes immediately and starts cooldown; incident clamps resolution above one_tap; eligibility is recomputed, never cached to disk

### `AG-7` — S5.2 action-type declarations + manifest autonomy block + rung routing at seams

**Status:** done (2026-08-12)

Amendment S5.2 row: core action-type keys registered from `action_providers/registry.py` + the inbox AI affordances (`inbox.reply_draft`, `inbox.classify`, `sessions.auto_tag`) via `guardrails/rungs.CORE_ACTION_TYPES`; additive manifest `autonomy:{floor,ceiling}` block (`apps/manifest.AutonomyConfig`, keyed `app:<name>.<action>` at `ActionTypeHandler.register`, with a core-derived `leaves_machine` from the app's own `permissions.network` and an audited ceiling clamp); rung routing composed with `enforce_action` at the two `enforce_action` seams (`hooks.run_script_hook`, `event_triggers.execute_event_action`) **plus `gateway._fire_store_trigger`** — the seam the plan's retired `_run_action_job` became — and with `profile_for_session` via `policy.rung_ceiling_for_profile` (draft_only→proposal item, one_tap→agent-request item, auto_with_undo→execute + `ActionResult.reversal` handle + passive notify, autonomous→SEL)

**Done when:** an app-contributed action inherits its declared floor/ceiling with no dispatch-layer special-casing; a leaves_machine type cannot resolve autonomous without an explicit ceiling raise

### `AG-8` — S6.1 promotion proposals + rung FE chips/ladder panel/undo + validation sweep

**Status:** done (2026-08-12)

Amendment S6.1 row: user-click promotion proposals (SEL-audited like a skill install); FE rung chip on trigger/job rows + ladder panel in Settings→Guardrails (current rung, derived record, demotion history) + undo affordance on auto_with_undo notifications; as-a-user validation sweep

**Done when:** promotion never happens without a click; an undo click both reverses the action and demotes the type; the rung chip answers 'why is this allowed to run by itself?' in one glance; full web gate green

### `AG-9` — Apps-repo guardrails follow-ons: native structured_output + channel send() live-writes (cross-repo)

**Status:** todo

Session-1 deferral: BrandedProviderSpec.structured_output declaration + native json-schema enforcement (ollama format= / OpenAI-wire response_format) lighting up core's capability-dispatch hook (§2.4, Success Criterion #6 ollama half). Session-3 deferral: channel-transport send() calls sdk.guardrails.live_writes_disabled() before transmit (§1.4). Both are GideonApps commits against seams core already shipped.

**Done when:** an ollama-bound output_type call uses native json-schema format; a channel app's send() returns a typed refusal under DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES; core's structured_output dispatch hook is exercised natively

### `AG-10` — Run-scope budget enforcement + per-trigger budget fields

**Status:** todo

Session-2 deferral of §1.1 run scope: thread a run-key through dispatch to activate SpendMeter's already-built run scope; add per-trigger budget fields as Trigger.gates {budget:{...}} so the pause becomes a needs-input run in the Runs inbox

**Done when:** a run crossing its per-run ceiling mid-flight has its next LLM call refused and the run parked; per-trigger budget fields round-trip on Trigger.gates

### `AG-11` — Deferred profile/trust enforcement behaviors awaiting engine consumers

**Status:** done

Session-4 deferrals: §4.1 read-only research subagent class (SubagentManager.spawn capability_class; default-deny write/execute enforced by the tool-approval layer); the live cron-approval rewire from the ad-hoc AUTO_APPROVE/HOOK_BASED branch to profile_for_session; §4.3 Trust/Preview project-folder gate (project_trust.json, Preview→REVIEW_ONLY) for project-script execution

**Done when:** auto-fired research spawns default-deny write/execute tools; gateway approval resolves through profile_for_session; a project folder's first script touch prompts Trust vs Preview and persists the decision


### `AG-12` — Restore the §1.2 denylist at the third dispatch seam (gateway._fire_store_trigger)

**Status:** done (2026-08-13)

§1.2 enforcement placement — the third of the three dispatch seams. §1.2 declares the denylist is enforced at all three "so an app-contributed provider inherits the denylist without knowing it exists" and names the third `gateway.py:701` (`_run_action_job`), which retired with `ScheduleService` (S112). Its successor `_fire_store_trigger` kept the kill switch and gained AG-7's rung routing but never re-established the denylist. Measured `enforce_action` per seam file: `hooks.py` 1, `event_triggers.py` 1, `gateway.py` **0** — while gateway is the dispatch path for every clock, file, webhook and chained trigger, the busiest unattended path in the product.

**Population measured before enforcing** (an enforced dead control is an outage): the only real store available (the workspace dev home, read-only) held one trigger — `notification-digest`, empty config — so 0 would be blocked. Against a 24-config corpus covering every shipped provider, 4 block: 3 are unambiguous credential-exfil / sensitive-path refusals and 1 (`rm -rf /tmp/scratch/*`) is a plausible cleanup command that is ALREADY refused at the other two seams and by the agent's own bash tool, which shares `BUILTIN_DENIED_COMMAND_PATTERNS`. So this adds no new policy; it removes the one seam that was exempt from the existing one. `git push` and `rm -rf ~...` are the two patterns most likely to bite a real sync/cleanup cron.

**Done when:** `_fire_store_trigger` calls `enforce_action` before `provider.execute` and a blocked decision short-circuits without executing; the refusal is observable (`enforce_action`'s SEL row + needs_human notification, plus a `skipped_gate` Runs-history row naming the matched rule — never `failed`, which would autopause the automation after five blocks); a test drives a REAL trigger fire and asserts the provider was never reached plus the allowed inverse; `session_key` is threaded so the run's `SafetyProfile.denylist_extra`/`path_allowlist` layer as at the other two seams; the chokepoint rail asserts all three execution seams carry the denylist so a fourth seam or another retirement cannot silently drop it again — DONE 2026-08-13 (18921 passed + 3 pre-existing worktree-only harness_validate failures; 15 new tests)

### `AG-13` — Consolidate the fourteen autonomy knobs into one declarative policy (shared with SupervisorPolicy)

**Status:** done

"How much freedom does this work have" is answered in fourteen places with no composition rule: `RunBudget`, `runtime_hints.execution.single_active_feature`, `require_hitl`, `gate_policy`'s risk-scoped auto-approval, the `confirmation` matrix plus per-stage mute, `autonomy.py`'s risk registry / floors / earned trust, `allowed_write_paths`, the `resilience` breaker config, `escalation_cfg.ladder`, loop `trust_ttl_secs`, loop `attended`, `max_cycles`, `idle_secs`, and `SafetyProfile`. You cannot answer what a given run is allowed to do without reading all fourteen. Three independent sources in the loop-engineering literature converge on the same requirement — risk-calibrated autonomy, trust graduated by leverage, and the ruling that the high-leverage decisions never leave — and all three need autonomy readable in ONE place to be tunable at all. The mechanism is already designed: PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5's two-level `Ceiling ∩ Profile` with tightest-wins archetype dispatch. Depends on `PP-14` so this and `SupervisorPolicy` are ONE object rather than two competing declarations.

**Done when:** One declarative policy composes the fourteen knobs tightest-wins under the `Ceiling ∩ Profile` model, and it is the SAME object `PP-14` declares — a run's supervisor policy and its autonomy ceiling are one declaration, not two. Every existing knob keeps its current effective value for every shipped template and bundled loop kind: a table maps each of the fourteen to its policy field and a test asserts the composed answer equals today's answer for a matrix of runs, so this is a consolidation and not a behaviour change. The path-matcher rule PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §5 lifted verbatim applies here (never `normpath` a PATTERN — `/a/**/../b` collapses to `/a/b` and silently widens an allow). `AG-11`'s deferred profile/trust behaviours are re-pointed at the consolidated object rather than executed twice.
