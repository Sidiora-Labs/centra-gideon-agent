# AGENT-PACKS — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`AGENT-PACKS`](../plans/AGENT-PACKS.md)  
**Code:** `AP`  
**Source status:** proposed



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

## Atom scopes

### `AP-1` — Pack format + export core (dependency-closure walker + two-layer redaction)

**Status:** todo

§1 The .gideon Pack Format; §2.1 Dependency-closure walker; §2.2 Deny-list secret redaction. Session 1. Soft: reads WORKFLOWS-V2 template store via per-kind adapter reading whichever shape exists on disk.

**Done when:** build_pack(seeds) writes a schema_version=1 .gideon ZIP: the §2.1 edge table resolves declared references with unresolvable edges demoted to requirements rows; structural layer (shared packs/deny.py, extends portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE) never opens .env/.local_secret/memory.db/knowledge.db/sessions; content layer (security.redact + guardrails scan wrapper) BLOCKS any credential-bearing component; export preview tree renders before writing; golden-pack fixture round-trip greps clean of planted canary secrets.

### `AP-2` — Import core: inspect-without-write, leaves-first commit, rollback, ref-integrity lint, scan

**Status:** todo

§3.1 Pipeline; §3.2 Referential-integrity linter; §3.5 Trust scan-everything-tier-by-origin; §8 skills path (PackMarketplace→install_guarded). Session 2. Success criteria 2, 3.

**Done when:** import runs inspect (dry-run, no writes) then quarantine→integrity recompute→packs/lint.py ref-integrity lint→leaves-first commit with per-write journal at packs/.installing/<id>.json; a DANGEROUS-pattern skill is refused regardless of consent and WARNING needs explicit consent; fault-injected mid-import unwinds every journaled write to byte-identical pre-import state; skills commit through PackMarketplace→install_guarded producing .gideon-lock.json; fresh-id rewriting on parsed objects (never raw bytes); triggers land disabled and config_subset staged; every step SEL-audited.

### `AP-3` — Requirements resolution + connector catalog (configure/substitute/skip) + setup-skill + PacksConfig

**Status:** todo

§3.3 Connector catalog + configure-or-substitute; §3.4 Post-install setup-skill interview; §8 four config wiring points; §9 stores. Session 3. Soft: re-satisfies against WORK-R19 secrets store when present, save_credential fallback until then.

**Done when:** connector_catalog.json store seeded; each connectors.json declaration resolves via configure (credential collected, server written through providers/mcp_instances)/substitute (same-category rewrite)/skip; skipped deps degrade with machine-readable connector_missing:<name>; setup/SKILL.md installs through the guarded path and surfaces as a re-runnable Finish-setup chip; new PacksConfig (skill_catalogs, fingerprint_enabled, connector_catalog_url) wired through dataclass _meta, load(), to_dict(), _EDITABLE_CONFIG+FE with test_config_roundtrip green.

### `AP-4` — Pack kinds: agent/roster packs, prompt-card importer, bundled Domain OS packs, one-link serialization

**Status:** done

§4.1 Domain OS packs; §4.2 Agent/roster packs; §4.3 Prompt-card importer; §4.4 / §2.3 One-link setup export. Session 4. Success criteria 1, 4. Soft: WORK-R16 roster slug refs, LEARNING-FLYWHEEL {source,computedHash} locks.

**Done when:** Personal CFO + Health OS bundled first-party packs export→wipe→import on a fresh GIDEON_HOME with skills locked, template runnable, digest trigger DISABLED, connector configure-or-substitute prompt, and setup interview binding a folder; roster pack imports rendering persona markdown into config agents{} with every runbook/catalog slug lint-resolved (a broken slug blocks import naming the exact unresolved ref) and only the always tier one-click-deploys; prompt-card importer fences pasted input, maps to typed PromptTemplate/WorkflowDef/AgentDefinition through the proposal review flow; one-link JSON serialization imports through the same §3 pipeline.

**DONE.** Four sub-scopes, four modules, all four clauses met and driven through a real gateway.

`packs/bundled/` ships **Personal CFO** and **Health OS** as authored SOURCE trees (the
`workflows/bundled` convention) with `build_bundled()` assembling a `.gideon` on demand. The
author declares `components` edges; the builder derives every `sha256` + `content_hash` using
AP-1's own derivation and runs AP-1's `_scan_component` content layer over every member — so
one derivation produces the archive an importer verifies, not two. It fails closed in BOTH
directions: a declared component with no file, and a component-shaped file no manifest row
claims (a silent drop would make integrity recompute disagree with the pack's own contents).

`packs/roster.py` owns §4.2. `agents/catalog.json` + `agents/runbooks/*.json` are members that
DESCRIBE components, so they lint against the agent components actually carried: an unresolved
slug or an unrecognised activation tier is a lint ERROR, which AP-2's existing gate turns into a
refusal before any write. The refusal message now carries each finding's **detail** (was
`code:ref` only) because the exact unresolved ref lives only there — the done_when's "naming the
exact unresolved ref" was not true of the message a user reads until this changed. The roster
stages at `packs/staged/<pack>/roster.json` carrying FRESH committed ids; `deploy_roster()`
promotes ONLY the `always` tier into `config.json agents{}` as an `AgentProfile` with the
persona's prompt/voice/model/skills, which is the seam `resolve_bindings` reads.

`packs/prompt_cards.py` owns §4.3: `fence_untrusted` (guarded by `security.is_fenced`, never a
substring test) → `one_shot_completion(use_case="background", output_type=dict)` → exactly one of
`PromptTemplate` / a `WorkflowDef` spec (`validate_spec(strict=True)`) / `AgentDefinition` →
`learning.proposals.enqueue`. Two new `Kind` members (`PROMPT`, `AGENT`) with an import-time
label-totality guard; the installer claims by TAG (`prompt-card`), not kind, because three other
producers already file `template` proposals. `packs/onelink.py` owns §2.3/§4.4 as a
serialization, not a second importer: `materialize()` re-hashes every resource and refuses the
whole document on one mismatch, then hands the archive to `import_pack` unchanged.

Two deliberate calls, both recorded as DEVIATIONs in the plan's execution log: (1) the round
trip's "export" leg is `build_bundled` from the authored tree, because AP-1's `build_pack` reads
only skill/template/prompt/agent stores and a live-store trigger/connector exporter is nobody's
declared scope (AP-7 owns the full validation sweep); (2) the persona reaches `config.json
agents{}` on DEPLOY, not on import — writing it at import would make every staged tier live,
contradicting the same clause's "only the always tier one-click-deploys".

### `AP-5` — Outbound multi-tool export (ExternalFormat + 3 renderers + byte-identical golden tests)

**Status:** done

§5 Multi-Tool OUTBOUND Export (amendment c). Session 5 (first half). Success criterion 6. Reuses §2.2 content-layer redaction.

**Done when:** packs/external_formats.py ExternalFormat(name,installKind,dest,render) contract + Claude Code agents / Cursor rules / SKILL.md renderers export a Gideon agent into a ~/.claude/agents/<slug>.md that Claude Code actually loads; a per-format golden-file test proves byte-identical rendering across runs; §2.2 content redaction runs on rendered output; export lands in a user-chosen directory only after explicit dest confirmation.

**DONE.** `packs/external_formats.py` ships the `ExternalFormat(name, installKind, dest, render)`
contract, the three v1 renderers (`claude-code-agents` per-agent, `cursor-rules` roster,
`skill-md` plugin) and an all-or-nothing writer: render → containment-check every path → §2.2
scan → clobber-check → write. Redaction imports `packs.build._scan_component` rather than
forking it, so the content rules stay shared; a hit blocks the whole batch before any file
exists. Containment is checked twice (slug validation in the renderer, resolved-path
validation in the writer) and a file we did not write — recognised by a constant provenance
trailer — is never overwritten. `tests/fixtures/external_formats_golden/` pins per-format
bytes; `tests/test_packs_external_formats.py` renders twice per format and diffs the golden.

Two deliberate calls. (1) The exported agent frontmatter carries `name`/`description`
(+ `model` when pinned) but NOT `tools`: an `AgentDefinition` has no tool-allowlist field, so
any value there would be invented data that silently narrows the exported agent — declared
skills go in the body instead, where an unknown key cannot break the recipient's parse.
(2) No HTTP route or CLI yet — the pack store/detail FE is `AP-7`'s scope; the registry's
readers today are `get_format`/`export_entities` plus the `gideon.packs` package export.
Format conformance is asserted by parsing the rendered frontmatter with a real YAML loader;
**no external binary was executed**.

### `AP-6` — Inbound skill-catalog importer (CatalogMarketplace via install_guarded chokepoint)

**Status:** done

DONE: `packs/catalog_marketplace.py` — `CatalogMarketplace(SkillsMarketplace)` for both catalog
kinds (`index` JSON endpoint, `tap` repo at `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`), tier hard-coded to
`TrustTier.COMMUNITY` (never config-derived), and `fetch_catalog_text` as the module's ONLY
network primitive — `net.fetch` under `egress_policy_for(CONNECTOR)`. `register_skill_catalogs()`
registers every `packs.skill_catalogs` row as `catalog:<name>` on `get_default_skills_registry`
and is reached from the gateway's `_skill_catalogs_startup` hook; fail-open per catalog (a
nameless/urlless/unreachable one never costs the others), and an empty config registers nothing.
Install flows only through `install_guarded` → quarantine/scan/commit/`.gideon-lock.json`, verified
by `verify_skill_integrity`; a `curl|sh` catalog payload is refused DANGEROUS and never lands.
`/api/skills/search` gained per-source `counts` (computed before the global cap) via
`search_marketplaces_counted`, and the Skills store's source filter now shows them. A 900-entry
index costs one guarded fetch, is memoized, and filters in-process — the agent-facing fan-out
stays capped at `limit`. 15 tests in `tests/test_packs_catalog_marketplace.py`.

§6 INBOUND Skill-Catalog Importer (amendment d, first half); §8 skills path. Session 5 (second half). Success criterion 5. Needs PacksConfig.skill_catalogs.

**Done when:** packs/catalog_marketplace.py CatalogMarketplace(SkillsMarketplace) registers each configured catalog (packs.skill_catalogs) on get_default_skills_registry at COMMUNITY tier; fetch() pulls files via net.fetch under the CONNECTOR egress profile returning SkillDetail so install_guarded does quarantine/scan/commit/lock; installing a catalog skill produces a standard .gideon-lock.json and passes verify_skill_integrity (zero chokepoint bypass); Skills store gains a source filter + per-source counts; a large index browses client-side without entering the agent budget until install.

### `AP-7` — Project-fingerprint auto-surfacing + pack update flow + pack store FE + validation sweep

**Status:** done

**DONE.** `packs/fingerprint.py` is the deterministic scanner (sorted walk → glob match → literal
substring signals inside only the files a glob selected), and every negative property in the
done_when is a mechanism rather than prose. **Zero-LLM** is asserted twice: an AST sweep proves the
module imports no sampling/provider/model seam at all, and a scan with
`guardrails.audit.record_attempt` wired to raise records zero attempts (the module-level
`ModelCallGuard` audit sink every guarded call funnels through). **On-create/on-demand only** is a
typed refusal — `scan_project(reason=...)` accepts exactly `SCAN_REASONS` and raises otherwise, so a
timer would have to invent a reason name and fail — plus a call-site ratchet asserting the only two
callers are `api_pack_proposals` and `_fingerprint_proposals`, scoped to the enclosing FUNCTION (a
file-scoped assertion would have let a scan added to `api_projects_get` pass). **Propose-only:** a
full scan with inspect reports leaves the home unchanged except its own SEL row, which is asserted
positively so "no writes" can't be met by an inspect that stopped auditing.

`packs/update.py` owns §1. Install now stamps a `{source, computedHash, path}` lock per component
(`InstalledPack.component_locks`) plus the installed `pack_owned` patterns; an update re-derives one
digest per component — one algorithm for a file and a directory alike, so a skill and a template
cannot drift into two notions of "changed". Decisions are `overwrite` /
`skip_not_pack_owned` / `skip_drift` / `skip_unverifiable`, and a skipped component KEEPS its
original lock so a drifted copy still reads as drifted next time instead of being retroactively
blessed. Ownership is decided against the patterns the **installed** pack declared, so a new version
cannot widen its own ownership to acquire the right to clobber a file the user lives in.

Three deliberate calls, all recorded as DEVIATIONs in the plan's execution log: the new bundled
`infra-ops` pack carries the §7 Terraform fingerprint (a proposal a user cannot act on is not a
proposal); `_build_plan(in_place=True)` turns OFF fresh-id remapping for updates only (on an update
the colliding entity IS the pack's own previous copy, so remapping would report success while
installing a parallel component); and the propose-only card ships on the pack-store surface
(Settings → Packs), not the project hub.

§7 Project-Fingerprint Auto-Surfacing (amendment d, second half); §1 pack_owned update flow; §9 fingerprint_rejections store; pack store/detail FE. Session 6. Success criteria 7, 8.

**Done when:** packs/fingerprint.py zero-LLM scanner over Project.workspace_dir matches declared fingerprints on project-create and on-demand only; a Terraform-shaped dir surfaces a propose-only pack card with confidence + the §3.1 inspect report; rejecting once is remembered per (project,pack) and never re-nags; packs.fingerprint_enabled=false stops scanning entirely; pack update overwrites only pack_owned components and skips computedHash-drifted user-edited copies with a visible drift note; pack store/detail FE ships and the export→wipe→import round-trip validation sweep on a second GIDEON_HOME passes.
