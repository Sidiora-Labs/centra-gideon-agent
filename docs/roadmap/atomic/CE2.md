# CONTEXT-ECONOMY — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`CONTEXT-ECONOMY`](../plans/CONTEXT-ECONOMY.md)  
**Code:** `CE2`  
**Source status:** done



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

**Done when:** SC#9 met: app-contributed tool provider appears as its own group with zero app-side code, unbound capability group (subagents with no model) never renders + reset_tools refuses it; flag PATCH round-trips + persists; perf regression from unconditional offerability probe found & fixed (probe only when grouping active); log [2026-07-28][S5] DONE, gate green (8243 passed)

### `CE2-6` — Codebase graph: tree-sitter indexer + SQLite store + code_map tools + SDLC planning + @-mention centrality
