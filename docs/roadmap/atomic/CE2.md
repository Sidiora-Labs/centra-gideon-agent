# CONTEXT-ECONOMY — atomic plans

**Source status:** done



Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

### `CE2-7` — Grammar availability is a capability, not an assertion

**Status:** done

**Design.** `codegraph/parse.py` already treated a missing grammar as normal ("False is a normal answer, not an
error"), and `tests/test_codegraph.py` asserted the opposite: `assert parser_available("python") is True`, in a test
named `test_parser_available_is_a_question_not_an_assertion`. On 2026-08-12 that self-contradiction reddened two
unrelated PRs — #1144 with 2 failures and #1162 with 21, every one of them in this file — because a GitHub runner
could not load the python grammar. The grammars are not shipped in the wheels: `tree_sitter_language_pack` fetches
each one into a per-user cache on first use, so a cold cache without network yields no grammar. That is a capability
absence, not a defect, and it must not red a whole suite.

Three moving parts, in order of importance. **(1) The reason is recorded.** `parser_status()` returns
`(language, available, reason)` and `_record_load_failure` logs `"<ExceptionType>: <message>"` once per language —
with the grammar cache path and a fixed remedy — at WARNING for a language the indexer actually asks for and DEBUG
otherwise. Before this, CI reported only the absence, so there was nothing to diagnose from. `parser_available`
keeps its `bool` contract; callers who need the reason ask `parser_status`. **(2) The test posture matches the
product.** The suite probes the capability once at module scope and skips the 35 grammar-dependent tests naming the
recorded reason; the other 37 — every fail-soft path, the path/key math, tool wiring, budget caps — keep running,
which is the property this file exists to assert. The floor that never skips is `test_the_parser_dependency_is_installed`:
the wheels are declared in `pyproject.toml`, so an unimportable package is a packaging regression and stays a hard
red. **(3) No caching.** The language pack already memoizes the loaded grammar (measured: 5.8 ms first load, 0.1 ms
for the next 200), so a local cache would save microseconds while sharing one `Parser` across the gateway's threads,
and a `Parser` is not safe to drive from two threads at once.

**Implementation plan.**
1. `ParserStatus` dataclass + `parser_status()`; keep `parser_available()` as the bool projection.
2. `_record_load_failure()` — idempotent per `(language, reason)`, cleared on a later success, WARNING only for
   `LANGUAGE_BY_SUFFIX` languages so a caller probing an exotic grammar does not spam the log.
3. `PARSER_REMEDY` naming the pre-fetch command, and the grammar cache dir in the warning.
4. `parse_source` names the reason on the per-file path instead of swallowing it.
5. Test file: module-scope probe, `needs_grammar` skipif, 35 marks, the dependency floor, the contract test, and a
   monkeypatched-loader test that the reason is non-empty.
6. Prove both postures: 72/72 with a grammar, 37 passed / 35 skipped / 0 failed with the loader raising.
