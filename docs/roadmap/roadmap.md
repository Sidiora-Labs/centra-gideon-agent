# Gideon Roadmap

Active and planned feature work. Each entry links to a detailed plan document in `plans/`.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-26 · **rev 13** — 62 plans / 6 pillars / ~330 sessions.

- **rev 13** — gap-analysis round 2 (owner Q&A + five approved mechanism designs). Five new plans: **58 Feedback-Signal** (Pillar C — 👍/👎 on AI judgments; 👍 silent-positive-only; capture store + per-producer accuracy + deterministic retire-thresholds; interpretive arm forward-hooked to Learning-Flywheel), **59 Model-Use-Cases-V2** (Pillar D — chat sub-vocabulary grows to background/orchestration/loops + code_tools/reasoning finally exposed; ordered per-use-case fallback chains, breaker-aware; composer override chains on top: override → chain default → fallbacks), **60 Investigate-Anywhere** (Pillar F — one fenced chat-with-context primitive + ~13-surface adoption sweep), **61 Artifacts-Evolution** (Pillar F — artifacts split from Files into a first-class library; store already first-class per recon — surface/dedup/iterate/diffs are the real gaps), **62 Agent-Rooms** (Pillar A — PROPOSED stub, owner-deferred until WORKFLOWS-V2 slices + ACP-AGENT-PARITY; council workflow template named as the cheap precursor). Ten round-2 amendments (`## Amendment (2026-07-26 — gap analysis round 2 …)` blocks): AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS (earned-autonomy rung ladder per action type, ~4→~6), BROWSE-AUTOMATION (a11y-outline compression + live mirror + auth handoff + scheduled actuator, ~4→~5), EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE (lab/gate/field three-loop structure, ~5→~6), AMBIENT-SURFACES (dashboard-as-views w/ Overview + Mission Control presets-first + modern agent-world seam, ~6→~8), INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION (typed Proposal payload + apply contract + app emission, 6→7), ONBOARDING-UX (three-surface split; onboarding walks essential first-party apps FIRST, 4→5), COMPANION-APPS (multi-gateway pairing/switching = the sanctioned multi-instance story; hub explicitly vetoed), CHANNEL-EXPANSION (vendor-completeness pattern, Slack exemplar), AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE (app-contributed trigger sources committed), CHAT-CRAFT (optimizer polish row). Owner rulings recorded: no multi-instance hub ever (remote access = Remote-User-Auth; separation = Companion-Apps switching); presets-first on a composition-ready view registry; 👍 silent-positive-only; composer model override chains rather than failing hard. **Execution-order pass folded in:** the rev-12/13 batch entries in the Wave 2/3 lists carry an explicit in-wave pickup order — contract-owners before consumers (Model-UC-v2 and Feedback-Signal first; Investigate-Anywhere before Artifacts S3; Inbox-Unify's proposals contract before Guardrails' promotion offers), ChatPage-heavy work serialized (Chat-Craft → Agent-Routing → Artifacts' chat touches) so no two plans churn ChatPage concurrently, and Personality-Themes after Fluid-Motion (it rides those dials).
- **rev 12** — sibling-platform gap analysis (MeshClaw/KiroClaw core + website + ~75 apps surveyed 2026-07-26), owner-greenlit batch. Three new plans: **55 Chat-Craft** (Pillar F — seven proven chat-surface mechanics: true rewind, queue interrupt-now, find-in-conversation, quote-reply, follow-up chips, screen-snip, smooth streaming), **56 Agent-Routing** (Pillar D — suggest-first specialist routing chip; deterministic+embedding classification, LLM never in the hot path; silent auto-routing deferred to a future earned-autonomy mechanism), **57 Personality-Themes** (Pillar F — themes that carry behavior: name/logo/sound/flourishes, strictly additive, a11y never weakened). Thirteen dated amendments (each plan carries an `## Amendment (2026-07-26 …)` block): WORKFLOWS-V2 (cached-rerun legibility + per-node inspection, 31→32), PLATFORM-RESILIENCE (`steer` mid-turn policy, 5→6), EXECUTION-ISOLATION (ceiling-everything + spawn-audit test, 7→8), AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE (calendar-aware scheduling: quiet windows + duty gate + week grid, 9→10), INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION (second-opinion verify gate, 5→6), SECURITY-HARDENING (tamper-resistant baseline denylist), LEARNING-VISIBILITY (periodic identity report), MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY (the usage story over the guardrails audit), EXTERNAL-ACCESS (OpenAI-compatible doorway promoted to an early sub-slice), AMBIENT-SURFACES (in-chat widget round-trip formalized — bridge already exists), APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION (app update badges, consented cross-app reads, Fix-with-AI), MOBILE-COMPANION (approve-from-phone reordered to milestone one), DURABILITY-AND-SYNC (merge-restore gaps closed — merge mode already exists).
- **rev 11** — two cross-cutting infrastructure plans added from the owner's remote-access ask: **53 Remote-User-Auth** (Pillar B — human login that mints the existing session token for internet-exposed self-hosting, on a durable-session foundation; the prerequisite for remote companion clients) and **54 Companion-Apps** (Pillar D — the connectivity contract native clients use to reach a local-or-remote gateway: discovery, unified pairing, endpoint switching, auth; MOBILE-COMPANION + DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES consume it). Note verified in the same pass: the desktop shell is **already Electron** — there is no Tauri anywhere, so no migration plan was created; the mic/audio gap is DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES S3 (unbuilt), not a re-platform. v0.1.2 shipped Design-System-Consistency, Platform-Legibility, Autonomy-Guardrails, and Platform-Resilience.
- **rev 10** — Pillar F "Product Depth & Craft" added (48 App-Platform-Evolution, 49 Knowledge-Library, 50 Session-Management, 51 Design-System-Consistency, 52 Fluid-Motion), from the owner's product-depth ask.
- **rev 9** — pre-launch alignment: 17 plans (31-47) added from the pre-launch investigation & owner review under new Pillar E (Launch, Reach & Ecosystem) + additions to B/C/D; PUBLICATION amended (repos under the `Gideon` GitHub org, gideon.dev primary domain, force-push/SOURCE_REV retired → feature-branches-to-`main`); EXTERNAL-ACCESS §3 read-only MCP extracted to plan 41. Deepened plans carry Contracts & Interfaces + executor task tables; see the three companion docs below.
- **rev 4-8** (earlier) — ACP Agent Parity (4), TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES (5), Multi-Tenant rescope (6), grok-build learnings folded into CONTEXT-ECONOMY/EXTERNAL-ACCESS/PLATFORM-RESILIENCE (7), HARNESS-CRAFT (8).

## Program Structure

62 plans across 6 conceptual pillars. Plans interleave via execution waves; the engine carries embedded acceptance criteria from downstream plans. The research corpus lives at `docs/research/learnings/` (14 source-agnostic topic files, ~320 mechanisms) — feed a topic file to any implementation session for mechanism-level grounding.

**Every implementation session executes under [plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md](plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md)** — the standing ground rules (scope discipline, definition of done, validation-as-a-user, deviation ledger, escalation triggers) that let plan tasks be delegated to any session, including smaller models, without eroding standards. Deepened plans carry executor-ready task tables (ID / task / files / done-when); a session that can't tell what "done" means for a task treats that as a defect in the task, not license to improvise.

**Three cross-cutting companion docs:**
- [plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md](plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md) — the standing ground rules every session runs under (above).
- [plans/INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md](plans/INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md) — **how the rev-9 plans fit together**: the build-order/data-flow map, the shared-seam inventory (each contract defined once, referenced everywhere), the mechanical conventions (config wiring, error envelopes, SEL events, storage, fail-open-vs-closed, sdk exports), the verified existing primitives, and the three "landmine" convergence points. Read this before any single plan. Each deepened plan carries a `Contracts & Interfaces` section (exact dataclasses, signatures, JSON schemas, wire contracts) + an `Integration points` list (calls / called-by / storage / gates) so a session — including a smaller model — never invents a shape another plan also touches.
- [plans/REV9-ALIGNMENT-AND-OWNER-TASKS.md](plans/REV9-ALIGNMENT-AND-OWNER-TASKS.md) — binds the original plans 1-30 to the protocol, annotates their rev-9 alignment deltas, and holds the single consolidated **owner-tasks index across all 47 plans** (accounts, spend decisions, credentials, hardware, validations you must drive, copy sign-offs).

**Alignment principles (rev 9, owner-set):**

1. **Clean architecture and implementation state outrank early feature availability.** Applied as: never pull a feature forward onto an unclean seam — the seam work lands first (e.g. sender trust before channels, the kind registry before digest, the lifecycle doctrine before any migration-bearing plan).
2. **The engine program keeps its position.** WORKFLOWS-V2 remains the Wave-1 architecture investment; the launch/reach plans (Pillar E) run in Waves 0-2 alongside it rather than displacing it.
3. **The clean-break doctrine graduates.** Post-publication, migration-bearing changes follow the LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE lifecycle (gate → dual-path → migrate → cleanup); plan 31 lands first in Wave 0 because it shapes how every other plan's changes land.
4. **Zero telemetry is a feature.** No adoption instrumentation is added anywhere in this program; public signals only (stars, PyPI downloads, GitHub traffic).

## Execution Waves

**Wave 0 — Front-runners (no v2 dependency; launch-gating set added in rev 9):**
- **Lifecycle Doctrine (plan 31 — lands FIRST: its doctrine + stability tiers shape how every other plan's changes land)**
- **Publication (plan 27, amended — release under the `Gideon` org; all engineering prerequisites complete):**
  create org + migrate repos, push, tag v0.1.0, post-publication verification against the live remote
- **CI & Release Engineering (plan 33: red-test triage → green main, PR/merge workflows, release pipeline, supply chain)**
- **Distribution (plan 34: wheels with prebuilt web assets, PyPI/uvx, images, bootstrap, self-update generalization)**
- **Security Legibility (plan 35: SECURITY.md, public threat model, honest-limitations)**
- **Discoverability & Launch (plan 36 S1-3: claim org/domain, website + docs site + llms.txt, launch assets)**
- **OSS Operations (plan 37: stated model, hygiene set, DCO, AGENTS.md, community surface, continuity)**
- **Provider-Boundary Completion (plan 32: slack-sdk dep out, doctor/setup extraction, logger-root seam)**

- ACP Agent Parity (full: 3 per-provider validation sweeps → severity-ordered parity fixes)
- Multi-Tenant Entity Readiness (Sessions 1-3)

**Wave 1 — The engine + first reach track (engine unchanged; reach runs alongside):**
- WORKFLOWS-V2 Slices 0-5 (data model + frontier scheduler, engine-owned completion, effect ledger, mutations + checkpoints/fork, chat tools + HTTP/FE + live widget; Self-Verification replay gates the journal format)
- Channel Expansion (Sessions 1-3: sender-trust core seam, then Telegram)
- **Remote User Authentication (plan 53: durable session foundation → owner credential + CLI/deploy bootstrap → login front door → public-exposure hardening — the prerequisite for remote companion clients)**

- Desktop Capabilities (Sessions 1-3: rebuild + signing, capability bridge, live audio)
- Ecosystem Tooling (Sessions 1-2: scaffold + template, registry data tier)
- Platform Reach Track B (Windows rungs 1-2: containers + WSL2; rung-3 audit)
- Learning Visibility (Session 3: refinement arm surfaced)
- **Design-System Consistency (full, ~3: audit → token/primitive hardening → a11y/parity + CI ratchet — run early so later surfaces inherit a clean baseline)**
- **Knowledge Library (Sessions 1-2: collections, curation + taxonomy + bulk)**
- **Session Management (Sessions 1-2: cross-session search, smart organization + bulk + auto-archive)**
- **App Platform Evolution (Sessions 1-2: background/event capabilities, quality bar + native evolution)**
- *The rev-12/13 batch below is listed in deliberate in-wave pickup order — contract-owners and floor multipliers first, then the ChatPage-heavy work serialized (Chat-Craft → Agent-Routing → Artifacts' chat touches) so no two of them churn ChatPage concurrently:*
- **Model Use-Cases v2 (full, ~3: vocabulary + chain resolver, consumer wiring, Settings chains UI — rev 13; floor multiplier: background/loop chores stop burning the flagship chat model, and Model-Routing-Telemetry later learns inside this vocabulary)**
- **Feedback Signal (full, ~3: capture store + SDK, thumbs on core surfaces, deterministic thresholds — rev 13; contract-owner: its records gate Autonomy-Guardrails' earned-autonomy ladder and Evaluation-Substrate's field loop)**
- **Investigate Anywhere (full, ~2: fenced primitive + SDK, adoption sweep — rev 13; contract-owner: Artifacts-Evolution S3 consumes its resolver registry)**
- **Chat Craft (Sessions 1-3: rewind + queue manners, find + quote, chips + smooth streaming — rev 12; the heaviest ChatPage churn of the batch — land it before the other ChatPage touches)**
- **Agent Routing (full, ~2: routing metadata + classifier, suggestion chip + suppression — rev 12; after Feedback-Signal so its routing-pair double-write lands live, and after Chat-Craft's ChatPage churn)**
- **Artifacts Evolution (Sessions 1-2: entity split + store hardening, library surface — rev 13; S3 unblocks the moment Investigate-Anywhere lands)**
- Platform Resilience Session 6 (`steer` mid-turn policy — rev 12 amendment; after the capability-gate recon; independent — slots anywhere in the batch)

**Wave 3 — Substrate unification + intelligence:**
- Automation Substrate (steps 1-9); Learning Flywheel (steps 5-9); Watched Sources (Sessions 6-9); Ambient Surfaces (Sessions 4-6); Memory Graph + Vault (Sessions 4-5); Durability & Sync (Sessions 4-5); Model Routing Telemetry; Platform Resilience Session 4; Multimodal I/O (Sessions 3-5); Evaluation Substrate (Sessions 1-2); Multi-Tenant Entity Readiness (Sessions 4-5)
- External Access (inbound API, capture proxy, A2A — §3 already served by plan 41; inherits its substrate)
- Mobile Companion (Sessions 4-6: wrapper tier, pairing, store packaging)
- Desktop Capabilities (Session 4: presence + additional platforms, gated on Platform Reach)
- Ecosystem Tooling (Sessions 3-4: exemplar apps, bounty program, registry surface)
- Learning Visibility (Session 4: the public benchmark, with Evaluation Substrate)
- **Knowledge Library (Session 3: reading experience, dedup/merge, library home)**
- **Session Management (Session 3: lifecycle, templates, export/share)**
- **App Platform Evolution (Sessions 3-4: app-to-app messaging, richer UI contribution)**
- **Fluid Motion (full, ~3: physics system → liquid morphing primitives → route transitions + budget proof — on the consistency baseline)**
- *Rev-12/13 Wave-3 additions in dependency order — the proposals contract first (three later items emit through it), then its consumers:*
- Inbox/Notifications Unification (Sessions 6-7: second-opinion verify gate — rev 12; proposals contract + app emission — rev 13; **take these early in the wave** — Feedback-Signal retire proposals, Guardrails promotion offers, and app-update notifications all upgrade from `notify()` to the typed contract the moment S7 lands)
- Autonomy Guardrails (Sessions 5-6: earned-autonomy rung ladder — rev 13; after Feedback-Signal S1, ideally after Inbox-Unify S7 so promotion proposals ride the typed contract from birth)
- Ambient Surfaces (Sessions 7-8: dashboard-as-views presets + modern agent-world seam — rev 13; Mission Control after Inbox-Unification S1-2)
- **Chat Craft (Session 4: screen-snip + polish/validation — rev 12; independent tail)**
- **Artifacts Evolution (Session 3: iterate-with-agent + diffs + chat references — rev 13; needs Investigate-Anywhere's resolver registry; sequence its ChatPage touches after Chat-Craft S4)**
- **Personality Themes (full, ~2: personality registry + two first-party proofs — rev 12; after Fluid Motion — it rides those dials)**

**Wave 4 — Capstone + retirements:**
- Loop engine retirement (Loops Evolution Phase 4); Autonudge absorption; v2 Slices 9-11
- Proactive Assistant (triage pipeline + decision journal — its ambient digest slice already landed via plan 42)
- Evaluation Substrate (Sessions 3-6); Agent Packs & Portable Bundles
- **Security Hardening (plan 47: keychain, signed manifests, gate fuzzing, SEL surface, external review)**
- Agent Rooms (plan 62 — PROPOSED; un-defer only after WORKFLOWS-V2 core slices + ACP-AGENT-PARITY land; council workflow template front-runs it as a LOOPS-EVOLUTION library candidate)

## Boundary Note: Memory vs Knowledge

- **Knowledge** = the user's personal items — documents, files, photos, notes, ingested URLs; `knowledge.db`; future providers (Google Drive, Google Photos) plug in via `KnowledgeProvider` ABC. Plans: KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS, WATCHED-SOURCES, PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT (decision journal items).
- **Memory** = the harness's internal mechanics — facts/facets/episodic/procedural/lessons about the user; `memory.db` (cwd-partitioned); the learning lifecycle belongs here. Plans: LEARNING-FLYWHEEL, MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT, PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT (approval patterns).

## Boundary Note: Inbox vs Notifications (rev 9)

- **Inbox** = THE durable attention store: externally-arriving items AND standing agent requests (proposals, needs-input), typed by (source, kind), with lifecycle and dedup. Plan 42 unifies the surfaces (skills proposals, flywheel proposal queue → inbox kinds).
- **Notifications** = the ephemeral, per-(source, kind)-configurable delivery layer over inbox items and transient events — `DashboardState.notify()` stays the single choke point; rules decide never/badge/immediate/digest and targets (dashboard, channel DM, push). Unread counts derive from inbox lifecycle only.

## Research Library

The 95-source competitive-research corpus has been distilled into a source-agnostic learnings library at `docs/research/learnings/` (14 topic files, ~320 mechanisms). Per-source originals have been retired — all durable content lives in the topic files; all roadmap-actionable items are folded into the plans above. See `docs/research/learnings/README.md` for the index and highest-conviction cross-corpus findings. Public republication of curated topics on gideon.dev is planned (DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH Session 5).

Targeted research docs live at `docs/roadmap/research/`:

- `multi-tenancy-entity-audit.md` (2026-07-14) — code-evidence audit of every provider seam and entity store: tenancy-readiness matrix and the harness-side readiness gaps (username identity, contributor attribution, owner-filter on trigger arming, provenance-weighted recall). Grounds plan 29.
- `team-shared-harness-research.md` (2026-07-14) — adversarially-verified internet research on 2025-2026 shared/multi-tenant agentic harnesses (11 unanimous findings). Ecosystem context for plan 29 — the harness implements only the client side of these patterns.
- `acp-agent-parity-audit.md` — native loop vs claude-code/codex/kiro-cli capability matrix. Grounds plan 28.
- The 2026-07-18 pre-launch investigation & owner alignment review grounds plans 31-47 (rev 9): competitive/offering gap analysis (distribution, channels, contribution model, CI, discoverability, platform reach), the inbox/notifications boundary investigation (plan 42), and the provider-boundary residue verification (plan 32).
