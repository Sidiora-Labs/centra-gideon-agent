# Gideon Roadmap

Active and planned feature work. Each entry links to a detailed plan document in `plans/`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-02 · **rev 18** — 70 plans / 6 pillars / ~376 sessions.

## Proposing roadmap changes

This roadmap is **maintainer-owned** — which is a statement about process, not about
openness. Plans encode sequencing decisions and cross-plan contracts, so a plan edited in
isolation tends to break a seam another plan depends on. One person holding the
dependency graph is what keeps that coherent.

**So: propose, don't PR.** Open a thread in
[Discussions → Ideas](https://github.com/Gideon/Gideon/discussions/categories/ideas)
describing the capability and why it matters. The maintainer files or amends the plan,
and you are credited in it. **Pull requests against `docs/roadmap/` are declined on
principle** — not because the idea is unwelcome, but because the plan is the wrong
artifact for a newcomer to write cold.

What *is* directly contributable: implementing an existing plan task (read the
roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) first — it is mandatory for
roadmap work), fixing a
[good-first-issue](https://github.com/Gideon/Gideon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue),
or reporting that a plan's stated premise no longer matches the code (that is an E1
escalation and genuinely valuable — several plans have been re-scoped because of one).

- **rev 18** — **ground-truth reconciliation** pass (2026-09-02). No new plans — this rev trues the dag against what the 2026-09-01/02 merge convergence actually landed (~21 PRs). (a) **EXT-dep audit applied:** 51 readiness-governing external markers audited SATISFIED were removed from non-done atoms (82 governing at audit time; the delta had already self-cleared as atoms flipped done during the drain); 24 markers on the 18-atom KEEP cluster (ecosystem scaffold/bounty/signer cycle, discoverability pipeline, loops ticker/drain, EXTERNAL-ACCESS E4, SECURITY-HARDENING review, DC connect-mode, WORK-R20 container mode, council gate, vcs preset, install one-liner, LV benchmark matrix) retained. `dag` derived block fully resolved: 0 unresolved, 0 dangling. (b) **Verified flips:** PHF-14 (loader.py measured 4358 ≤ 5400 with five extracted siblings and zero re-export shims; the 08-27 NOT-DONE note was stale), DCU-6 (unsupported_platform.refusal wired in both non-macOS drivers, 70 tests), PA-6 (DecisionJournal + calibration strip shipped, 21 vitest) — each re-verified against main at flip time, not taken from the audit. WF2LOO-9 unblocked (its governing markers all satisfied); BA-7/PHF-15 had already flipped during the drain. (c) **Hygiene:** SH-9's missing blocked_reason recorded (owner-gated external-review commissioning); WF2LEA-10's stale owner-ruling marker cleared (atom was already done). (d) **Eight atoms filed from the seven research-draft slices + the owner dossier:** SM-10 (T03 spend-ceiling price-key rail — price-table ids use dots, catalog uses hyphens, 2/10 resolve, ceiling inert), SM-11 (T22 deleted chats persist in FTS), SM-12 (T00 MCP tool-name wire fidelity), CC-9 (T01 thinking-stream broadcast never rendered), KL-18 (T02 retrieval returns neighbor passage text), AG-14 (T05 LoopStopReason enum + wall-clock/cost ceilings), ES-12 (T04 judge verdict answerability), WF2AUT-14 (ratify shipped resume-targets + implement the orphaned substrate scope — dossier recommendation A). **Verify-first spared two stale gaps:** SafetyProfile/egress_policy 'zero non-test callers' is no longer true (18 callers post-#2294), and injection handling exists across the prompt pipeline — neither got an atom. Local-inference arbitration (confirmed unowned) and the TSE shared-knowledge atom (no core plan home; likely apps-repo) are routed to the owner batch as decisions, not filed cold.
- **rev 17** — **engine primitives** pass (2026-08-14). One new plan: **70 Platform-Primitives** (Pillar A), plus four atoms re-homed rather than duplicated. Synthesized from two research passes (graph-structured agent execution; loop engineering) whose twenty findings reduce to one thesis: **the engine's semantics are implemented three times because three primitives were never named — edges, verdicts and policies.** Four measured findings the plan exists to record: (a) **two edge lists that nothing reconciles** — admission reads `needs` only (`tick._visit_parallel`) and `needs` is sibling-scoped by `validator.py:221-230` ("cross-container edges would make the tree a graph"), while `{{nodes.x.output}}` is a separate graph feeding the cache key, the stale-inputs check and the mutation cascade but never admission, so a `parallel` child binding a sibling without declaring `needs` is admitted concurrently and dies as a `USER` failure naming a node id that is *correct*; none of the 46 shipped `WF_*` codes covers it, and `_kahn_levels` already builds the combined graph while its own docstring says its levels are not an execution order. (b) **Four schedulers answering "what may run now" with zero shared code** — `workflows/tick.frontier()` (lanes/WIP), `loop/tick.evaluate()` (dwell/metric/rollback, consumed by exactly ONE kind), `pool.py`'s `frontier`/`next` (verified: imports only stdlib), `triggers/` `tick_once` — each holding a capability the others cannot express (leases only in the pool, dwell only in loops, lanes only in workflows); arXiv:2604.11378's framing (an agent loop is a "single ready unit scheduler"; graph engines differ in degree, not kind) is what makes the unification semantically available. (c) **The ledger is scoped to one feature** — `learning/mining.py` derives from "the run's own journal", and `learning/` has ZERO references to `loop.store`/`get_findings`, so the outer improvement loop covers one of four work-unit kinds while the five loop kinds carry the long-horizon autonomous work. (d) **`REPLAN` is a declared strategy with a borrowed executor** — `judge_contract.py:128` declares it as "mid-flight replanning instead of ad-hoc mutation" and `engine.py:370-379` implements it as `FAILED` + `TRANSIENT` + a remediation string; nothing re-derives the remaining steps, and `loop/tick`'s `Action` has no replan member at all, while `mutations.py` already ships the machinery. **Re-homed, not duplicated** (checked against all 69 plans / 620 atoms first): the third verdict vocabulary → `WF2LOO-16` (`WF2LOO-12`'s design already *named* `loop/judge.CycleVerdict` as a third dialect and left it unowned; each side is missing what the other has — `marginal_value`/`regressed` are the product's only diminishing-returns signals, the contract side has the proof precondition and the ratchet); loop judge model independence → `WF2LOO-17` (`assess_cycle`'s docstring claims it resolves the `reasoning` use case "a stronger third-party check than the worker's model" while the code resolves `"loops"`, which `provider_bridge.py:343` documents as *the worker's* use case — the correlated-reviewer failure mode, fixable with one config field); the worker-authored stall signal → `WF2LOO-18` (`check_stagnation` reads `new_findings_count`, which the worker writes and which defaults to `1` when absent, so a worker reporting any nonzero count is immune to stagnation detection forever); autonomy's fourteen knobs → `AG-13`, depending on `PP-14` so the autonomy ceiling and the supervisor policy are ONE object. **Deliberately excluded, recorded so they are not mistaken for unbuilt ideas:** folding `triggers/` into the admission core (it answers whether to *start*; merging would put wall-clock into a core whose purity is what makes rewind work), turning the ledger into a database, collapsing the cost-aware `stage`/`infer`/`transform`/`action` split, generating a compiled orchestrator (would kill mid-flight mutation — take the inference, leave the codegen), a worker/trigger/function substrate, and a bi-temporal context graph. **Timing is the owner decision:** `PP-4`/`PP-5`/`PP-9`/`PP-16` are state-shape (class B) changes and each is a plain clean break today. `CONTRIBUTING.md` §"The lifecycle mental model" defers the migration-backed regime *"until the architecture stops moving, on the way to 1.0"*, after which the same change costs gate→dual-path→migrate→cleanup. **Premise correction recorded while filing this rev:** earlier drafts of this entry (and the plan) said "once Lifecycle-Doctrine lands", which is wrong — `LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE.md` was **deleted** as a plan in #897 ("deliverables-only DAG", which removed four non-deliverable docs and folded their guidance into `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`AGENTS.md`), so there is no plan to wait for and no milestone that will announce the boundary. The window is *self-closing rather than scheduled*, which makes the four atoms strictly more expensive the later they land. Three workspace docs still cite the deleted `EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md`/`INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md` paths; corrected in the workspace copies alongside this rev.
- **rev 16** — **product/UX** pass (2026-08-05). Companion to rev 15's hardening pass. **Two new plans: 68 Product-Experience-Parity** (Pillar F) and **69 Desktop-Computer-Use** (Pillar B). Plan 68 is a triage-and-route plan: (§1) **preset-first empty states** — a preset-first schedule surface opens on four prefilled preset cards + a mode-segmented form that hides cron unless chosen, where our `TriggerCreatePage` front-loads the full ontology (~15 events, 7 dormant); a reusable `PresetEmptyState` primitive applied to Triggers/Schedule → Workflows → Tasks → Knowledge, **presets seed the unchanged expert form so power is never removed**. (§2) **App Store right rail** — a persistent `CategoryRail` (categories+counts and sources+provenance always visible) vs our dropdown `FilterMenu`+popover; move both into an always-open-on-wide right rail + art-forward card polish (renders APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION's `quality` badges, doesn't duplicate them). (§3) **Onboarding import** — there is no onboarding-import path today; ONBOARDING-UX has no import row → new scanner framework, Claude Code + Codex first, consent+review+redaction, secrets counted-and-skipped. (§4) **Artifact folders** — an opaque-`folder_id`-never-a-path model (rename-safe), we have none. (§5) **Artifact LOCAL deploy** — owner delta from a BYO-AWS `deploy/` model: a `webapp` artifact served through our own gateway route with strict CSP fencing (app-backend hosting + sandboxed-iframe seams already exist); public exposure deferred to EXTERNAL-ACCESS, **not** a cloud provisioner. (§6) **Artifacts as a knowledge source** — port `knowledge/artifact_ingest.py`'s exact mechanism: one aggregate `artifact://` source row, in-process change-listener (no polling), backfill tied to row-creation, one `FileReader` path; searchable but **not listed as knowledge items**. (§7) **First-party app suite** — ~11 comparable apps vs our ~4; a phased program (Code-Review → Research-Lab → Design-Critique → Docs/Slides → Notes → Issue-Radar → Spec-Builder → Ops → Companion), one PR each, these ARE the ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING exemplars, reusing DOCUMENT-HANDLING-TOOLS/WORKFLOWS-V2/minutes rather than rebuilding. (§8) **steering assessed as ~90% already covered** — `always: true` skills + `project_context.py` ARE our always-on layer; add only a legibility *viewer*, not a parallel concept; plus the missing domain-craft skills. **Re-homed, not duplicated:** channels → CHANNEL-EXPANSION amendment (a shared `TurnDriver` centralizes redaction+approval once; Teams/Webex/WeCom/WeChat are cheap on it; a 21k-LOC Slack app's enterprise/interaction/retry modules are a hardening read); distribution → DISTRIBUTION S5 follow-on (signed channel feed — reconciles with rev 15 §7.2's channel deferral; we already have OIDC provenance). **Plan 69 Desktop-Computer-Use** is genuinely new capability — BROWSE-AUTOMATION is browser-only (grep-verified, zero desktop-automation hits across 67 plans); adopts an accessibility-tree / element-index `AXPress` approach (safer + more reliable than screenshot-and-coordinate; pointer never moves by accident) with the keystone-out-of-band-enable safety floor, hard-gated on AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS + the rev-15 ceilinged-spawn.
- **rev 15** — hardening pass (2026-08-04). **One new plan: 67 Platform-Hardening-Floors** (Pillar B) — deliberately a *re-homing* plan: nine of twelve studied items already had owners, so it corrects and completes them rather than duplicating. **Two premise corrections it exists to record:** (a) EXECUTION-ISOLATION's `EI-A1` specifies `preexec_fn` for resource ceilings and justifies it as "fork-safe because every seam spawns from the single-threaded-at-fork asyncio path" — **false**: core has 67 thread-creation sites, `apps/backend_runtime.py:288` respawns backends from a daemon thread, and `action_providers/bash_provider.py:216` spawns on the event loop thread, so executing that row as written would introduce a gateway-wedge hazard (a child wedged pre-`exec` blocks `Popen._execute_child` in an uninterruptible `os.read` on the loop thread and keeps duplicates of `gateway.lock` + the listening socket); the fix is post-`exec` delivery via a shim plus a four-profile split (`tool`/`session_host`/`build`/`none` — `session_host` exists because a uniform NOFILE cap broke ACP sessions) and a `preexec_fn` AST tripwire. (b) The app-platform trust boundary is **one-directional**: the outbound half is real (`app-platform.md:76` strips the owner credential, injects an app-scoped token), but inbound is unauthenticated — `apps/backend_runtime.py:251` binds loopback with no signature check, so any local process bypasses the proxy, session auth, and `app_permission_middleware`. Also newly owned: a generated+committed `config-baseline.json` (drift, which `test_config_roundtrip.py` cannot see) and an `inert-surface-baseline.json` shrink-only counter aimed at the recurring declared-but-unread defect class; an offline **fake-model E2E harness** that is precisely the "seeded authenticated per-route CI harness" DESIGN-SYSTEM-CONSISTENCY recorded as its deferred a11y tail; a `docs-lint` gate; and the two long-standing xdist flakes' **root causes** (the subagent one is a security-audit gap — a swallowed `except` around a SEL write). Design input re-homed to AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS `S5.2`: `SafetyProfile` (already recorded there as having zero non-test callers) gains the two-level **ceiling ∩ profile** model with archetype dispatch, plus their path-matcher rule lifted verbatim as a test (never `normpath` a *pattern* — `/a/**/../b` → `/a/b` silently drops the `**` and widens an allow). **Excluded by ruling, recorded so they are not mistaken for unbuilt ideas:** a default-on telemetry beacon (the zero-tracking posture is the better promise), a cloud launcher, a gateway-federation hub (already a permanent veto), and i18n catalogs. Telegram needs **no plan change** — CHANNEL-EXPANSION `S2-3` already specs it correctly; the seven-channel breadth is a sequencing argument only. Release channels **deferred, not dropped** (we already have OIDC build-provenance, stronger than a `SHA256SUMS` file; the gap is only the nightly-channel concept).
- **rev 14** — capability gap analysis (researched 2026-07-28/29: four research tracks + two owner-supplied deep-research reports + a code-verified capability audit), owner-triaged item by item. **Four new plans:** **63 Prompt-Cache-Substrate** (Pillar D — verified finding: `model_pricing.json` prices `cache_read`/`cache_write` for 26 models and `LLMEvent` accumulates both, but **zero `cache_control` markers exist in core or any of 40 apps**; one provider-agnostic middleware seam + the one deliberate prefix-stability fix — `context.py:773`'s minute-precision `[CURRENT DATE]` sits at position 2 of every assembled prefix, the canonical cache killer), **64 Cost-and-Token-Observability** (Pillar D — `Stats.get_cost_usd()` has zero consumers, `Stats` is in-memory and lost on restart, `SystemAgentStats.input_tokens` is typed in the FE and rendered by nothing, and subagents discard the completion event's numbers at `subagent.py:1684`; a durable per-turn ledger + three surfaces, observation-only with `SpendMeter` keeping all enforcement), **65 Document-Handling-Tools** (Pillar D — the most visible capability gap: `python-docx`/`openpyxl`/`python-pptx`/`pdfplumber` are all already core deps used **read-only**; one writer seam + docx/xlsx/pptx/pdf/csv generation into the existing artifact store), **66 Email-Inbox-and-Triggers** (Pillar D — no mail anywhere and data-event triggers are memory-only with `vector_memory` as sole emitter; generalize the event vocabulary, add a mail inbox-provider app, then a prompt-bound-address mechanism, allowlist-first and fail-closed). **Seven dated amendments** (`## Amendment (2026-07-29 …)` blocks): BROWSE-AUTOMATION (the local-browser advantage — an extension approach reaches where our gateway already runs; a second execution target behind per-task grants, with the Amazon-v-Perplexity framing constraint written in), WORKFLOWS-V2-WORK-CONTAINERS (**owner-commissioned topology evidence review** — homogeneous-by-default fan-out, heterogeneity by MODEL not persona, writes single-threaded, no item-count threshold, plus seven blocking audit findings incl. the parent-session injection wall that already bites at 8), EXECUTION-ISOLATION (three app-side confinement compounders + a docs-only correction to land first), WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL (skill resource tier — we already have 2 of 3 disclosure levels; agentic/retroactive skill authoring; approval-gated project-context write-back), CHAT-CRAFT (Branch — reopening S1's explicit non-goal deliberately, over the shipped `chat_fork.py`; plus the plan gate promoted from loop-only to chat), MCP-READONLY-INBOUND (already stateless by design and thus safe from the `2026-07-28` stateless-spec change, but `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is three revisions stale), KNOWLEDGE-LIBRARY (indexing depth — **no chunking**, one vector per item over `content[:1000]`, and a brute-force full-table cosine scan under otherwise-strong RRF+graph+cliff-cut machinery). **Owner rulings recorded:** replay links, persistent always-on compute, distribute-into-peer-products, the two skill-safety mechanisms, and per-vendor model residency all DISCARDED as not fitting the self-hosted personal model; sharing/publishing deferred far-horizon behind a user-declared exposed domain; the two audit bugs filed as issues #94/#95 rather than planned. Owner corrections to the input research were recorded at analysis time (acquisition-status, benchmark-provenance, and fork-lineage caveats) and are not load-bearing on the plans.
- **rev 13** — gap-analysis round 2 (owner Q&A + five approved mechanism designs). Five new plans: **58 Feedback-Signal** (Pillar C — 👍/👎 on AI judgments; 👍 silent-positive-only; capture store + per-producer accuracy + deterministic retire-thresholds; interpretive arm forward-hooked to Learning-Flywheel), **59 Model-Use-Cases-V2** (Pillar D — chat sub-vocabulary grows to background/orchestration/loops + code_tools/reasoning finally exposed; ordered per-use-case fallback chains, breaker-aware; composer override chains on top: override → chain default → fallbacks), **60 Investigate-Anywhere** (Pillar F — one fenced chat-with-context primitive + ~13-surface adoption sweep), **61 Artifacts-Evolution** (Pillar F — artifacts split from Files into a first-class library; store already first-class per recon — surface/dedup/iterate/diffs are the real gaps), **62 Agent-Rooms** (Pillar A — PROPOSED stub, owner-deferred until WORKFLOWS-V2 slices + ACP-AGENT-PARITY; council workflow template named as the cheap precursor). Ten round-2 amendments (`## Amendment (2026-07-26 — gap analysis round 2 …)` blocks): AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS (earned-autonomy rung ladder per action type, ~4→~6), BROWSE-AUTOMATION (a11y-outline compression + live mirror + auth handoff + scheduled actuator, ~4→~5), EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE (lab/gate/field three-loop structure, ~5→~6), AMBIENT-SURFACES (dashboard-as-views w/ Overview + Mission Control presets-first + modern agent-world seam, ~6→~8), INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION (typed Proposal payload + apply contract + app emission, 6→7), ONBOARDING-UX (three-surface split; onboarding walks essential first-party apps FIRST, 4→5), COMPANION-APPS (multi-gateway pairing/switching = the sanctioned multi-instance story; hub explicitly vetoed), CHANNEL-EXPANSION (vendor-completeness pattern, Slack exemplar), AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE (app-contributed trigger sources committed), CHAT-CRAFT (optimizer polish row). Owner rulings recorded: no multi-instance hub ever (remote access = Remote-User-Auth; separation = Companion-Apps switching); presets-first on a composition-ready view registry; 👍 silent-positive-only; composer model override chains rather than failing hard. **Execution-order pass folded in:** the rev-12/13 batch entries in the Wave 2/3 lists carry an explicit in-wave pickup order — contract-owners before consumers (Model-UC-v2 and Feedback-Signal first; Investigate-Anywhere before Artifacts S3; Inbox-Unify's proposals contract before Guardrails' promotion offers), ChatPage-heavy work serialized (Chat-Craft → Agent-Routing → Artifacts' chat touches) so no two plans churn ChatPage concurrently, and Personality-Themes after Fluid-Motion (it rides those dials).
- **rev 12** — platform gap analysis (~75 apps surveyed 2026-07-26), owner-greenlit batch. Three new plans: **55 Chat-Craft** (Pillar F — seven proven chat-surface mechanics: true rewind, queue interrupt-now, find-in-conversation, quote-reply, follow-up chips, screen-snip, smooth streaming), **56 Agent-Routing** (Pillar D — suggest-first specialist routing chip; deterministic+embedding classification, LLM never in the hot path; silent auto-routing deferred to a future earned-autonomy mechanism), **57 Personality-Themes** (Pillar F — themes that carry behavior: name/logo/sound/flourishes, strictly additive, a11y never weakened). Thirteen dated amendments (each plan carries an `## Amendment (2026-07-26 …)` block): WORKFLOWS-V2 (cached-rerun legibility + per-node inspection, 31→32), PLATFORM-RESILIENCE (`steer` mid-turn policy, 5→6), EXECUTION-ISOLATION (ceiling-everything + spawn-audit test, 7→8), AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE (calendar-aware scheduling: quiet windows + duty gate + week grid, 9→10), INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION (second-opinion verify gate, 5→6), SECURITY-HARDENING (tamper-resistant baseline denylist), LEARNING-VISIBILITY (periodic identity report), MODEL-ROUTING-TELEMETRY (the usage story over the guardrails audit), EXTERNAL-ACCESS (OpenAI-compatible doorway promoted to an early sub-slice), AMBIENT-SURFACES (in-chat widget round-trip formalized — bridge already exists), APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION (app update badges, consented cross-app reads, Fix-with-AI), MOBILE-COMPANION (approve-from-phone reordered to milestone one), DURABILITY-AND-SYNC (merge-restore gaps closed — merge mode already exists).
- **rev 11** — two cross-cutting infrastructure plans added from the owner's remote-access ask: **53 Remote-User-Auth** (Pillar B — human login that mints the existing session token for internet-exposed self-hosting, on a durable-session foundation; the prerequisite for remote companion clients) and **54 Companion-Apps** (Pillar D — the connectivity contract native clients use to reach a local-or-remote gateway: discovery, unified pairing, endpoint switching, auth; MOBILE-COMPANION + DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES consume it). Note verified in the same pass: the desktop shell is **already Electron** — there is no Tauri anywhere, so no migration plan was created; the mic/audio gap is DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES S3 (unbuilt), not a re-platform. v0.1.2 shipped Design-System-Consistency, Platform-Legibility, Autonomy-Guardrails, and Platform-Resilience.
- **rev 10** — Pillar F "Product Depth & Craft" added (48 App-Platform-Evolution, 49 Knowledge-Library, 50 Session-Management, 51 Design-System-Consistency, 52 Fluid-Motion), from the owner's product-depth ask.
- **rev 9** — pre-launch alignment: 17 plans (31-47) added from the pre-launch investigation & owner review under new Pillar E (Launch, Reach & Ecosystem) + additions to B/C/D; PUBLICATION amended (repos under the `Gideon` GitHub org, gideon.dev primary domain, force-push/SOURCE_REV retired → feature-branches-to-`main`); EXTERNAL-ACCESS §3 read-only MCP extracted to plan 41. Deepened plans carry Contracts & Interfaces + executor task tables; the standing session discipline and shared conventions live in AGENTS.md.
- **rev 4-8** (earlier) — ACP Agent Parity (4), TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES (5), Multi-Tenant rescope (6), grok-build learnings folded into CONTEXT-ECONOMY/EXTERNAL-ACCESS/PLATFORM-RESILIENCE (7), HARNESS-CRAFT (8).

## Program Structure

62 plans across 6 conceptual pillars. Plans interleave via execution waves; the engine carries embedded acceptance criteria from downstream plans. The research corpus lives at `docs/research/learnings/` (14 source-agnostic topic files, ~320 mechanisms) — feed a topic file to any implementation session for mechanism-level grounding.

**Every implementation session executes under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)** — the standing ground rules (scope discipline, definition of done, validation-as-a-user, deviation ledger, escalation triggers) that let plan tasks be delegated to any session, including smaller models, without eroding standards. Deepened plans carry executor-ready task tables (ID / task / files / done-when); a session that can't tell what "done" means for a task treats that as a defect in the task, not license to improvise.

The mechanical conventions a plan builds on — the config round-trip contract, error envelopes, SEL event logging, storage layout, the fail-open-vs-closed rule, and the SDK export boundary — live in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and [docs/architecture/overview.md](../architecture/overview.md); each deepened plan additionally carries a `Contracts & Interfaces` section (exact dataclasses, signatures, JSON schemas, wire contracts) + an `Integration points` list (calls / called-by / storage / gates) so a session — including a smaller model — never invents a shape another plan also touches.

**Alignment principles (rev 9, owner-set):**

1. **Clean architecture and implementation state outrank early feature availability.** Applied as: never pull a feature forward onto an unclean seam — the seam work lands first (e.g. sender trust before channels, the kind registry before digest).
2. **The engine program keeps its position.** WORKFLOWS-V2 remains the Wave-1 architecture investment; the launch/reach plans (Pillar E) run in Waves 0-2 alongside it rather than displacing it.
3. **The clean-break doctrine graduates — later.** During 0.x, migration-bearing (class-B/S) changes ship as plain clean breaks under the pre-1.0 banner (advise `gideon snapshot` in release notes). The migration-backed regime — gate → dual-path → migrate → cleanup — is deferred until the architecture stops moving, on the way to 1.0; the mental model lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes).
4. **Zero telemetry is a feature.** No adoption instrumentation is added anywhere in this program; public signals only (stars, PyPI downloads, GitHub traffic).

## Execution Waves

**Wave 0 — Front-runners (no v2 dependency; launch-gating set added in rev 9):**
- **Publication (plan 27, amended — release under the `Gideon` org; all engineering prerequisites complete):**
  create org + migrate repos, push, tag v0.1.0, post-publication verification against the live remote
- **CI & Release Engineering (plan 33: red-test triage → green main, PR/merge workflows, release pipeline, supply chain)**
- **Distribution (plan 34: wheels with prebuilt web assets, PyPI/uvx, images, bootstrap, self-update generalization)**
- **Security Legibility (plan 35: SECURITY.md, public threat model, honest-limitations)**
- **Discoverability & Launch (plan 36 S1-3: claim org/domain, website + docs site + llms.txt, launch assets)**
- **OSS Operations (plan 37: stated model, hygiene set, DCO, AGENTS.md, GitHub Discussions; the chat server + continuity floor were owner-descoped 2026-07-31 — handled separately)**
- **Provider-Boundary Completion (plan 32: slack-sdk dep out, doctor/setup extraction, logger-root seam)**
- **MCP Read-Only Inbound (plan 41 S1: substrate + mount; S2 lands Wave 0/1)**
- Autonomy Guardrails (full)
- Local Model Manager v2 (full)
- Platform Legibility (Sessions 1-3: manifest, SKILL.md, error envelopes)
- Platform Resilience (Sessions 1-3: doctor probes, degraded contracts, mid-turn handling)
- Context Economy (Sessions 1-4: compression extensions, tool groups, background compaction)
- Memory Graph + Vault (Sessions 1-3: backlinks table, alias graph, vault projection)
- Durability & Sync (Sessions 1-3: snapshot coverage gap, manifest, scheduled backups)
- Self-Verification (Sessions 1-2: spec harness, event-trace replay infrastructure)
- Learning Flywheel (steps 1-4: LearningGate, capture hygiene, proposal queue, lesson migration)
- Universal Planning dead-code deletion (verified dead `context_management.py` plan-mode)
- ACP Agent Parity (full: 3 per-provider validation sweeps → severity-ordered parity fixes)
- Multi-Tenant Entity Readiness (Sessions 1-3)

**Wave 1 — The engine + first reach track (engine unchanged; reach runs alongside):**
- WORKFLOWS-V2 Slices 0-5 (data model + frontier scheduler, engine-owned completion, effect ledger, mutations + checkpoints/fork, chat tools + HTTP/FE + live widget; Self-Verification replay gates the journal format)
- Channel Expansion (Sessions 1-3: sender-trust core seam, then Telegram)
- **Remote User Authentication (plan 53: durable session foundation → owner credential + CLI/deploy bootstrap → login front door → public-exposure hardening — the prerequisite for remote companion clients)**
- Inbox/Notifications Unification (Sessions 1-3: kind registry + rules engine, inbox as the attention store, settings unification) — executed as a maintainer clean break under the pre-1.0 banner (the earlier "first full lifecycle exercise" framing described a methodology, not a dependency; corrected 2026-07-30)
- Learning Visibility (Sessions 1-2: end-to-end visible slice, "What I learned" surfaces)
- Onboarding UX (Sessions 1-2: guided first run, progressive disclosure)
- Platform Reach Track A (ARM: arm64 CI + SQLite-fallback verification, multi-arch release-blocking)
- Discoverability & Launch (Sessions 4-5: comparison pages, listings program, research-library publication path)
- MCP Read-Only Inbound (Session 2 if not landed in Wave 0)

**Wave 2 — Convergence (parallel tracks once Slices 0-2 land):**
- Track A: Loops Evolution → Universal Planning
- Track B: Knowledge Synthesis
- Track C: v2 Slices 6-8 interleaved with Work-Containers
- Track D: Tasks & SOPs
- Track E: Watched Sources (Sessions 1-5)
- Track F: Ambient Surfaces (Sessions 1-3)
- Execution Isolation; Browse Automation; Self-Verification Session 3; Multimodal I/O (Sessions 1-2); Platform Legibility (Sessions 4-5); Harness Craft
- Channel Expansion (Sessions 4-8: Discord, email, channel-author ramp)
- Inbox/Notifications Unification (Sessions 4-5: proposal-surface fold-in, digest + cleanup)
- Onboarding UX (Sessions 3-4: approval-brief polish, stranger validation)
- **Companion Apps (plan 54: connectivity contract + Devices registry, LAN discovery, endpoint switching, native-wrapper coordination — MOBILE-COMPANION + DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES consume it; after Remote-User-Auth S1)**
- Mobile Companion (Sessions 1-3: remote-access story, PWA companion view, web push)
- Desktop Capabilities (Sessions 1-3: rebuild + signing, capability bridge, live audio)
- Ecosystem Tooling (Sessions 1-2: scaffold + template, registry data tier)
- Platform Reach Track B (Windows rungs 1-2: containers + WSL2; rung-3 audit)
- Learning Visibility (Session 3: refinement arm surfaced)
- **Design-System Consistency (full, ~3: audit → token/primitive hardening → a11y/parity + CI ratchet — run early so later surfaces inherit a clean baseline)**
- **Knowledge Library (Sessions 1-2: collections, curation + taxonomy + bulk)**
- **Session Management (Sessions 1-2: cross-session search, smart organization + bulk + auto-archive)**
- **App Platform Evolution (Sessions 1-2: background/event capabilities, quality bar + native evolution)**
- *The rev-12/13 batch below is listed in deliberate in-wave pickup order — contract-owners and floor multipliers first, then the ChatPage-heavy work serialized (Chat-Craft → Agent-Routing → Artifacts' chat touches) so no two of them churn ChatPage concurrently:*
- **Model Use-Cases v2 (full, ~3: vocabulary + chain resolver, consumer wiring, Settings chains UI — rev 13; floor multiplier: background/loop chores stop burning the flagship chat model, and Model-Routing-Telemetry later learns inside this vocabulary)**
- **Feedback Signal (full, ~3: capture store + SDK, thumbs on core surfaces, deterministic thresholds — rev 13; contract-owner: its records gate Autonomy-Guardrails' earned-autonomy ladder and Evaluation-Substrate's field loop)**
- **Investigate Anywhere (full, ~2: fenced primitive + SDK, adoption sweep — rev 13; contract-owner: Artifacts-Evolution S3 consumes its resolver registry)**
- **Chat Craft (Sessions 1-3: rewind + queue manners, find + quote, chips + smooth streaming — rev 12; the heaviest ChatPage churn of the batch — land it before the other ChatPage touches)**
- **Agent Routing (full, ~2: routing metadata + classifier, suggestion chip + suppression — rev 12; after Feedback-Signal so its routing-pair double-write lands live, and after Chat-Craft's ChatPage churn)**
- **Artifacts Evolution (Sessions 1-2: entity split + store hardening, library surface — rev 13; S3 unblocks the moment Investigate-Anywhere lands)**
- Platform Resilience Session 6 (`steer` mid-turn policy — rev 12 amendment; after the capability-gate recon; independent — slots anywhere in the batch)

**Wave 3 — Substrate unification + intelligence:**
- Automation Substrate (steps 1-9); Learning Flywheel (steps 5-9); Watched Sources (Sessions 6-9); Ambient Surfaces (Sessions 4-6); Memory Graph + Vault (Sessions 4-5); Durability & Sync (Sessions 4-5); Model Routing Telemetry; Platform Resilience Session 4; Multimodal I/O (Sessions 3-5); Evaluation Substrate (Sessions 1-2); Multi-Tenant Entity Readiness (Sessions 4-5)
- External Access (inbound API, capture proxy, A2A — §3 already served by plan 41; inherits its substrate)
- Mobile Companion (Sessions 4-6: wrapper tier, pairing, store packaging)
- Desktop Capabilities (Session 4: presence + additional platforms, gated on Platform Reach)
- Ecosystem Tooling (Sessions 3-4: exemplar apps, bounty program, registry surface)
- Learning Visibility (Session 4: the public benchmark, with Evaluation Substrate)
- **Knowledge Library (Session 3: reading experience, dedup/merge, library home)**
- **Session Management (Session 3: lifecycle, templates, export/share)**
- **App Platform Evolution (Sessions 3-4: app-to-app messaging, richer UI contribution)**
- **Fluid Motion (full, ~3: physics system → liquid morphing primitives → route transitions + budget proof — on the consistency baseline)**
- *Rev-12/13 Wave-3 additions in dependency order — the proposals contract first (three later items emit through it), then its consumers:*
- Inbox/Notifications Unification (Sessions 6-7: second-opinion verify gate — rev 12; proposals contract + app emission — rev 13; **take these early in the wave** — Feedback-Signal retire proposals, Guardrails promotion offers, and app-update notifications all upgrade from `notify()` to the typed contract the moment S7 lands)
- Autonomy Guardrails (Sessions 5-6: earned-autonomy rung ladder — rev 13; after Feedback-Signal S1, ideally after Inbox-Unify S7 so promotion proposals ride the typed contract from birth)
- Ambient Surfaces (Sessions 7-8: dashboard-as-views presets + modern agent-world seam — rev 13; Mission Control after Inbox-Unification S1-2)
- **Chat Craft (Session 4: screen-snip + polish/validation — rev 12; independent tail)**
- **Artifacts Evolution (Session 3: iterate-with-agent + diffs + chat references — rev 13; needs Investigate-Anywhere's resolver registry; sequence its ChatPage touches after Chat-Craft S4)**
- **Personality Themes (full, ~2: personality registry + two first-party proofs — rev 12; after Fluid Motion — it rides those dials)**

**Wave 4 — Capstone + retirements:**
- Loop engine retirement (Loops Evolution Phase 4); Autonudge absorption; v2 Slices 9-11
- Proactive Assistant (triage pipeline + decision journal — its ambient digest slice already landed via plan 42)
- Evaluation Substrate (Sessions 3-6); Agent Packs & Portable Bundles
- **Security Hardening (plan 47: keychain, signed manifests, gate fuzzing, SEL surface, external review)**
- Agent Rooms (plan 62 — PROPOSED; un-defer only after WORKFLOWS-V2 core slices + ACP-AGENT-PARITY land; council workflow template front-runs it as a LOOPS-EVOLUTION library candidate)

## Boundary Note: Memory vs Knowledge

- **Knowledge** = the user's personal items — documents, files, photos, notes, ingested URLs; `knowledge.db`; future providers (Google Drive, Google Photos) plug in via `KnowledgeProvider` ABC. Plans: KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS, WATCHED-SOURCES, PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT (decision journal items).
- **Memory** = the harness's internal mechanics — facts/facets/episodic/procedural/lessons about the user; `memory.db` (cwd-partitioned); the learning lifecycle belongs here. Plans: LEARNING-FLYWHEEL, MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT, PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT (approval patterns).

## Boundary Note: Inbox vs Notifications (rev 9)

- **Inbox** = THE durable attention store: externally-arriving items AND standing agent requests (proposals, needs-input), typed by (source, kind), with lifecycle and dedup. Plan 42 unifies the surfaces (skills proposals, flywheel proposal queue → inbox kinds).
- **Notifications** = the ephemeral, per-(source, kind)-configurable delivery layer over inbox items and transient events — `DashboardState.notify()` stays the single choke point; rules decide never/badge/immediate/digest and targets (dashboard, channel DM, push). Unread counts derive from inbox lifecycle only.

---

## Research Library

The 95-source research corpus has been distilled into a source-agnostic learnings library at `docs/research/learnings/` (14 topic files, ~320 mechanisms). Per-source originals have been retired — all durable content lives in the topic files; all roadmap-actionable items are folded into the plans above. See `docs/research/learnings/README.md` for the index and highest-conviction cross-corpus findings. Public republication of curated topics on gideon.dev is planned (DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH Session 5).

Targeted research docs live at `docs/roadmap/research/`:

- `multi-tenancy-entity-audit.md` (2026-07-14) — code-evidence audit of every provider seam and entity store: tenancy-readiness matrix and the harness-side readiness gaps (username identity, contributor attribution, owner-filter on trigger arming, provenance-weighted recall). Grounds plan 29.
- `team-shared-harness-research.md` (2026-07-14) — adversarially-verified internet research on 2025-2026 shared/multi-tenant agentic harnesses (11 unanimous findings). Ecosystem context for plan 29 — the harness implements only the client side of these patterns.
- `acp-agent-parity-audit.md` — native loop vs claude-code/codex/kiro-cli capability matrix. Grounds plan 28.
- The 2026-07-18 pre-launch investigation & owner alignment review grounds plans 31-47 (rev 9): offering gap analysis (distribution, channels, contribution model, CI, discoverability, platform reach), the inbox/notifications boundary investigation (plan 42), and the provider-boundary residue verification (plan 32).
