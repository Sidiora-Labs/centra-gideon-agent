# Gideon Roadmap

Active and planned feature work. Each entry links to a detailed plan document in `plans/`.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-19 · **rev 10** — 52 plans / 6 pillars / ~285 sessions.

- **rev 10** — Pillar F "Product Depth & Craft" added (48 App-Platform-Evolution, 49 Knowledge-Library, 50 Session-Management, 51 Design-System-Consistency, 52 Fluid-Motion), from the owner's product-depth ask.
- **rev 9** — pre-launch alignment: 17 plans (31-47) added from the pre-launch investigation & owner review under new Pillar E (Launch, Reach & Ecosystem) + additions to B/C/D; PUBLICATION amended (repos under the `Gideon` GitHub org, gideon.dev primary domain, force-push/SOURCE_REV retired → feature-branches-to-`main`); EXTERNAL-ACCESS §3 read-only MCP extracted to plan 41. Deepened plans carry Contracts & Interfaces + executor task tables; see the three companion docs below.
- **rev 4-8** (earlier) — ACP Agent Parity (4), TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES (5), Multi-Tenant rescope (6), grok-build learnings folded into CONTEXT-ECONOMY/EXTERNAL-ACCESS/PLATFORM-RESILIENCE (7), HARNESS-CRAFT (8).

## Program Structure

52 plans across 6 conceptual pillars. Plans interleave via execution waves; the engine carries embedded acceptance criteria from downstream plans. The research corpus lives at `docs/research/learnings/` (14 source-agnostic topic files, ~320 mechanisms) — feed a topic file to any implementation session for mechanism-level grounding.

**Every implementation session executes under [plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md](plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md)** — the standing ground rules (scope discipline, definition of done, validation-as-a-user, deviation ledger, escalation triggers) that let plan tasks be delegated to any session, including smaller models, without eroding standards. Deepened plans carry executor-ready task tables (ID / task / files / done-when); a session that can't tell what "done" means for a task treats that as a defect in the task, not license to improvise.

**Three cross-cutting companion docs:**
- [plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md](plans/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md) — the standing ground rules every session runs under (above).
- [plans/INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md](plans/INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md) — **how the rev-9 plans fit together**: the build-order/data-flow map, the shared-seam inventory (each contract defined once, referenced everywhere), the mechanical conventions (config wiring, error envelopes, SEL events, storage, fail-open-vs-closed, sdk exports), the verified existing primitives, and the three "landmine" convergence points. Read this before any single plan. Each deepened plan carries a `Contracts & Interfaces` section (exact dataclasses, signatures, JSON schemas, wire contracts) + an `Integration points` list (calls / called-by / storage / gates) so a session — including a smaller model — never invents a shape another plan also touches.
- [plans/REV9-ALIGNMENT-AND-OWNER-TASKS.md](plans/REV9-ALIGNMENT-AND-OWNER-TASKS.md) — binds the original plans 1-30 to the protocol, annotates their rev-9 alignment deltas, and holds the single consolidated **owner-tasks index across all 47 plans** (accounts, spend decisions, credentials, hardware, validations you must drive, copy sign-offs).

**Alignment principles (rev 9, owner-set):**

1. **Clean architecture and implementation state outrank early feature availability.** Applied as: never pull a feature forward onto an unclean seam — the seam work lands first (e.g. sender trust before channels, the kind registry before digest, the lifecycle doctrine before any migration-bearing plan).
2. **The engine program keeps its position.** WORKFLOWS-V2 remains the Wave-1 architecture investment; the launch/reach plans (Pillar E) run in Waves 0-2 alongside it rather than displacing it.
3. **The clean-break doctrine graduates.** Post-publication, migration-bearing changes follow the LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE lifecycle (gate → dual-path → migrate → cleanup); plan 31 lands first in Wave 0 because it shapes how every other plan's changes land.
4. **Zero telemetry is a feature.** No adoption instrumentation is added anywhere in this program; public signals only (stars, PyPI downloads, GitHub traffic).

## Boundary Note: Memory vs Knowledge

- **Knowledge** = the user's personal items — documents, files, photos, notes, ingested URLs; `knowledge.db`; future providers (Google Drive, Google Photos) plug in via `KnowledgeProvider` ABC. Plans: KNOWLEDGE-SYNTHESIS, WATCHED-SOURCES, PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT (decision journal items).
- **Memory** = the harness's internal mechanics — facts/facets/episodic/procedural/lessons about the user; `memory.db` (cwd-partitioned); the learning lifecycle belongs here. Plans: LEARNING-FLYWHEEL, MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT, PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT (approval patterns).

## Boundary Note: Inbox vs Notifications (rev 9)

- **Inbox** = THE durable attention store: externally-arriving items AND standing agent requests (proposals, needs-input), typed by (source, kind), with lifecycle and dedup. Plan 42 unifies the surfaces (skills proposals, flywheel proposal queue → inbox kinds).
- **Notifications** = the ephemeral, per-(source, kind)-configurable delivery layer over inbox items and transient events — `DashboardState.notify()` stays the single choke point; rules decide never/badge/immediate/digest and targets (dashboard, channel DM, push). Unread counts derive from inbox lifecycle only.

---

## Research Library

The 95-source competitive-research corpus has been distilled into a source-agnostic learnings library at `docs/research/learnings/` (14 topic files, ~320 mechanisms). Per-source originals have been retired — all durable content lives in the topic files; all roadmap-actionable items are folded into the plans above. See `docs/research/learnings/README.md` for the index and highest-conviction cross-corpus findings. Public republication of curated topics on gideon.dev is planned (DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH Session 5).

Targeted research docs live at `docs/roadmap/research/`:

- `multi-tenancy-entity-audit.md` (2026-07-14) — code-evidence audit of every provider seam and entity store: tenancy-readiness matrix and the harness-side readiness gaps (username identity, contributor attribution, owner-filter on trigger arming, provenance-weighted recall). Grounds plan 29.
- `team-shared-harness-research.md` (2026-07-14) — adversarially-verified internet research on 2025-2026 shared/multi-tenant agentic harnesses (11 unanimous findings). Ecosystem context for plan 29 — the harness implements only the client side of these patterns.
- `acp-agent-parity-audit.md` — native loop vs claude-code/codex/kiro-cli capability matrix. Grounds plan 28.
- The 2026-07-18 pre-launch investigation & owner alignment review grounds plans 31-47 (rev 9): competitive/offering gap analysis (distribution, channels, contribution model, CI, discoverability, platform reach), the inbox/notifications boundary investigation (plan 42), and the provider-boundary residue verification (plan 32).
