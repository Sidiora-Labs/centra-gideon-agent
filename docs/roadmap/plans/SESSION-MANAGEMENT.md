# SESSION-MANAGEMENT

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/SM.md`](../atomic/SM.md) as 8 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Session Management — Organize, Find, and Curate Conversations at Scale

**Status:** DONE — Session 1 (FTS5 cross-session search + match snippets) shipped
2026-07-28; Session 2 T2.2/T2.3 (bulk ops + lifecycle + auto-archive) shipped 2026-07-29; Session 3
(retention surface, starters, redacted export) shipped 2026-07-30, which also fixed an S2 bug that
made the auto-archive rule inert for non-resident sessions.
**T2.1 (suggested organization) shipped 2026-08-11** as atom SM-5 — the plan's last unbuilt task. Its
stated blocker (no `emit_attention_item(kind="proposal")`, no `InboxItem` kind field) was cleared by
INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION S1-S5 on 2026-07-30, verified live before building. T1.3's sidebar
windowing was re-scoped — there is no chat sidebar; see the Execution log. Created 2026-07-18

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18)

- **Session model** (`session.py`, `SessionManager`): FIFO message queue per session, pooling, channel-link map, memory modes (temporary/incognito). **History** (`history.py`): one JSONL per session under `sessions/`, 2MB rotation → `sessions/archive/`, 7-day archive retention. Metadata (`chat_persistence.py`): `folder_id`, tags, `is_pinned`, color, kanban tag-columns; `restore_recent_sessions` (folders/pins survive a restart window). API surface (from the earlier route audit): sessions CRUD, fork/undo/drop, resume/approve, regenerate/switch-variant/edit-resend, generate-title, color/folder/pin, tags, tag-columns (kanban), side-conversation lifecycle, handoff/channel-link.
- **Gaps for scale:** (1) **no cross-session search** (you can't find "that chat where I set up the Slack app"); (2) organization is **all-manual** (no auto-foldering, no suggested tags); (3) **no bulk ops** (archive/tag/delete many); (4) lifecycle is implicit (JSONL rotation is storage, not a user-facing archive/retention model — old sessions just accumulate in the sidebar); (5) **no templates/starters** (every chat starts blank; common setups aren't reusable); (6) **no export/share** of a conversation.

## Design

- **S1 — Cross-session search + a scalable sidebar:** an FTS index over session titles + message content (a `session_search` FTS5 table fed from history, incremental on turn-write; respects temporary/incognito — those are never indexed) with a search endpoint; the sidebar gains a search box + result grouping (by folder/date/match). Sidebar virtualization for large lists (the list is already `ListScaffold`-based — verify + add windowing). "Jump to message" from a result.
- **S2 — Smart organization + bulk:** **suggested organization** — a deterministic-first, LLM-last pass (per the corpus doctrine) that proposes a folder/tags for an untagged session (cheap heuristics: title keywords, workspace dir, channel origin → then an LLM suggestion only if ambiguous), surfaced as a *proposal* (propose-don't-write — an inbox `proposal` item per plan 42, or an inline accept chip). **Bulk operations**: multi-select → archive/tag/folder/delete/export. **Auto-archive rule**: sessions untouched for N days (configurable) move to an Archived view (not deleted — distinct from history JSONL rotation), decluttering the sidebar while staying searchable.
- **S3 — Lifecycle + templates + export:** an explicit **session lifecycle** (active / archived / pinned-never-archive) with a retention policy surface (what auto-archives, what never does, when archived sessions are purgeable — the user's call, defaults conservative); **session templates/starters** (save a session's setup — agent binding, model, system context, first prompt — as a reusable starter; "New from template"); **export** (a conversation → Markdown/JSON, credential-redacted via the existing `history.py` redaction) and **share** (a redacted read-only artifact via the artifacts system, never auto-published — owner action).

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md); class B — clean break under the pre-1.0 banner)

### C1 — Session search (`session_search.py`, new; FTS5 via `sqlite_compat` per plan 39)
```python
def index_turn(session_key: str, role: str, text: str) -> None: ...   # incremental; SKIPS temporary/incognito
def search_sessions(query: str, *, limit=30, folder=None) -> list[dict]: ...  # {session_key, title, snippet, ts, match_count}
def reindex_all() -> int: ...   # boot/repair; heartbeat-driven like the existing FTS reindex
```
Store: `~/.gideon/session_search.db` (its own FTS5 DB; not memory/knowledge). Respects the restriction registry (`session_restrictions.py`).

### C2 — Session metadata additions (`chat_persistence.py` session meta; additive)
```python
# NEW meta fields (tolerant reads; old sessions default):
lifecycle: str = "active"        # active | archived
last_activity_at: float = 0.0    # drives auto-archive
never_archive: bool = False      # pinned-lifecycle
template_id: str = ""            # if created from a template
```

### C3 — Templates + bulk + export (new routes; §2.2 envelope)
```python
# templates stored in entity_settings/session_templates.json
def save_template(*, name, agent, model, system_context, first_prompt="") -> str: ...
def create_from_template(template_id) -> str: ...  # returns new session_key
# bulk
POST /api/chat/sessions/bulk {ids:[...], action:"archive|tag|folder|delete|export", ...}
# export
GET /api/chat/sessions/{session}/export?format=md|json   # credential-redacted (history.py redaction)
```

### Integration points
- **Calls:** `history.py` (index source + redacted export), `session_restrictions` (index gating), `sqlite_compat`/`require_fts5` (plan 39), the heartbeat reindex hook, `emit_attention_item(kind="proposal")` (plan 42, org suggestions), the artifacts system (share), an idempotent index backfill keyed on data inspection (no separate migration framework — it does not exist).
- **Called by:** the chat sidebar (search, bulk, archived view), "New from template".
- **Storage owned:** `session_search.db`, `session_templates.json`, the four session-meta fields.
- **Gate/migration:** `session_management` (class B); migration backfills `last_activity_at` from history mtimes + reindexes.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — Cross-session search + scalable sidebar

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | `session_search.py`: FTS5 index (via `sqlite_compat`), `index_turn` on turn-write (skip temporary/incognito), `search_sessions`, `reindex_all` on the heartbeat (mirror the existing FTS reindex) | `src/gideon/session_search.py`, turn-write hook, heartbeat | indexing a chat makes it findable; an incognito session is never indexed (test) |
| T1.2 | Search endpoint + sidebar search box + result grouping + jump-to-message | chat handlers, `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` sidebar | search returns ranked sessions; clicking a result opens it scrolled to the match |
| T1.3 | Sidebar windowing for large lists (verify ListScaffold; add virtualization if absent) | sidebar component | 500-session fixture scrolls smoothly (no jank; measure) |
| V1 | Validation: 100+ seeded sessions → find one by content in <2s; incognito exclusion verified; token-lint/theme pass | — | holds |

### Session 2 — Smart organization + bulk + auto-archive

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Suggested organization: deterministic heuristics → LLM only if ambiguous → propose (accept chip or inbox proposal); never auto-applies | new `session_organize.py`, frontend chip | an untagged session gets a sensible folder/tag *proposal*; accept applies, ignore leaves it |
| T2.2 | Bulk ops endpoint + multi-select bar (archive/tag/folder/delete/export) | chat handlers, sidebar | select many → archive in one action; archived leave the active list but stay searchable |
| T2.3 | Auto-archive: `last_activity_at` + a config rule (`session.auto_archive_days`, default 30, 0=off, 5-point wired) + an Archived view + `never_archive` pin | `chat_persistence.py`, config, sidebar | a stale fixture session auto-moves to Archived; a `never_archive` one never does |
| V2 | Validation: declutter a busy sidebar via bulk + auto-archive; nothing lost (all findable) | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Lifecycle + templates + export (Wave 3)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | Retention surface: what auto-archives / never / when purgeable (conservative defaults; purge is explicit + confirmed, distinct from history JSONL rotation) | Settings + sidebar | retention policy editable; purge requires confirm + shows what's affected |
| T3.2 | Templates: save-as-template (agent/model/system-context/first-prompt) + "New from template" | `session_templates.json`, template API, composer/new-chat UI | save a configured session as a starter; new-from-template reproduces the setup |
| T3.3 | Export + share: Markdown/JSON export (redacted) + optional read-only shared artifact (never auto-published) | export endpoint, artifacts integration | export round-trips redacted; share produces a redacted artifact only on explicit action |
| V3 | Validation: full lifecycle — template→chat→archive→search→export | — | holds |

## Owner tasks (real world)
1. **Dogfood the auto-archive default** (30 days) on your real instance — tune it to your rhythm before it ships as a default.
2. Decide the **retention/purge defaults** — conservative proposed (archive freely, purge never-by-default, always explicit). This touches your data; your call.
3. Approve **suggested-organization** behavior (propose-only, never auto) — confirm you don't want silent auto-foldering.

## Risks & open questions
- **Search-index build cost** on a large existing history — `reindex_all` runs incrementally on the heartbeat (not a boot-blocking sweep); a fixture with thousands of sessions is the test.
- **Redaction completeness on export** — reuses `history.py`'s existing redaction (the same path session-archive reads use); a seeded-secret fixture proves it.
- **Open:** whether templates should capture *loaded skills/knowledge context* too — defer to a v2 (starters cover the 80%); DISCOVERY-file if demand appears.

## Execution log

### 2026-07-28 — Session 1 (T1.1, T1.2 + V1): DONE. T1.3 re-scoped — see below.

New `session_search.py`: an FTS5 index over session transcripts with `index_turn` on
turn-write, `search_sessions`, and an incremental `reindex_all` on the heartbeat.
Replaces a linear scan that read up to 500 transcript files per query and silently
stopped finding anything past that window.

**DEVIATION (E1) — `sqlite_compat` does not exist.** §C1 specifies "FTS5 via
`sqlite_compat` per plan 39". That module has never been written: it appears only as
aspirational text in PLATFORM-REACH and in this plan's own §C1/§C3. Rather than
build a compat layer this plan doesn't own, availability is handled the way the rest
of the repo already handles it — `except sqlite3.OperationalError` around table
creation and queries, returning empty so the caller falls back. Verified by
simulating an FTS5-less SQLite build in a test. When PLATFORM-REACH lands
`sqlite_compat`, this is a one-line swap.

**DEVIATION — a session-grained index, not a turn-grained one.** §C1's `index_turn`
signature is preserved, but the turn's own text is not what gets stored: the whole
transcript is re-read and the session's single row replaced. Reason:
`_save_session_to_history` REWRITES the entire JSONL on every turn, so appending
per-turn rows would drift out of sync with the file it's supposed to mirror. One row
per session also makes `snippet()` return the best-matching passage from the whole
conversation instead of an arbitrary turn.

**Restricted-session exclusion is enforced at three points**, not one: when indexing
(the persisted `memory_mode` and the live registry), when re-indexing (a
now-restricted session is purged), and again at READ time. The read-time check is
what makes a session hidden the instant it's reclassified, rather than at the next
sweep.

**T1.3 (sidebar windowing) — RE-SCOPED, and the premise was wrong.** The task says
"the sidebar gains a search box… the list is already ListScaffold-based — verify +
add windowing". **There is no chat sidebar**: `ChatPage.tsx:350` documents "No left
sidebar" explicitly. The session list lives in `ChatHistoryPage` (a dedicated
`#/chat/history` page), which already HAS a search box wired to
`/api/sessions/search` with a 300ms debounce — so T1.2's "add a search box" was
already built. What was missing is *why* a result matched: the page discarded
everything but the keys. It now renders the index's snippet under the title with the
matched terms marked. Windowing is deferred to Session 2 with a measurement first —
the page renders plain rows and the honest answer is that nobody has shown it janks;
adding virtualization to an un-profiled list is speculative work, and Session 2
already owns that page for bulk actions.

**Two bugs found by driving a real gateway with 120 seeded sessions** (neither
visible to unit tests):

1. **A fresh install had no index for five minutes.** `HeartbeatService._tick` starts
   at 1, so `_tick % 5 == 0` first fires on tick 5 — exactly the window where a new
   user tries search and finds the narrow scan. The sweep now also runs on tick 1.
   (Worth noting the same off-by-cadence affects the pre-existing tick-15 FTS
   rebuild; left alone as out of scope, but it's the same shape.)
2. **The fallback scan leaked restricted sessions.** `ConversationLog.search_sessions`
   checked only the persisted `memory_mode`, so a session marked incognito AFTER some
   lines were written — its metadata still saying "persistent" — was returned in
   content search. This is a PRE-EXISTING gap, not introduced here, but the new
   endpoint made it observable: the index correctly excluded the session while the
   scan surfaced it. Both paths now consult the live registry too.

**V1 validated as a user** (isolated dev home, 120 seeded sessions + a needle):
first-tick index build; `source: index` with a `<<pomegranate>>`-marked snippet in
**31ms**; a session marked incognito after the fact refused by BOTH the index and the
scan; zero errors in the gateway log. The endpoint now reports which path answered
(`source: index|scan`), which is what made the leak visible in the first place.

**Snippets are rendered as parsed parts, never HTML** — the text is user-authored
transcript content, so `<<`/`>>` markers are split into marked spans rather than
injected as markup; an unpaired marker degrades to plain text.

Tests: `tests/test_session_search.py`, 56 cases. Full suite 8631 passed; lint clean;
web typecheck + 268 vitest + build green. **Remaining: Sessions 2-4** (organization/
bulk/auto-archive, templates, export) — separate clean sub-scopes, not started.

- 2026-07-29 — **DONE (S2, T2.2 + T2.3).** Bulk session ops + the session lifecycle
  (archive / restore / never-archive) + the auto-archive rule, end to end.
  - **Backend:** new `dashboard/session_lifecycle.py` (the pure rule: `stale_session_keys`
    previews, `run_auto_archive` applies, `set_lifecycle` transitions) and
    `dashboard/session_bulk.py` (`POST /api/chat/sessions/bulk`,
    `POST /api/chat/sessions/auto-archive`, `PATCH /api/chat/sessions/{session}/lifecycle`).
    Three fields on `_ChatSession` (`lifecycle`, `last_activity_at`, `never_archive`)
    wired through `__slots__`, `to_dict()`, and **all three** `chat_persistence` meta
    sites. `session.auto_archive_days` (default 30, 0=off) wired through the full
    round-trip contract incl. `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`. Hourly heartbeat pass via a new
    `on_auto_archive` callback (the heartbeat has no `DashboardState` and shouldn't grow
    one, so the gateway injects it like `on_due_commitments`).
  - **Frontend:** Active/Archived segmented view (server-filtered via `?archived=1`, URL-
    backed so the archive is deep-linkable), row multi-select + a selection bar
    (Archive / Restore / Never archive), per-row context-menu lifecycle actions, and a
    persistent outcome note ("Archived 38 · 2 not found").
  - **New primitive:** `ui/forms.tsx` gains **`Checkbox`** (+ `.doc.ts` + 3 tests). The
    primitive-adoption ratchet correctly rejected a raw `<input type="checkbox">`, and
    there was no checkbox primitive; it owns the `stopPropagation` guard that clickable
    list rows need, so no call site can forget it.
  - **DEVIATION — T2.1 (suggested organization) NOT taken; it is BLOCKED.** Its spec
    requires `emit_attention_item(kind="proposal")`, which **does not exist**: the only
    occurrence in the tree is a forward-looking comment at `feedback.py:379`, and
    `InboxItem` has no `kind` field at all (`inbox.py:62-88`; `Classification` is
    needs_reply/fyi/noise). Building it means inventing the attention contract that
    **INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION owns** — a guaranteed rewrite. Deferred to after
    that plan lands. (Note `chat_retag.py` already covers much of T2.1's user value.)
    **↳ RESOLVED 2026-08-11 by `SM-5`** — Inbox-Unification landed the contract this
    waited on, and T2.1 shipped. This entry stays as the record of why it waited; it is
    no longer a statement of current state.
  - **BUG FOUND IN OWN WORK, during as-a-user validation:** rehydration replays a
    transcript through `_ChatSession.append()`, so the un-archive-on-use rule fired on
    LOAD — an archived chat silently un-archived itself just by being opened, or by a
    restart restoring it. Fixed by using `ts` as the live-vs-replay discriminator (a live
    turn passes none; replay passes each message's stored ts). Test added.
  - **Upgrade safety:** `last_activity_at == 0.0` (every session predating the field)
    reads as **not stale**. Treating unknown as ancient would archive a user's entire
    history on first run. Also: default-valued sessions write **no** new meta keys, so
    existing meta lines stay byte-identical.
  - **Deliberate omission:** `delete` is NOT a bulk op. Bulk deletion is irreversible and
    must not sit one mis-click from archive, which is reversible.
  - **Validated as a user** on an isolated dev home: bulk-archived 2 of 3 (one bogus key
    reported `missing` without failing the batch); active/archived lists split correctly;
    restore round trip returned all rows; `never_archive` set; the config kill switch
    (`0` → `enabled:false`) verified through the real PATCH route; multi-select →
    Archive → outcome note observed stably across 8 samples with the row count dropping;
    0 console errors, 0 gateway tracebacks.
  - **Gates:** `make lint` clean (mypy 538 files) · backend **8809 passed** · web
    **283 passed** (32 files) + typecheck + build. The offline agent reference was
    regenerated (`python -m gideon.manifest_reference`) since three routes are new —
    its drift test caught that, as designed.
  - Pre-existing/unrelated: `test_cron.py`'s spring-forward test (core issue #85).

### 2026-07-30 — Session 3 (T3.1, T3.2, T3.3 + V3): DONE. Plan COMPLETE.

Retention surface, session starters, and redacted export — plus a **latent S2 bug this
session's validation exposed** (below), which was the difference between a retention rule
that works and one that only appeared to.

**BUG FOUND IN S2's SHIPPED WORK — the auto-archive rule was inert for its main case.**
`stale_session_keys` iterated `state._sessions` (resident sessions) only. But
`dashboard.restore_sessions` defaults to **False** (`config/loader.py:739-745`), and
`restore_recent_sessions` otherwise only loads sessions modified inside a 30-minute
window (or pinned/foldered) — so **a chat idle for months is precisely the one that is
NOT in memory**. The rule therefore skipped exactly the sessions it exists to archive,
and reported `count: 0` while doing it. Measured on a real gateway with 3 sessions seeded
90 days stale: preview said `0`; the same 3 after adding a `folder_id` (which forces a
restore) said `1`. `stale_session_keys` now sweeps both halves and `run_auto_archive`
archives a non-resident session by writing `lifecycle` into its transcript metadata line
(`_archive_on_disk`) — **without loading it**, since restoring every stale chat just to
archive it would undo the reason it wasn't resident. Live re-verify: `count: 0` → `count:
4`, archived on disk, idempotent on a second run, gone from the active list, present in
`?archived=1`, and **restorable** via both the single-session PATCH and bulk restore
(reversibility is the entire safety argument for archiving on a timer). 14 new tests
pin the disk half, including the same upgrade-safety rule (`last_activity_at`
missing ⇒ NOT stale), channel-thread exemption, no-double-count when a session is both
resident and on disk, and a broken-listing degrade-to-resident-only path.

- **T3.1 — retention surface.** `session.auto_archive_days` shipped in S2 wired through
  four of the config contract's five points; **the frontend control was never built**, so
  a rule that archives chats after 30 days was running hourly with no way to see or change
  it. Added to `ChatPanel`'s existing "Context & lifecycle" section (not a new panel), with
  a **live preview** driven by the existing `dry_run` endpoint — so the number shown is the
  number that would move, not an estimate. A retention rule the user can't inspect is
  indistinguishable from data loss.
  - **Purge deliberately NOT built.** §T3.1 mentions a purge surface; S2 deliberately
    excluded bulk delete because irreversible actions must not sit beside reversible ones,
    and the single-session DELETE already carries its own confirmation. Adding a bulk purge
    here would undo that decision for no user demand. Recorded rather than silently skipped.
- **T3.2 — starters.** New `dashboard/session_templates.py` (`entity_settings/
  session_templates.json`, so it rides the durability inventory's existing
  `entity_settings` item and needs no backup wiring) + routes. Captures **setup only** —
  agent, model, reasoning effort, optional first prompt — never the transcript, and
  deliberately not the workspace binding (a template dragging a workspace path along would
  point a new chat at a directory the user wasn't thinking about). The field dict doubles
  as the key **allowlist** and type schema, mirroring `INBOX_DEFAULTS`.
  - **DEVIATION — no server-side `create_from_template()`.** §C3 sketched
    `create_from_template(template_id) -> session_key`. The chat page mints a session
    lazily on first send (`ChatPage.tsx::ensureSession`), so a second server-side creation
    path would mean two ways a session comes into existence AND would leave an empty chat
    behind whenever a user opened a starter and walked away. Picking a starter instead
    **prefills** the composer selection + prompt and lets the one existing `ensureSession`
    path run. Same user outcome, one creation path.
- **T3.3 — export.** New `dashboard/session_export.py`: Markdown or JSON, via
  `GET /api/chat/sessions/{session}/export?format=md|json`, following `portability.py`'s
  established `Content-Disposition` download pattern.
  - **PREMISE CORRECTED — export does NOT inherit "history.py's existing redaction."**
    The plan's §S3/risks say export "reuses `history.py`'s existing redaction". The
    dashboard write path redacts assistant/tool content but **deliberately SKIPS `user` and
    `system` roles** (`chat_persistence.py:606-608`), and `ConversationLog.append` redacts
    nothing at all — so a credential the user *typed* is stored raw. Export re-runs both
    passes over **every** role: defense-in-depth for the already-redacted ones, and the
    only redaction the user/system roles ever get before text leaves the machine. Verified
    live end-to-end: a transcript containing `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` and a Slack bot token
    in a **user** message exported with both replaced by `[REDACTED: credential]`. Titles
    are redacted too (an auto-titled session can carry the secret in its title).
  - Message content is emitted as a **blockquote** so a conversation about markdown can't
    restructure the export around its own headings. The artifact declares `redacted: true`
    so a consumer never mistakes it for a verbatim transcript.
- **BUG IN OWN WORK, caught by a test written for it:** `export_filename` filtered on
  `str.isalnum()`, which is **True for CJK and accented letters** — so a Japanese chat
  title produced a non-ASCII filename, and the route emits the plain `filename="…"` form,
  which cannot carry those bytes. Now filters on `isascii() and isalnum()` with a `chat`
  fallback, so the download works regardless of the user's locale.
- **Validated as a user** on an isolated dev home (never `~/.gideon`), driving the
  real gateway + browser: template CRUD incl. the 400 on a blank name; the literal
  `templates` path **not** captured by `/{session}` (the aiohttp ordering hazard `bulk`
  already had); export md/json + 400 on a bad format + 404 on an unknown session + correct
  `Content-Disposition`/`nosniff` headers; the config round-trip through the real PATCH
  route (`45` persisted → rule reads it → `0` reports `enabled:false` → `99999` rejected);
  the retention row rendering `30 days` with its live preview; the starter chip applying
  agent+model+effort+prompt and enabling Send; starter delete from Settings. **0 console
  errors, 0 gateway tracebacks from the new code** (the log's only tracebacks are
  `no model provider resolves for use case 'background'` — expected with no model bound in
  a throwaway home). SEL audit confirmed for `chat.session_export`,
  `chat.template_create`, `chat.sessions_auto_archive`.
- **Gates:** `make lint` clean (mypy 550 files) · backend **9034 passed** · web
  **283 passed** (32 files) + typecheck + build. Offline agent reference regenerated
  (5 new routes) — its drift test caught the staleness, as designed.
- Tests: `tests/test_session_starters.py` (33) + 14 added to `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.

~~**The plan is now COMPLETE except T2.1 (suggested organization)**, which stays BLOCKED on
INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION owning the `emit_attention_item(kind="proposal")` contract
— unchanged from S2's finding, and `chat_retag.py` already covers much of its user value.~~

**SUPERSEDED — corrected 2026-08-12. The plan is COMPLETE, full stop.** T2.1 shipped on
2026-08-11 as `SM-5`; the DONE entry is below in this same log ("suggested organization ships,
and this plan has no unbuilt task left"), with `session_organize.py`, the `OrganizeChip`
frontend, the closed proposal space and the two suppression tiers. The blocker it cites had
cleared: `emit_attention_item` exists and Inbox-Unification S1-S5 landed. Two paragraphs in
this file still described T2.1 as unbuilt — including the S2 DEVIATION above, which was
accurate when written — so a reader (or a roadmap tick) picking from the header rather than
the log would nominate work that already exists. Left struck through rather than deleted,
because the S2 reasoning is the honest record of why it waited.
- [2026-08-11][SM-5 / T2.1] DONE: suggested organization ships, and this plan has no unbuilt task left. Organization was all-manual, so sessions accumulated with neither folder nor tag and stopped being findable — the gap this plan's own Context names as "organization is all-manual".
  **Deterministic first, model only on genuine ambiguity.** Three signals run in specificity order and the FIRST to produce a non-empty proposal wins: title keywords matched against the user's EXISTING folder/tag vocabulary, then `workspace_dir` basename against folder names, then channel origin (tag-only). `is_ambiguous()` gates the model and requires all three of: a vocabulary to sort into, a title carrying topic words, and no deterministic match — so no vocabulary or no title means no roundtrip at all. The proposal space is CLOSED: `parse_llm_reply` re-resolves every returned name against the live folder/tag lists, so a hallucinated folder cannot reach a proposal and therefore cannot reach an accept click that would create it. `test_deterministic_path_never_calls_the_model` spies the stream helper and asserts zero calls.
  **"Untagged" means NEITHER folder nor tag, not either.** Taken from `dashboard/chat_persistence.py:409-415`, where an existing `has_folder` check already treats a foldered session as organized (it survives the plain-recents cutoff). A chat filed in a folder is findable whether or not it also carries tags, so proposing for it would be advice about a solved problem. Restricted-mode sessions are excluded.
  **Never auto-applies — proven three ways, because one is not enough.** (1) Behavioural: `test_proposing_does_not_touch_the_session` and `test_surfacing_does_not_touch_the_session` assert `folder_id == "" and tags == []` after both generating and surfacing. (2) Structural: an AST sweep asserts no function other than `apply_proposal` assigns `session.folder_id`/`session.tags`, covering the paths a behavioural test never drives — and I verified the sweep HAS TEETH by re-running its logic against a poisoned copy of the module with an injected second writer, which it correctly flagged (a structural assertion that cannot fail is decoration). (3) Architectural: `apply_proposal` re-validates the folder against live `state._folders` — an echoed proposal is not trust — and resolves tags through the shared `find_tag_by_name`/`create_tag` rather than becoming a second writer.
  **Two suppression tiers, because one leaks.** The dedup key is `session_organize:{key}:{folder_id}:{sorted tags}` — session PLUS proposed value. Keying on the session alone would suppress every later proposal too, including a better one produced once the auto-titler gave the chat a real title; value-keying dedupes an identical re-proposal (nagging) while letting a genuinely different one surface (new information). Tag order is normalized. But `emit_attention_item`'s own `dedup_key` only matches PENDING/SEEN rows (`inbox.py:473`), so a DISMISSED proposal would be re-raised on the next scan — hence a persisted decline record in `entity_settings/session_organize.json`, fail-open on corruption.
  **DISCOVERY — a real bug in the resolver, found by a red test rather than reasoning.** `InboxStore.flush()` returns early unless `_dirty` is set, and assigning `item.status` in place never sets it, so `flush()` silently persisted nothing and the row stayed `pending`. The shipping `skills/proposals._resolve_inbox_item` calls `save()` for exactly this reason. Fixed, and routed through `live_store(state)` per that helper's docstring warning about the running service's in-memory store.
  **DEVIATION — the plan's Context path is stale.** Session metadata lives in `dashboard/chat_persistence.py`, not a top-level `chat_persistence.py`.
  **DEVIATION — reused `_stream_background_prompt` rather than adding an LLM helper.** It is the auto-titler's shared background-session path; a second utility-prompt convention beside it is the drift this project deletes.
  **DEVIATION — no new notification kind.** Reused the registered `skills/proposal` pair instead of registering `sessions/proposal`, which would hand the user two "proposal" delivery rules to keep in sync for one concept and would need a matching `notificationMeta.ts` row (there are ratchets in both directions).
  **Chip placement.** `web/src/pages/chat/OrganizeChip.tsx`, above the composer beside the existing `RoutingChip`, using the shipped `Button`/`IconButton` primitives with an accessible name on dismiss. There is no `web/src/pages/sessions/` and no chat sidebar (T1.3's re-scope), so `ChatPage.tsx` is the only surface where a user sees one specific session; keyed on `turns.length` so it re-asks once a turn lands and a title exists.
  **Gate (re-run independently, not taken from the report).** PYTHONPATH proof first — `gideon.session_organize.__file__` resolving under the worktree, since the venv is editable-installed against main and a bare `pytest` silently tests main. black/isort/flake8 clean (1486 files); `mypy src/gideon harness` clean on 784 files; 113 passed across the new 33-test suite plus the inbox suites and all three full-suite-only ratchets (`inert_surface_baseline`, `docs_lint_baseline`, `agent_reference`); FULL `npm run test --workspace web` 1141 tests / 116 files passed (not path-scoped — the design ratchets sweep the whole tree); `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both exit 0, checked by exit code rather than by reading a piped tail.
  **Two generated files moved, both verified as no-drift.** `reference/routes.md` gained exactly the 3 new routes (620→623 agent-callable) and was regenerated in the same commit — a full-suite-only ratchet a file-scoped run would miss. `docs/design/consistency-audit.json` is regenerated by `npm run build`: `filesScanned` 431→432 for the new component with `driftHits` (7) and `filesWithDrift` (6) UNCHANGED, so no new drift was blessed; the build's timestamp-only re-churn was reverted rather than committed.
- [2026-08-11][SM-9 / T3.3 second half] DONE: share ships, and T3.3 is finally both of its halves. **The finding:** T3.3 (line 96) requires "Markdown/JSON export (redacted) **+ optional read-only shared artifact (never auto-published)**", done when "export round-trips redacted; **share produces a redacted artifact only on explicit action**" — and §S3 plus Integration points both name "the artifacts system (share)". Only export shipped. The execution-log entry above is headed "**T3.3 — export.**" and documents export alone; in code there was no share route (`grep -rn share dashboard/server.py` returned an unrelated MCP comment and a memory scope), no `share_session`/`publish_session`/`shareable` symbol anywhere in `src/gideon`, and no frontend affordance (`web/src/lib/api.ts` carried only the export URL). Yet `docs/roadmap/atomic/SM.md`'s `SM-8` row was ✅ with an evidence line asserting "share produces a redacted read-only artifact only on explicit owner action, never auto-published" — a claim no code backed. Both halves of that are now fixed: the code makes the claim true, and SM-8's row/section/`dag.json` node were corrected to say plainly that export shipped and share is SM-9.
  **Scope held deliberately narrow: share means INSIDE the instance.** The artifact lands in the owner's own library, reachable only through the gateway's existing session auth. No public URL, no token-bearing link, no unauthenticated route, nothing added to any auth-bypass allowlist. Publishing a conversation off the machine is EXTERNAL-ACCESS's scope and an owner decision, so this atom does not build, stub, or gesture at it — and the FE label says "Share as read-only artifact" rather than "Share" so nobody reads a publish promise into the menu item.
  **The redactor is reused, not reimplemented.** The artifact body is `session_export.render_markdown(...)`'s output **verbatim**, and `test_shared_body_is_the_export_verbatim` asserts byte equality — that is what stops a future "share renderer" from redacting slightly less than export does. `session_export._redact` was promoted to the public `redact_field` so the artifact NAME goes through the same one implementation (an auto-titled chat can carry the secret in its title). The premise correction recorded in that module's docstring is why this matters: the dashboard write path skips `user`/`system` roles, so this pass is the only redaction those roles ever get.
  **What enforces read-only: a persisted `Artifact.readonly` + a refusal in the STORE.** `NativeArtifactProvider.update`, `update_binary` and `revert` raise `PermissionError` (which `artifacts/handlers.py` already maps to a 400 with the message, so a refusal reads as "this artifact is read-only" rather than the misleading 404 a `None` return gives). The guard is in the provider, NOT in `handlers.py`, because the MCP artifact tools and workflow action providers call the provider directly — a route-level check would leave the model an unguarded door to the same edit. All three mutating methods are enumerated exhaustively rather than inferred. `delete` stays allowed: read-only is not undeletable, and trapping the owner's own artifact in their library is a worse bargain. Metadata-only updates are refused too — a record whose name/tags can be rewritten is a record whose provenance can be rewritten. Kind is `markdown` (a TEXT kind nothing executes, unlike `widget`/`html`/`react`) and source is `manual` (the other sources all name an automated producer). That combination is what makes "cannot round-trip back into a session" true: there is no path that turns an artifact into chat history, and the frozen body cannot be edited toward the unredacted original.
  **Never auto-published — proven, and the proof was checked for teeth.** `share_session` has exactly one call site: the explicit `POST /api/chat/sessions/{session}/share` handler. `test_share_has_exactly_one_call_site` is an AST census over every `.py` under `src/gideon`, counting both the attribute and bare-import call forms, asserting the set is exactly `{("dashboard/session_starters.py", "api_session_share")}`. Copying SM-5's technique, the census itself is tested: `test_the_call_site_census_has_teeth` feeds it a poisoned source set with a heartbeat tick and a post-turn hook calling `share_session` and asserts it flags both — a structural assertion that cannot fail is decoration. No cron, no heartbeat, no "share on archive" convenience exists.
  **Restricted chats are refused (403), and the asymmetry with export is asserted.** An incognito/temporary chat promises to leave nothing durable behind; an artifact IS durable library state. Export still works, because a download is the user holding their own text for a moment. The gate reuses `session_search.is_restricted` (metadata `memory_mode` + the live restriction registry) rather than adding a third restriction check, and the test is parametrized over the whole closed `_RESTRICTED_MODES` set read from the source of truth, plus a vacuity case asserting a `persistent` chat still shares — a gate that refuses everything looks identical to one that refuses the right things.
  **BUG IN OWN WORK, caught by a test written for it:** the first restricted-mode test used `memory_mode="ephemeral"`, which is not in `_RESTRICTED_MODES` (`{"temporary", "incognito"}`), and the route happily returned 201. Reading the closed set instead of guessing at it is what turned a passing-looking gate into a real one; the test now parametrizes over the set itself so a third mode cannot be added without wiring it here.
  **Nothing ships inert.** The route has a live FE caller: "Share as read-only artifact" in the ChatHistory row context menu, beside the two Export items (the export affordance's existing home — `ChatPage.tsx`'s `ContextMenu`, an existing `ui` primitive, so the label is the accessible name and no `<button>` or raw hex/px was hand-rolled). On success it toasts the artifact name and navigates to `artifacts/<slug>`, mirroring `FilesSection`'s create-then-open pattern — "it worked" is only credible if you can see the thing. The new `readonly` field has readers on both sides: three store refusals, and in the FE `ArtifactViewer` (a "Read-only record" banner, no editor/save/snapshot, no revert button) plus `ArtifactsSection` (the collection control is absent, since `update` would refuse it) — no affordance is offered that the server will refuse.
  **DEVIATION — `create_binary` gained no `readonly` parameter.** Adding one would ship an inert parameter (nothing needs a frozen binary today). The `update_binary` guard is still in place so a future writer cannot slip past it, and its test sets the flag on disk to reach the guard — the point is the guard exists before the writer does, not that today's callers can reach it.
  **DEVIATION — re-sharing writes a NEW artifact rather than a new version.** An upsert would have to mutate a readonly artifact, which is the one thing the guarantee exists to prevent, and two shares taken at different points are two records, not two versions of one.
  **Small refactor, one concern:** `_read_transcript` extracted from the export handler so export and share resolve the same history key the same way and cannot disagree about what "conversation not found" means.
  **Gate (re-run independently).** PYTHONPATH proof first — `gideon.dashboard.session_share.__file__` resolving under the worktree, since the venv is editable-installed against another tree and a bare `pytest` would silently test that one. `make lint` clean (black 1557 files, isort, flake8, mypy 803 source files); `tests/test_session_share.py` 22 passed; the `-k "session or export or artifact or share"` selection 1831 passed / 4 skipped; the three full-suite-only ratchets plus config round-trip (`inert_surface_baseline`, `agent_reference`, `docs_lint_baseline`, `config_roundtrip`) 35 passed; FULL `npm test --workspace web` 1497 tests / 151 files passed (not path-scoped — the design ratchets sweep the whole tree), `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both exit 0 by exit code. `reference/routes.md` gained exactly the one new route (632→633 agent-callable) and was regenerated in the same commit; `docs/design/consistency-audit.json`'s build churn was `generatedAt`-only (`driftHits` 7 / `filesScanned` 442 unchanged) and was reverted rather than committed. The suite's real-home rail reported `~/.gideon` unchanged on every run.
  **BUG IN OWN WORK #2, caught by typecheck:** a `{/* … */}` comment placed in a JSX *attribute* position (inside `<TopBar …>`) is a syntax error, not a comment. Moved to a plain comment on a derived `canFile` constant above the element.
