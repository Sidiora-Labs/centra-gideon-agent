# Plan: Session Management — Organize, Find, and Curate Conversations at Scale

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — Session 1 (FTS5 cross-session search + match snippets) shipped 2026-07-28;
Sessions 2-4 (organization + bulk + auto-archive, templates, export) not started. T1.3's sidebar
windowing was re-scoped — there is no chat sidebar; see the Execution log. Created 2026-07-18
(roadmap rev 10; owner ask: chat session management improvements)
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Wave:** 2 (S1-2: search + organization) + 3 (S3: lifecycle + templates)
**Depends on:** nothing hard (builds on the shipped session model). Coordinates with ONBOARDING-UX (43 — progressive disclosure of session features), DESIGN-SYSTEM-CONSISTENCY (51 — the chat sidebar is a flagship surface), INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION (42 — sessions surface needs-input items), CONTEXT-ECONOMY (12 — long-session compaction is upstream).
**Scope:** the chat sidebar already has folders/tags/kanban/pin/color/fork/undo/variants/side-conversations — but at 100+ sessions it becomes a scroll. This plan makes conversations **findable, organizable at scale, and curatable through a lifecycle**: cross-session search, smart auto-organization, bulk operations, session lifecycle (active→archived→retention), templates/starters, and export/share. **Soul guardrail:** sessions are core-owned standalone entities (not pluggable) — this stays in core; the FIFO-queue, memory-mode, and history-rotation invariants are untouched. Class **B** where it adds persisted session metadata (gate `session_management` + migration).

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18)

- **Session model** (`session.py`, `SessionManager`): FIFO message queue per session, pooling, channel-link map, memory modes (temporary/incognito). **History** (`history.py`): one JSONL per session under `sessions/`, 2MB rotation → `sessions/archive/`, 7-day archive retention. Metadata (`chat_persistence.py`): `folder_id`, tags, `is_pinned`, color, kanban tag-columns; `restore_recent_sessions` (folders/pins survive a restart window). API surface (from the earlier route audit): sessions CRUD, fork/undo/drop, resume/approve, regenerate/switch-variant/edit-resend, generate-title, color/folder/pin, tags, tag-columns (kanban), side-conversation lifecycle, handoff/channel-link.
- **Gaps for scale:** (1) **no cross-session search** (you can't find "that chat where I set up the Slack app"); (2) organization is **all-manual** (no auto-foldering, no suggested tags); (3) **no bulk ops** (archive/tag/delete many); (4) lifecycle is implicit (JSONL rotation is storage, not a user-facing archive/retention model — old sessions just accumulate in the sidebar); (5) **no templates/starters** (every chat starts blank; common setups aren't reusable); (6) **no export/share** of a conversation.

## Design

- **S1 — Cross-session search + a scalable sidebar:** an FTS index over session titles + message content (a `session_search` FTS5 table fed from history, incremental on turn-write; respects temporary/incognito — those are never indexed) with a search endpoint; the sidebar gains a search box + result grouping (by folder/date/match). Sidebar virtualization for large lists (the list is already `ListScaffold`-based — verify + add windowing). "Jump to message" from a result.
- **S2 — Smart organization + bulk:** **suggested organization** — a deterministic-first, LLM-last pass (per the corpus doctrine) that proposes a folder/tags for an untagged session (cheap heuristics: title keywords, workspace dir, channel origin → then an LLM suggestion only if ambiguous), surfaced as a *proposal* (propose-don't-write — an inbox `proposal` item per plan 42, or an inline accept chip). **Bulk operations**: multi-select → archive/tag/folder/delete/export. **Auto-archive rule**: sessions untouched for N days (configurable) move to an Archived view (not deleted — distinct from history JSONL rotation), decluttering the sidebar while staying searchable.
- **S3 — Lifecycle + templates + export:** an explicit **session lifecycle** (active / archived / pinned-never-archive) with a retention policy surface (what auto-archives, what never does, when archived sessions are purgeable — the user's call, defaults conservative); **session templates/starters** (save a session's setup — agent binding, model, system context, first prompt — as a reusable starter; "New from template"); **export** (a conversation → Markdown/JSON, credential-redacted via the existing `history.py` redaction) and **share** (a redacted read-only artifact via the artifacts system, never auto-published — owner action).

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE](INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md); class B per plan 31)

### C1 — Session search (`session_search.py`, new; FTS5 via `sqlite_compat` per plan 39)
```python
def index_turn(session_key: str, role: str, text: str) -> None: ...   # incremental; SKIPS temporary/incognito
def search_sessions(query: str, *, limit=30, folder=None) -> list[dict]: ...  # {session_key, title, snippet, ts, match_count}
def reindex_all() -> int: ...   # boot/repair; heartbeat-driven like the existing FTS reindex
```
Store: `~/.gideon/session_search.db` (its own FTS5 DB; not memory/knowledge). Respects the restriction registry (`session_restrictions.py`).

### C2 — Session metadata additions (`chat_persistence.py` session meta; additive)
```python
# NEW meta fields (tolerant reads; old sessions default):
lifecycle: str = "active"        # active | archived
last_activity_at: float = 0.0    # drives auto-archive
never_archive: bool = False      # pinned-lifecycle
template_id: str = ""            # if created from a template
```

### C3 — Templates + bulk + export (new routes; §2.2 envelope)
```python
# templates stored in entity_settings/session_templates.json
def save_template(*, name, agent, model, system_context, first_prompt="") -> str: ...
def create_from_template(template_id) -> str: ...  # returns new session_key
# bulk
POST /api/chat/sessions/bulk {ids:[...], action:"archive|tag|folder|delete|export", ...}
# export
GET /api/chat/sessions/{session}/export?format=md|json   # credential-redacted (history.py redaction)
```

### Integration points
- **Calls:** `history.py` (index source + redacted export), `session_restrictions` (index gating), `sqlite_compat`/`require_fts5` (plan 39), the heartbeat reindex hook, `emit_attention_item(kind="proposal")` (plan 42, org suggestions), the artifacts system (share), plan-31 migration.
- **Called by:** the chat sidebar (search, bulk, archived view), "New from template".
- **Storage owned:** `session_search.db`, `session_templates.json`, the four session-meta fields.
- **Gate/migration:** `session_management` (class B); migration backfills `last_activity_at` from history mtimes + reindexes.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under [EXECUTION-PROTOCOL](EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md))

### Session 1 — Cross-session search + scalable sidebar

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | `session_search.py`: FTS5 index (via `sqlite_compat`), `index_turn` on turn-write (skip temporary/incognito), `search_sessions`, `reindex_all` on the heartbeat (mirror the existing FTS reindex) | `src/gideon/session_search.py`, turn-write hook, heartbeat | indexing a chat makes it findable; an incognito session is never indexed (test) |
| T1.2 | Search endpoint + sidebar search box + result grouping + jump-to-message | chat handlers, `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` sidebar | search returns ranked sessions; clicking a result opens it scrolled to the match |
| T1.3 | Sidebar windowing for large lists (verify ListScaffold; add virtualization if absent) | sidebar component | 500-session fixture scrolls smoothly (no jank; measure) |
| V1 | Validation: 100+ seeded sessions → find one by content in <2s; incognito exclusion verified; token-lint/theme pass | — | holds |

### Session 2 — Smart organization + bulk + auto-archive

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Suggested organization: deterministic heuristics → LLM only if ambiguous → propose (accept chip or inbox proposal); never auto-applies | new `session_organize.py`, frontend chip | an untagged session gets a sensible folder/tag *proposal*; accept applies, ignore leaves it |
| T2.2 | Bulk ops endpoint + multi-select bar (archive/tag/folder/delete/export) | chat handlers, sidebar | select many → archive in one action; archived leave the active list but stay searchable |
| T2.3 | Auto-archive: `last_activity_at` + a config rule (`session.auto_archive_days`, default 30, 0=off, 5-point wired) + an Archived view + `never_archive` pin | `chat_persistence.py`, config, sidebar | a stale fixture session auto-moves to Archived; a `never_archive` one never does |
| V2 | Validation: declutter a busy sidebar via bulk + auto-archive; nothing lost (all findable) | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Lifecycle + templates + export (Wave 3)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | Retention surface: what auto-archives / never / when purgeable (conservative defaults; purge is explicit + confirmed, distinct from history JSONL rotation) | Settings + sidebar | retention policy editable; purge requires confirm + shows what's affected |
| T3.2 | Templates: save-as-template (agent/model/system-context/first-prompt) + "New from template" | `session_templates.json`, template API, composer/new-chat UI | save a configured session as a starter; new-from-template reproduces the setup |
| T3.3 | Export + share: Markdown/JSON export (redacted) + optional read-only shared artifact (never auto-published) | export endpoint, artifacts integration | export round-trips redacted; share produces a redacted artifact only on explicit action |
| V3 | Validation: full lifecycle — template→chat→archive→search→export | — | holds |

## Owner tasks (real world)
1. **Dogfood the auto-archive default** (30 days) on your real instance — tune it to your rhythm before it ships as a default.
2. Decide the **retention/purge defaults** — conservative proposed (archive freely, purge never-by-default, always explicit). This touches your data; your call.
3. Approve **suggested-organization** behavior (propose-only, never auto) — confirm you don't want silent auto-foldering.

## Risks & open questions
- **Search-index build cost** on a large existing history — `reindex_all` runs incrementally on the heartbeat (not a boot-blocking sweep); a fixture with thousands of sessions is the test.
- **Redaction completeness on export** — reuses `history.py`'s existing redaction (the same path session-archive reads use); a seeded-secret fixture proves it.
- **Open:** whether templates should capture *loaded skills/knowledge context* too — defer to a v2 (starters cover the 80%); DISCOVERY-file if demand appears.

## Execution log

### 2026-07-28 — Session 1 (T1.1, T1.2 + V1): DONE. T1.3 re-scoped — see below.

New `session_search.py`: an FTS5 index over session transcripts with `index_turn` on
turn-write, `search_sessions`, and an incremental `reindex_all` on the heartbeat.
Replaces a linear scan that read up to 500 transcript files per query and silently
stopped finding anything past that window.

**DEVIATION (E1) — `sqlite_compat` does not exist.** §C1 specifies "FTS5 via
`sqlite_compat` per plan 39". That module has never been written: it appears only as
aspirational text in PLATFORM-REACH and in this plan's own §C1/§C3. Rather than
build a compat layer this plan doesn't own, availability is handled the way the rest
of the repo already handles it — `except sqlite3.OperationalError` around table
creation and queries, returning empty so the caller falls back. Verified by
simulating an FTS5-less SQLite build in a test. When PLATFORM-REACH lands
`sqlite_compat`, this is a one-line swap.

**DEVIATION — a session-grained index, not a turn-grained one.** §C1's `index_turn`
signature is preserved, but the turn's own text is not what gets stored: the whole
transcript is re-read and the session's single row replaced. Reason:
`_save_session_to_history` REWRITES the entire JSONL on every turn, so appending
per-turn rows would drift out of sync with the file it's supposed to mirror. One row
per session also makes `snippet()` return the best-matching passage from the whole
conversation instead of an arbitrary turn.

**Restricted-session exclusion is enforced at three points**, not one: when indexing
(the persisted `memory_mode` and the live registry), when re-indexing (a
now-restricted session is purged), and again at READ time. The read-time check is
what makes a session hidden the instant it's reclassified, rather than at the next
sweep.

**T1.3 (sidebar windowing) — RE-SCOPED, and the premise was wrong.** The task says
"the sidebar gains a search box… the list is already ListScaffold-based — verify +
add windowing". **There is no chat sidebar**: `ChatPage.tsx:350` documents "No left
sidebar" explicitly. The session list lives in `ChatHistoryPage` (a dedicated
`#/chat/history` page), which already HAS a search box wired to
`/api/sessions/search` with a 300ms debounce — so T1.2's "add a search box" was
already built. What was missing is *why* a result matched: the page discarded
everything but the keys. It now renders the index's snippet under the title with the
matched terms marked. Windowing is deferred to Session 2 with a measurement first —
the page renders plain rows and the honest answer is that nobody has shown it janks;
adding virtualization to an un-profiled list is speculative work, and Session 2
already owns that page for bulk actions.

**Two bugs found by driving a real gateway with 120 seeded sessions** (neither
visible to unit tests):

1. **A fresh install had no index for five minutes.** `HeartbeatService._tick` starts
   at 1, so `_tick % 5 == 0` first fires on tick 5 — exactly the window where a new
   user tries search and finds the narrow scan. The sweep now also runs on tick 1.
   (Worth noting the same off-by-cadence affects the pre-existing tick-15 FTS
   rebuild; left alone as out of scope, but it's the same shape.)
2. **The fallback scan leaked restricted sessions.** `ConversationLog.search_sessions`
   checked only the persisted `memory_mode`, so a session marked incognito AFTER some
   lines were written — its metadata still saying "persistent" — was returned in
   content search. This is a PRE-EXISTING gap, not introduced here, but the new
   endpoint made it observable: the index correctly excluded the session while the
   scan surfaced it. Both paths now consult the live registry too.

**V1 validated as a user** (isolated dev home, 120 seeded sessions + a needle):
first-tick index build; `source: index` with a `<<pomegranate>>`-marked snippet in
**31ms**; a session marked incognito after the fact refused by BOTH the index and the
scan; zero errors in the gateway log. The endpoint now reports which path answered
(`source: index|scan`), which is what made the leak visible in the first place.

**Snippets are rendered as parsed parts, never HTML** — the text is user-authored
transcript content, so `<<`/`>>` markers are split into marked spans rather than
injected as markup; an unpaired marker degrades to plain text.

Tests: `tests/test_session_search.py`, 56 cases. Full suite 8631 passed; lint clean;
web typecheck + 268 vitest + build green. **Remaining: Sessions 2-4** (organization/
bulk/auto-archive, templates, export) — separate clean sub-scopes, not started.
