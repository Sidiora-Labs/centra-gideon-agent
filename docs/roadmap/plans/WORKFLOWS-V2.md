# WORKFLOWS-V2

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/WV.md`](../atomic/WV.md) as 12 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Workflows v2 — Composable Execution Platform

**Status:** DONE — Slices 0-11b shipped (PRs #134-#161, on `main`). The engine is live-wired, not
inert: 26 REST routes registered from `dashboard/server.py`, 19 `workflow_*` chat tools via
`mcp_workflows`, 20 bundled templates, and the `web/src/pages/workflows/` cockpit.
**REMAINING** (the 2026-07-26 amendment): WF2-A2's node-inspect endpoint, WF2-A3's inspector drawer
+ cached badge (`workflowFold.ts`'s `cached?` is declared and read by nothing), and §2's
`artifact_inspect` + `{{nodes.x.artifact}}` offloading. Status corrected 2026-08-04 by code audit —
this line had read PROPOSED since the plan was written. (rev 2 — research-integrated 2026-07-12)

Recon corrections applied in this revision (verified against code 2026-07-12): the SubagentManager "no recursion" contract is **prompt-level only** today (`_SYSTEM_PREFIX` in subagent.py — no code check exists), so `__wf_depth` is genuinely new enforcement mirroring the existing `__hook_depth` pattern (hooks.py:721, invoke_agent_provider.py:66); run events are delivered via a per-run `SseRegistry` + the multiplexed WS `_broadcast` (the loop pattern, dashboard/state.py:1056) — NOT `state.notify(...)`, which is the user-notification gate behind `notification_allowed` (mute/severity/quiet-hours) and would eat engine events; every new SSE event type MUST be registered in the FE stream hook's lifecycle union (useRunStream.ts `RUN_LIFECYCLE` — EventSource silently drops unregistered types); the old feature's match threshold is **0.62** (`workflows.match_threshold`, loader.py:1052 — 0.55 is the *skills* surfacing threshold, unrelated); config wiring is **four** points, not two (see §7.5); and deleting `workflows/registry.py` outright would orphan the `workflow` provider _TypeHandler and break `PROVIDER_TYPES` ↔ handler parity (the #47 bug class) — the handler is repointed, not removed (§7).

## Overview

Replace the current "mini skill / checklist SOP" workflow feature with a full composable workflow-execution platform modeled on the ultracode/Workflow tool pattern. The new feature supports:

- Declarative graph-spec workflows with composable execution constructs (sequences, parallel fan-out, loops, conditional branches, waits, gates, agent orchestration patterns, sub-workflow nesting)
- A journaled execution engine with resume, rewind, run_from, fork, and crash recovery — with external side effects tracked so time travel is safe
- Mid-flight editing of unexecuted stages via chat (rewind, skip, restructure, update prompts) with engine-computed cascade previews
- Live chat widget mirroring the loop/SdlcProgressCard pattern (blocking and background modes)
- Batteries-included workflow templates (research, project planning, design, coding, deep internet research, produce-and-audit) built on a shared conventions pack
- Chat tools for planning, executing, inspecting, observing, auditing, and managing workflow runs

The current workflow feature (stateless SOPs with embedding-based auto-surfacing) is fully deleted. The `workflow` namespace in code, config, API routes, MCP tools, and FE surfaces is reused by the new feature with zero conceptual conflicts.

## Architecture Decision

**Chosen approach: Declarative Graph Spec with Pure Frontier Scheduler**

After evaluating three architecture angles (declarative graph, sandboxed script DSL, and hybrid graph+script) with independent adversarial judging across feasibility, UX/editability, and engine-correctness lenses, the declarative-graph approach won on:

1. **Editability** — the spec IS the render tree; structural edits are typed tree ops validated in batch; no script-reparse needed.
2. **Widget rendering** — the node tree maps directly to the live progress widget (each node = a row/card with status).
3. **Mid-flight safety** — a pure `frontier(spec, state)` function re-derives scheduling from scratch after any mutation, with a frozen-region invariant that prevents editing running/done nodes.
4. **Template authoring** — JSON graph specs are introspectable, composable, and LLM-friendly (chat can plan and restructure them via tools).

Key ideas grafted from the other proposals:
- **Epoch-stamped journal keys** from the script-DSL angle (proven in ultracode runs) for resume/rewind cache invalidation.
- **Binding expressions in prompts** (template variables resolved late) for output→input wiring without embedding a scripting language.
- **Compile-time macro patterns** (judge_panel, verify_panel, route) as pre-defined template sub-graphs that expand at definition time into the core node types.

The research pass (batches 1-5) independently converged on this same shape across every production system studied — the rev-2 additions concentrate where the original spec was thin: external side effects under replay, what actually re-runs after rewind/mutation, who owns completion, and a node outcome model richer than done|failed.

### Node Taxonomy (the construct algebra)

The spec is a **tree of containers** — containers render directly as the widget tree. DAG shapes inside `parallel` use optional `needs: [sibling_ids]`.

| Kind | Key Fields | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `sequence` | `children: Node[]` | Run children in order |
| `parallel` | `children: Node[]`, `join: all\|any\|quorum(n)`, `max_concurrency`, per-child `needs[]` | Fan-out; intra-block DAG via `needs`; joins gated by ACTIVE edges (§2) |
| `foreach` | `items: binding`, `body: Node`, `max_concurrency`, `pipeline: bool`, `cap?`, `on_item_error: halt\|skip\|collect` (default skip) | Dynamic fan-out over resolved array; `pipeline=true` = no barrier between stages; per-item journal checkpointing so interrupted fan-outs resume mid-collection (WF2-R5) |
| `loop` | `body: Node`, `mode: counted{n}\|until{condition}\|until_dry{streak}`, `circuit_breaker` (§2) | Iterate body; `until_dry` = clean-streak termination (proven in campaign DAG runner) |
| `stage` | `prompt: template`, `agent?`, `model_tier?`, `effort?`, `schema?`, `enforcement?`, `tools_posture`, `isolation?`, `cwd?`, `allowed_write_paths?`, `required_artifacts?`, `session: fresh\|continuous`, `max_turns?`, `timeout_total?`, `timeout_stall?`, `retry?`, `on_error?` | One subagent execution via `SubagentManager.spawn` |
| `infer` | `prompt: template`, `model_tier?`, `schema?` | **NEW (WF2-R16):** one bounded model call via `one_shot_completion` — NO tools, no SubagentManager spawn, no session. For classification, extraction, scoring, synthesis, judge legs. Output schema-validated by the engine; ledger accounts it as ONE model call |
| `branch` | `on: binding_expr`, `cases: {label: Node}`, `default?: Node` | **NEW (WF2-R17):** conditional dispatch — evaluate the binding, route to the matching case (or default); unmatched without default = typed BindingError. Taken path recorded in run state (feeds active-edge join gating, §2). Spec validation requires case coverage when the binding source declares an enum |
| `transform` | `expr: binding`, `output_contract?` | Zero-token pure data reshaping (filter/map/flatten/count) |
| `action` | `provider`, `config`, `output_contract?`, `allowed_write_paths?` | Zero-token action-provider dispatch (bash, notify, create-task); effect-ledgered when side-effecting (§2); may return a clarification request → needs_input (§5) |
| `wait` | `duration_secs \| until_ts` | Timer gate, evaluated on watchdog poll |
| `gate` | `kind: approval\|verify_command\|verify_script\|event\|expression`, `verify?: {script, until: success, max_iters}`, `timeout_secs?` (mode-dependent defaults, §5), `on_timeout`, `self_judge: false` | Blocks until satisfied; `approval` → run enters `needs_input` with a typed ask payload (§5); completion is engine-executed, never agent-declared (§2) |
| `subworkflow` | `ref: name@version`, `inputs: {bindings}` | Nesting; expanded in-run at ready time; depth ≤ 3; emits `child_run_attach` ledger event (WF2-R13) |

**Model tiers (WF2-R16 batch-5):** `model_tier: reasoning|standard|fast` is a first-class field on ALL LLM-backed nodes (`stage` and `infer`), resolved against a small declarative slot map in workflows config (`workflows.model_tiers = {reasoning: "...", standard: "...", fast: "..."}`). Templates reference tiers symbolically, staying portable across whatever models the user has bound. Resolution threads the resolved model as the **`model` build kwarg** (the registry's `register_entry` raises on duplicate names — never re-register; the model kwarg wins over `entry.model` in every factory, per provider_bridge.py:844-853). `infer` nodes route through `one_shot_completion`'s reasoning-axis mapping (llm_helpers.py — the "reasoning" chat sub-category resolves a plain ModelProvider, NOT the NativeAgentRuntime that chat/code_tools would trigger). This is deliberately the whole mechanism — no routing solver, no pricing store (the AIOS ILP ceiling we explicitly do not build).

### Node Outcome Model (WF2-R5)

Richer than done|failed — retrofitting these into journal keys and widget semantics later is far more painful than speccing them now:

- **`done` may be DEGRADED**: a node can succeed with a machine-readable `degraded_reason` (e.g. `diarization_skipped:no_token|401|network`) recorded in the ledger and flagged as degraded provenance on its output — templates keep working when optional capabilities are absent (degrade, don't die). Fallback-satisfied nodes carry the same flag.
- **Typed failure taxonomy**: failure events carry `{class: user|transient|network|permission|..., cause_plain, remediation, recoverable: bool, retryable: bool, terminal_reason, suggestion}` — the scheduler retries only transient/retryable classes; the widget renders `remediation` (actionable next step) distinct from the error. Machine-written `failure_signature` records use a 4-layer taxonomy `{failing_node, stage, layer: routing|execution|verification|governance, reason, input_hash}` for cheap localization and cross-run diffing.
- **Extended terminal states**: `no_change` (inherits prior results instead of re-running downstream evaluation), `scope_violation` (§2 Write Scope), `discarded`, `escalated` (circuit breaker, §2), `blocked{kind: protocol_violation}` (§2 Termination).
- **Judge-flavored outcomes** are three-state — `passed(score)`, `failed(score)`, `verifier_absent` — with aggregate pass-rates computed over the *requested* count (dropped work counts as failure).

### Binding Expressions (output → input wiring)

```
{{inputs.topic}}                              # workflow input
{{item}}                                      # foreach current item
{{iter}}                                      # loop iteration index
{{nodes.<id>.output}}                         # another node's structured output
{{nodes.<id>.output.findings | filter('verdict','CONFIRMED')}}
{{nodes.<id>.artifact}}                       # offloaded large-output artifact pointer (§2)
{{last.output.done}}                          # loop body's last iteration
{{secret:KEY}}                                # credential_ref — resolved server-side at dispatch (§ Secrets)
```

Grammar: dotted path + closed set of pure pipes (`filter`, `map`, `flatten`, `slice`, `count`, `default`, `json`) plus sanitization pipes (`xml_escape`, `truncate(n)`, `tojson`, `slugify`) (WF2-R9). Resolved late (at node ready-time) against the run's output store.

**Hardening (WF2-R9):**
- Whole-string refs (`{{nodes.x.output}}` alone) preserve source type (dict/list/int); refs embedded in larger strings stringify via `json.dumps` — two distinct, specified resolution paths.
- "Node produced null" flows through (`filter` drops nulls — declarative `.filter(Boolean)`); "reference doesn't resolve" (unknown node id / missing path) raises a **typed `BindingError`** journaled on the node — never a silent empty string.
- Spec-validation lint **rejects** bindings whose origin is untrusted content (trigger/webhook inputs, fetched web content) flowing unfiltered into prompt positions — the mechanical seam is `fence_untrusted` (security.py, re-exported via `sdk.security`), applied by lint requirement rather than template-author discipline. Critical once AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE feeds trigger payloads into workflow inputs.
- Soft type-compatibility warnings at validation time. (The whole-value-only floor is the cautionary tale: without filters/interpolation, comparison logic leaks into node executors as regex hacks — keep both in scope.)

### Secrets Hygiene (WF2-R14)

- `action`/`stage` node configs reference credentials via `{{secret:KEY}}` / `credential_ref` bindings resolved server-side at dispatch against the credential store (`.env` via `save_credential`, 0600) — never inline values in workflow.json, run spec, journal, outputs, or ledger (which the flywheel later reads).
- GET of a def/run strips secret-bearing config into boolean `_has*` presence flags; save re-injects from stored state via a stable node-id map so mutation ops that move/copy a node keep credentials; fork copies credential state server-side.
- The journal/events writer is wrapped in a **RedactingSink** reusing `security.redact()` (credentials + exfil URLs — the same helper the loop store applies to all reads) to mask credential-shaped values before persistence — defense in depth for secrets arriving via node OUTPUT (a fetch response echoing a token), which the spec-side seam alone can't catch.
- Spec validation flags inline secret-shaped values.

### Agent Orchestration as Compositions (not node types)

High-frequency ultracode patterns expressed as node compositions:

- **Fan-out agents** = `parallel` of `stage` nodes
- **Judge panel** = `parallel[infer judges]` → `transform(avg score, rank)` — scoring legs compile to `infer` nodes (WF2-R16), a fraction of stage cost/latency/slot consumption
- **Adversarial verify** = `foreach(findings, pipeline=true)` of `infer(refute-prompt, schema:{verdict})` → `transform(filter CONFIRMED)`
- **Route** = `infer(classify intent into enum)` → `branch(on: output.category, cases: {...})` with per-branch model-tier selection (WF2-R17 — the Anthropic routing pattern as a one-liner macro)
- **Fan-out lenses** = same input, N parallel `stage`/`infer` nodes with different prompt lenses (the multi-type-content complement to route; needs no new node kind)
- **Pipeline per-item** = `foreach{pipeline:true, body: sequence[stage1, stage2, ...]}`
- **Loop-until-dry** = `loop{mode: until_dry{streak: 3}, body: sequence[find, dedup, verify]}`

Bundled **template macros** (e.g. `verify_panel`, `judge_panel`, `route`, `research_sweep`) expand at definition time into these core nodes, giving users one-liner patterns without engine complexity.

### Persistence Layout

```
~/.gideon/workflows/
  defs/<name>/workflow.json          # user-editable spec (fs-watched)
  bundled/<name>/workflow.json       # shipped templates (mtime-synced on boot)
  bundled/shared/                    # shared prompt-block library (§6, WF2-R15)
  runs.db                            # SQLite WAL: lean run rows (+ index on (root_run_id, status))
  runs/<8hex>/
    spec.json                        # live run spec (versioned, atomic_write)
    spec_history/v<NNN>.json         # per-mutation record: {ops[], actor, ts, hash}
    state.json                       # {instances: {path: {state, epoch, attempt, active_edges, ...}}}
    outputs/<path-hash>.json         # per-node structured output
    outputs/attic/v<NNN>/            # rewind archive (old outputs preserved)
    journal/attic/v<NNN>/            # rewind-superseded journal regions (WF2-R2)
    artifacts/                       # offloaded large node outputs (§2 Context Lifecycle)
    checkpoints/<NNN>.json           # per-super-step state snapshot (fork points)
    journal.jsonl                    # append-only resume cache
    events.jsonl                     # emitted event log (incl. Run Ledger subset + effect records, §5)
    CANCEL                           # persisted sticky cancel INTENT (§2 Termination; replaces bare STOP)
```

All JSON writes via `atomic_write` (the platform convention); run rows in SQLite WAL mode, same idiom as `loop/store.py`.

**Run retention (scaling guard):** run rows/dirs are pruned by a tiered policy so high-frequency origins (a per-minute trigger, implicit subagent-tool runs) can't flood the disk: per-def cap (default 100 runs, matching ScheduleRun's per-job cap), origin-tiered TTL (`subagent-tool`: 7 days unless pinned; `schedule`/`event`: per-trigger cap; `chat`/`manual`: user-pruned only), and the `pinned` flag exempting any run. Terminal runs compact `journal.jsonl` (cache no longer needed) keeping only `events.jsonl` + outputs.

**Crystallize-before-prune (WF2-R13):** before a run drops a retention tier, its journal is LLM-compressed (via `one_shot_completion`, "background" use-case) into a durable digest — narrative, key decisions, outcomes, artifacts, lessons — persisted as a ledger event. Pruned runs stay rememberable and feed the flywheel's run-outcome mining. (These digests are Run Ledger data — engine mechanics feeding the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL memory work; they are NOT knowledge-store items.)

**Deletion sweep contract (WF2-R13):** retention deletion enumerates every sibling artifact kind (spec_history, outputs, attic, checkpoints, journal, artifacts), schema-validates pointer sidecars before following them off-dir, is ENOENT-tolerant, refuses paths escaping the run dir, and purges optimistic FE caches on delete (`invalidateCache` — each of these is a documented failure mode).

**Backup coverage:** `snapshot.py` `VALID_COMPONENTS` and `portability.py` gain a `workflows` component so backup/restore carries defs + pinned runs (in-flight runs quiesced or excluded). Recon confirms neither covers `~/.gideon/workflows/` today (persistence gotcha #10 — no "everything" component exists), so this is additive work in both files, not a checkbox.

## 2. Execution Engine

### Architecture (three actors, mirroring the loop triad)

1. **`RunController`** (one per active run, in-memory): owns an `asyncio.Lock` serializing scheduler ticks and mutations; owns the run's asyncio task set.

2. **Pure frontier core — `workflows/tick.py`:**
   ```python
   def frontier(spec: WorkflowSpec, states: InstanceStates, now: float, limits: Limits
   ) -> FrontierDecision:
       """Zero-I/O, deterministic. Returns: ready[], waiting[], attention[], run_verdict."""
   ```
   Every input is persisted → restart re-derives identical decisions. Exhaustively unit-testable. (Prior art: `loop/tick.py`'s pure `evaluate(cfg, state, now) -> Decision` — noting that in the loop engine only the sdlc kind consumes it; here frontier() is THE scheduler for all runs.)

3. **`WorkflowWatchdog`** — one 5s poll (registered in server startup next to `LoopWatchdog`, which uses the same `POLL_INTERVAL_SECS=5` cadence): evaluates timers/gates/stall deadlines/circuit breakers, calls `controller.tick()`. Event-driven ticks fire on node completion and after mutations, so the poll is just the wait/gate/stall clock. (There is no timer heap in the platform to reuse — the watchdog poll IS the timer mechanism, same as loops.)

### Node Instance Lifecycle

pending → ready → running → done | failed | skipped | cancelled
                         ↘ waiting (wait/gate nodes)
                         ↘ blocked{protocol_violation} | escalated | scope_violation | no_change
```

Terminal states are **frozen** except via explicit rewind/run_from ops. The frozen-region invariant ensures no mutation can touch done/running nodes. `done` carries the optional degraded flag; see §1 Node Outcome Model for the full taxonomy.

### Scheduling & Concurrency

`tick()` under the lock computes the frontier, launches ready stages as `asyncio.create_task` wrappers around `SubagentManager.spawn(...)`. Inherits for free:
- Global concurrency caps + FIFO queueing (`_MAX_CONCURRENT=3` fixed or `resolve_max_subagents` auto-sizing [2,8]; over-cap spawns queue with staggered drain)
- Memory/cwd guards (`check_memory_available`, `validate_cwd` against `agent.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots`) + 30-min timeout + reaper
- Transcript persistence + orphan reconciliation
- Approval/safety gates per run trust level

**Typed executor lanes (WF2-R21):** the run/global concurrency budget is partitioned into 3 typed lanes derived automatically from node kind — `llm` (stage, infer), `io` (action nodes: bash, fetch, local-model warm-up, embedding/index work), and `compute` (transform, binding eval — effectively unmetered) — each with an independent cap in `Limits`, enforced by `frontier()`/`tick()` at launch time (a ready node only launches if its lane has a free slot; excess stays `ready`). No template-author surface. Rationale: a foreach over local-model-heavy action nodes (embedding re-index, whisper transcription — minutes-long, proven gateway-hostile in this codebase's own ST-reindex history) must not head-of-line-block the run's LLM stages. Config: `workflows.max_concurrent_nodes` becomes per-lane (`{llm: 4, io: 2}`) with a single number accepted as a back-compat total. Kept exactly this small — pluggable scheduler strategies and preemption are the enterprise ceiling not to build.

**Active-edge convergence gating (WF2-R18):** convergence (join) nodes with multiple predecessors wait only on predecessors with an **ACTIVE edge** — an edge along an actually-taken execution path. On conditional routing (`branch`, gate routing), only the taken path's outgoing edges become active; untaken branches cannot deadlock the join. Critical subtlety: async/waiting nodes (`wait`, `gate`, long-running `stage`) register their outgoing edges as active at **wait-entry, not completion** — otherwise a 3-way fan-out with 1 fast + 2 async branches fires the merge after only the first completion. Active edges are tracked as a set of `"{src_id}->{dst_id}"` strings in run state, derived from actually-executed routing decisions, so `frontier()` stays pure. Two regression tests are acceptance criteria (Slice 11): (1) conditional branch with untaken path never deadlocks a join; (2) async fan-out with waiting branches does not fire a join prematurely. Without this, any spec combining conditional routing with convergence has a fundamental scheduler bug in one direction or the other — `needs: [sibling_ids]` alone does not address conditional paths.

**SubagentManager depth enforcement (required — genuinely NEW code):** recon confirms the current "no spawn recursion" contract is **prompt-level only** — `_SYSTEM_PREFIX` says "Do NOT create other agents" (subagent.py) and subagent sessions simply don't receive the mcp-core toolset by default; there is NO code check blocking a `subagent:` parent from spawning. Workflow stages need controlled recursion: a stage's subagent must be able to invoke `subagent_run` (single), and a `subworkflow` node spawns nested stages. Implement an explicit **depth counter** (`__wf_depth`, max 3), mirroring the existing `__hook_depth` pattern (hooks.py:721 injects it; invoke_agent_provider.py:66 reads and bounds it): stage spawns carry depth+1; a spawn at max depth gets single-`subagent_run` only (no batch, no workflow_start). This is a Slice 1 work item adding enforcement that does not exist today.

**Stage spawns are `silent=True` and run-scoped:** completions route to the run journal (never injected into a chat session — `silent` on SubagentInfo suppresses the parent-injection announce path); the parent chat sees only run-level events via the widget.

**Trigger-origin dispatch lock (WF2-R1 + batch-5):** a per-def dispatch lock ensures a schedule burst never runs the same def twice concurrently. The lock is a **DB-backed lease with a max_duration expiry** (the ProcessLock pattern — a crashed gateway mid-run cannot permanently wedge a scheduled def; the lock self-expires and the next trigger reacquires; the platform's `single_flight` fcntl locks are process-local and insufficient here). What happens to the loser is the def's explicit `on_overlap` policy: `skip` (a per-minute monitor trigger) | `queue` | `cancel_previous` (a "regenerate the report" trigger).

### Engine-Owned Completion (WF2-R3)

The maker-praises-its-own-work failure is the most consistently documented finding in the research corpus (agent-declared completion is systematically overconfident; case study 37.5%→87.5% with pass-state gating). This plan bakes the platform's existing loop-judge-independence tenet ("no agent certifies its own work" — engine-seams gotcha #1) into the engine primitive so LOOPS-EVOLUTION doesn't re-add it per template:

- **Node/gate completion is engine-gated**: a stage subagent may only REQUEST a transition; the engine executes the declared verification and flips the state irreversibly.
- **Verification ladder**: gates support an ordered ladder (static → runtime → system/e2e) with a no-skip invariant and per-criterion hard thresholds — any hard failure fails the gate, no averaging; per-criterion scores journaled as Run Ledger events.
- **`required_artifacts: [glob]`** on `stage`/`action` nodes — `frontier()` refuses completion until matching files exist in the run workspace; per-node artifact digests (path/size/sha256) recorded in the ledger. (Same shape as the loop deliverable gate + `effective_dir` symmetry lesson: the verifier reads where the worker writes.)
- **`gate.verify: {script, until: success, max_iters}`** runs a bundled deterministic validator, passing only on typed zero-error output. `verify_command` gates reuse the `loop/gates.py:run_verify_command` idiom (tristate True/False/None, `audit_bash_command` screen, 180s timeout, exit-127→None). A zero-LLM structural gate immediately after every LLM generation node is blessed as a bundled-template idiom.
- **Fresh-judge invariant**: a gate/loop-exit judging LLM output runs in a session (optionally model) distinct from producing nodes — `self_judge: true` is explicit opt-in. Judge gates emit a **closed verdict enum** (`PASS|RETRY|ESCALATE|REJECT`) so `frontier()` routes on data, never prose. (Mirrors `loop/judge.py`: judge on the "reasoning" use-case provider, no write tools, permission requests rejected.)

### Structured Output (WF2-R8)

Stage/infer `schema` enforcement is a **capability-dispatched seam**, not a hardcoded strategy: `enforcement: auto|constrained|json_mode|parse_retry` on the node. `auto` dispatches on the resolved provider's declared structured-output capability — provider-native constrained decoding for local models (Ollama `format=json-schema` now; a logits path later), parse-with-retry for API/CLI providers. Rules:

- Schemas and bindings compile/validate at **spec-save time** ("schema not enforceable on bound model" = spec validation error); compiled constraint artifacts cached per (schema, model).
- Parse-retry re-presents the schema plus the JSON parse-error location; markdown fencing is auto-stripped before `json.loads` (measured to fix most format failures with ZERO retries). Retry is implemented as **session-resume-with-error-feedback**, not blind redo; the produce-then-extract two-node idiom is the documented escape hatch. Compile-time check that the node prompt actually contains the extraction tag; tag+schema extraction is last-match-wins (self-correction is benign).
- Judge/verdict schemas put a bounded free-text `reasoning` field BEFORE the constrained verdict field.
- **Output truncation recovery** (WF2-R4 am.): phase-1 silent same-request retry at escalated max_tokens; phase-2 bounded continuation with anti-apology prompt.
- `action`/`transform` nodes get an optional declarative **`output_contract`** `{must_be_json, required_keys, max/min_length, forbidden_phrases}` validated by the engine (~0.3ms mechanical check) before the node is marked complete and before any `{{nodes.x.output}}` binding resolves — malformed output never silently propagates through the graph. Per-edge contracts fail-branch on mismatch.
- Action providers follow the **structured-with-fallback** convention: declare typed schema + render-to-canonical-markdown with stable headers; engine attempts structured, retries free-text; downstream bindings parse deterministically either way (eliminates the "LLM parses LLM output" node type).
- Orchestrating nodes get node-level tool allow/deny policy so they structurally cannot perform worker actions.

### Side Effects: Effect Ledger + Idempotency (WF2-R1)

The journal cache memoizes *outputs* only; without effect identity, resume/rewind/fork double-fire external effects (Slack send, create-task, inbox write) — the biggest correctness hole in a journaled-replay design. Every `action`-node side-effecting dispatch records in `events.jsonl`:

```
{idempotency_key: sha256(run_id + instance_path + epoch),
 effect_status: attempted|committed|retried|compensated|skipped,
 compensation_ref?}
```

Rules:
- Rewind/fork across a **committed** effect surfaces it in the mutation cascade preview (§3) instead of silently re-running; re-execution of a node with a committed effect requires explicit `redo_effects: true`.
- `workflow_start`/`workflow_edit` accept a caller idempotency key with a short-lived dedupe cache — retried chat tool calls return the existing run id.
- External-resource action providers follow the BYOI contract: stdout = one JSON object, stderr = journaled logs, paired teardown command receiving the output id, teardown required idempotent — makes rewind/fork over a provisioning region safe.
- The effect record extends the existing `ActionResult.outcome` honesty contract (`"launched"` = fire-and-forget started≠succeeded) rather than replacing it.

### Failure / Retry / Budgets (WF2-R4)

Per-stage `retry: {max_attempts: 2, amend_prompt: true}`. **Attempts are first-class journal records** typed by the failure-mode enum (§1): retry N injects a per-mode correction hint plus a pruned digest of attempts 1..N-1 into the fresh session (mutation hints resolved 7/10 failures on attempt 2 vs blind retries reproducing the same failure). Structured per-issue retry payloads `{expected, actual, evidence, fix_instruction, files, severity}` are journaled per attempt so retry loops get actionable feedback, not free prose. `no_retry_modes` (e.g. `prompt_injection`) never retry. Retry policy is mode-differentiated: retry capacity errors in blocking mode; fail-fast in background. The scheduler consults `retryable: bool` on the failure envelope, not blanket counts.

Exhausted retries → instance `failed`, output `null`. Node `on_error` policy:
- `null_continue` (default): parent sees null, keeps going
- `fail_branch`: parent parallel/foreach marks this path failed
- `fail_run`: run transitions to `failed`
- `pause_run`: run transitions to `needs_input`

When a loop node exhausts retries, the engine produces a first-class **escalation artifact** — five typed options (reassign / decompose / revise / accept-with-limitations / defer) surfaced as a needs-input gate.

**Deterministic circuit breaker (LLM-free, in `frontier()`):** pre-iteration trip conditions on loop nodes — max_iterations, same `error_signature` N consecutive (default 3), byte-identical output across M iterations, cumulative tokens — emitting the typed **`escalated`** terminal state (distinct from `failed`). Iteration ledger events carry `{iteration, outcome, error_signature, tokens}`. This catches the field's #1 autonomous-run failure mode (infinite fix loop / thrash / stall) at zero LLM cost.

**Budgets (resolves Open Question 4 — SOFT):** breach = pause resumably + ledger event + needs-input item. `budget: {max_tokens, max_cost, max_retries}` on WorkflowRun with template defaults; node-level budgets with extend-budget gates (warn ~80%, pause at cap into needs_input). Templates may declare per-item LLM-call budgets that the engine asserts and ledgers (flagging over-budget runs). Plan review shows a static estimated-LLM-calls figure derived from topology. Two resume invariants (acceptance criteria):
1. Budgets are **PRE-CHARGED from the journal on resume** — resume must not mint a fresh budget.
2. On resume/rewind the engine runs a template-declared cheap **`baseline_check`** before scheduling the frontier, injecting a repair node on failure — pre-existing breakage never gets obscured by new work.

### Timeouts (WF2-R5)

Two knobs, not one: `timeout_total` (max wall clock) + `timeout_stall` (max window with NO progress events — a long operation is fine, silence is not). Local-model-backed action providers get separate warm-up vs execute budgets (minutes-long cold starts look identical to hangs under one number). Batch-5 cautionary tale: a studied engine shipped a NO-OP node timeout that never fired, unnoticed because timeouts are only exercised under failure — so Slice 11 carries an explicit **"timeout actually fires" regression pair**: (1) a stalled stage must transition `failed(timeout_stall)` within the window; (2) a long-but-progressing node must NOT be killed by `timeout_stall`. Both knobs proven live, not decorative.

### Context Lifecycle for Long Nodes (WF2-R6)

The deep-research and audit-sweep templates are exactly the long-horizon shapes where compaction demonstrably fails (Anthropic: "compaction alone wasn't sufficient"; handoffs cut rebuild cost ~78%, hidden defects 43%→8%):

- **`session: fresh|continuous`** per-iteration policy on loop/foreach bodies (default fresh for long horizons) — each iteration writes a structured **handoff artifact** `{verified state, changes, broken/unverified, next action}` into the journal; the next fresh session reads it. Reset-vs-compact is a per-model `runtime_hint`. Rewind/fork replay the handoff correctly because it's journaled.
- **Typed carryover buckets** per long-running node (bounded, deduped: files touched with line spans, verified work, spawned children) survive executor compaction/reset — cheaper and more reliable than prose handoffs alone.
- **`decision` journal records** `{choice, reason, rejected_alternatives, constraints}` written by stage nodes — compaction keeps the "what" and drops the "why"; without these, resume/fork/rewind re-litigate settled decisions.
- **Output offloading**: node outputs over a size threshold keep head/tail in the journal and write the body to `runs/<id>/artifacts/`, reachable via `{{nodes.x.artifact}}` (measured: 4,000 lines of PASSING test output flooding context causes hallucination). Media/large outputs bind as artifact pointers (`[Artifact #id: hint]` text in bindings) with an `artifact_inspect` action (cheap-model fallback chain) to pull content on demand. Contract: "success is silent; failures are verbose."
- **Two-layer context ladder** for LLM-backed nodes: proactive compaction at ~80% of the bound model's window via a cheap summarizer, then error-triggered aggressive re-compaction before failing the node; degrade-to-drop-with-placeholder if the summarizer itself fails.

### Filesystem Write Scope (WF2-R19)

The frozen-region invariant protects spec state and the effect ledger protects external API effects — nothing else prevents a stage subagent writing or deleting files outside its intended scope (this platform already hit the failure class: the destructive-test-isolation incident deleted the user's real bound model). Stage/action nodes executing commands or spawning subagents declare `allowed_write_paths: [glob]` (default: the run workspace dir). The engine snapshots the filesystem tree (paths + mtimes + sizes) before node execution and diffs after completion. Out-of-scope writes (normalized path matching, `..` rejection, symlink resolution) flag the node **`scope_violation`** in the Run Ledger with violating paths listed, and optionally block completion (configurable: warn vs reject). Three enforcement layers documented: advisory (prompt instructs scope — all that exists today via `_SYSTEM_PREFIX` + `validate_cwd`), authoritative (engine diff detects), OS seatbelt (a future sandbox provider receives `allowed_write_paths` as policy).

### Termination Robustness (WF2-R10)

- The `CANCEL` sentinel is a **persisted sticky cancel INTENT** surviving gateway restarts mid-cancel — running children cancelled, new scheduling refused, run finalizes `cancelled` only when the frontier settles; startup orphan-reap honors pending cancel intents.
- **Terminal-write ownership**: only the RunController's tick loop writes a run's terminal status; pause/cancel HTTP/tool endpoints write *signals* the controller consumes (prevents a stop handler overwriting a failure — a documented race).
- **Completion-protocol invariant**: a stage subagent terminating without an explicit structured completion auto-transitions the node to typed `blocked{kind: protocol_violation}` feeding the needs-input surface — never a silent hang.
- **`workflow_audit`** maintenance operation with diagnose/heal semantics: scan for stale_running runs, dead gates, expired waits, lost runs (backing subagent vanished past grace), orphaned post-rewind journal keys — auto-repair with `dryRun`.

### Resume / Crash Recovery

On startup: reap orphaned runs (controller rebuild from `spec.json` + `state.json`), mark orphaned `running` instances as failed-attempt, honor sticky cancel intents, pre-charge budgets from the journal, run `baseline_check` where declared, and tick. **Journal cache**: every stage launch appends `{started, key}`; every result appends `{result, key, output_ref}` where `key = sha256(instance_path + node_spec_hash + resolved_inputs_hash + epoch)`. On resume/rewind, key hits serve cached outputs instantly. Journal epochs are additionally stamped with a hash of shape-affecting spec regions so resume/fork under a mutated spec forces re-frontier instead of silent state reuse (WF2-R2 am.). Journal cuts at epoch boundaries walk back until every retained tool_result has its tool_use — naive cuts produce API-rejected conversations on resume (WF2-R2 am.).

## 3. Mid-Flight Mutation Model

### Typed Ops (batch-applied, transactional)

| Op | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `update_node{id, fields}` | Patch node spec (prompt, schema, model_tier, etc.) |
| `insert{parent_id, index, node}` | Add a new node to a container |
| `delete{id}` | Remove a pending/skipped node from the spec |
| `move{id, new_parent, index}` | Relocate a pending node |
| `set_input{overrides}` | Override workflow input bindings |
| `skip{id}` | Mark a pending node skipped (output = null, children skipped) |
| `rewind{to_id, redo_effects?}` | Reset a done/failed node + its binding-dependency closure to pending; archive outputs + journal region; bump epoch |
| `run_from{node_id}` | **NEW (WF2-R2):** re-execute only the subgraph downstream of a node with upstream outputs pre-satisfied from the journal (prune to dependents, seed in-degrees) — the third re-entry primitive besides resume and rewind ("redo synthesis with the same gathered data") |
| `fork{checkpoint_id?, note?}` | Branch a NEW run from a checkpoint (or current state); original run + journal stay immutable. `forked_from` recorded on the child |
| `inline_subworkflow{id}` | Copy referenced def body into run spec for local editing |

**Rewind vs run_from vs fork:** three complementary re-entry semantics. `rewind` is IN-PLACE — quick fixes on a run you're steering ("redo the synthesis stage with a better prompt"). `run_from` re-runs downstream-only with upstream cache pre-satisfied. `fork` is BRANCHING — exploratory divergence where the original result must be preserved. Fork copies the spec + state at the checkpoint into a new run dir; the journal cache is shared read-only up to the fork point (cache keys match), so a fork is cheap. Fork must explicitly state which axes it isolates and force per-fork disambiguation (distinct branch/dir, randomness in unique-name generators) for non-isolated axes (WF2-R2 am.).

### Re-Entry Semantics: Binding-Dependency Cascade (WF2-R2)

The rev-1 spec reset "X + all descendants" — **tree** descendants — but data flows through `{{nodes.<id>.output}}` bindings: a later *sibling* binding X's output is NOT a tree descendant and would keep a stale input, a guaranteed silently-inconsistent-run bug class. Corrected semantics:

1. `rewind` (and `update_node`/`set_input`) compute the closure over the **binding-dependency graph**, not the container tree.
2. Every mutation batch returns an engine-computed **cascade preview** ("what re-runs / what stays", cost-tiered) — cascades that re-run completed stages require explicit confirmation; committed external effects in the cascade are surfaced (§2 Effect Ledger).
3. Done nodes with changed inputs *outside* the confirmed re-run set get a journaled `inputs_stale` flag.
4. **Inputs-hash memoization**: journal keys carry an inputs-hash tier — a cascaded node whose `(node_spec_hash, resolved_inputs_hash)` is unchanged replays its cached output instead of re-running; epoch bump is reserved for explicit force (`--force` semantics). A rewind that doesn't change a node's inputs shouldn't re-run it.
5. Rewind archives the superseded journal region alongside outputs (`journal/attic/v<NNN>/`).
6. Rewind splits into **rollback** (hard reset with preserved forward refs) vs **revert** (inverse-patch one node's effects; 409-with-conflict-named on overlapping later state), both behind the mandatory preview.

### Safety Protocol

1. **Single-writer conductor:** all mutations enter a queue; the controller drains one batch at a time between scheduling steps (never mid-node-launch).
2. **Frozen-region invariant:** ops targeting done/running nodes reject (except `rewind`/`run_from` which explicitly unfreeze). Pending/skipped/waiting nodes are mutable.
3. **TOCTOU re-verify (WF2-R2 am.):** content revision is re-verified AFTER user approval and immediately BEFORE applying any mutation op — the frozen-region check alone has a time-of-check gap while nodes complete under the preview.
4. **Validation:** after ops apply, the full spec is re-validated (acyclic, bindings resolvable, type checks, branch case coverage). Invalid batch → rollback, error to chat.
5. **Epoch bump on forced rewind:** rewound nodes get a new epoch; journal cache keys include the epoch, so old results are invalidated and re-execution is forced. Old outputs move to `outputs/attic/v<NNN>/`.
6. **Spec history:** every accepted batch appends `spec_history/v<NNN>.json` with `{ops, actor (chat|user|cron), ts, resulting_spec_hash}` — full audit trail.
7. **Optimistic concurrency for chat tools:** `expect_version` param on mutation tools; version mismatch → retry with fresh state.

### Mutation Grammar Hardening (WF2-R20)

The ops above are designed for engine correctness; these rules address the specific ways LLMs fail at *producing* them (broad coordinate guesses, two mutations per block, stale-state edits):

- (a) Ops use unique-anchor identification (`node_id`) XOR positional identification (`parent_id + index`) — never mixed in one batch.
- (b) No overlapping edits: two ops targeting the same node in one batch = batch rejection with diagnostic.
- (c) Ops apply in coordinate-preserving order (insertions/deletes in reverse-index order so earlier indices stay valid).
- (d) Common LLM aliases in node-kind and field names are tolerated via a canonical-form normalization layer.
- (e) **Atomic failure contract**: a rejected batch writes NOTHING — prior spec remains source of truth, no partial application.
- (f) Chat tools enforce **staged turns**: inspect/status ops end the tool turn, and a rendered+source echo of the current spec lands in the model's transient context for the next mutation turn — the model mutates what it just SAW, not what it remembers.

## 4. Chat Tool Surface

### Tool List

| Tool Name | Description | Key Params |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_author` | Author/save a workflow definition directly (DAG spec) — the low-level authoring tool | `name, description, inputs, nodes (tree spec), save: bool` |
| `workflow_plan` | Plan-first entry: generate a spec from a natural-language goal (template-aware; see UNIVERSAL-PLANNING) — returns a plan artifact + approval gate before anything runs | `goal, rigor?: minimal\|standard\|deep, template?` |
| `workflow_list_defs` | List available workflow definitions (user + bundled templates) | `tag?, source?` |
| `workflow_get_def` | Retrieve a workflow definition in full | `name` |
| `workflow_start` | Start a workflow run (instantiate a def with inputs) | `name, inputs, mode: blocking\|background, idempotency_key?` |
| `workflow_status` | Get current run status + node-level progress | `run_id` |
| `workflow_observe` | **NEW (WF2-R11):** subscribe-briefly — timestamped event deliveries from a bounded window (clamped duration); cheaper and safer than status-polling loops in chat | `run_id, duration_ms` |
| `workflow_edit` | Mid-flight edit: apply mutation ops to unexecuted stages; returns the cascade preview when confirmation is needed | `run_id, ops[], expect_version, idempotency_key?, confirm_cascade?` |
| `workflow_skip` | Skip one or more pending nodes | `run_id, node_ids[]` |
| `workflow_rewind` | Rewind to a node in place (re-execute it and its binding dependents) | `run_id, node_id, redo_effects?` |
| `workflow_run_from` | Re-execute only the subgraph downstream of a node (upstream cache pre-satisfied) | `run_id, node_id` |
| `workflow_fork` | Branch a new run from a checkpoint; original immutable | `run_id, checkpoint_id?, note?` |
| `workflow_pause` | Pause a running workflow (in-flight nodes finish, no new launches) | `run_id` |
| `workflow_resume` | Resume a paused/needs_input workflow; `answer` supports `approve / reject / revise{step_ref, comment} / input{...}`; answers consumed atomically (§5) | `run_id, gate_id?, answer?` |
| `workflow_cancel` | Cancel a run (sticky intent; in-flight agents killed) | `run_id` |
| `workflow_output` | Retrieve a specific node's structured output (or artifact pointer) | `run_id, node_id` |
| `workflow_audit` | Diagnose/heal maintenance sweep: stale runs, dead gates, expired waits, lost runs, orphaned journal keys | `dry_run: bool` |
| `workflow_manifest` | Emit node taxonomy / pipes / mutation-op catalog GENERATED from the real registries (single source of truth, CI drift-tested) | — |
| `workflow_delete_def` | Delete a workflow definition | `name` |

19 tools. Naming note: `workflow_plan` (NL goal → reviewed plan) and `workflow_author` (spec in → def saved) are deliberately separate tools — the earlier draft overloaded `workflow_plan` with both contracts, which the design review flagged as a semantic clash.

### Spec Ingestion Validation (WF2-R12)

LLM-generated specs are a first-class path (`workflow_plan`, `workflow_author`, `workflow_edit`); ingestion is engineered for it:

- **Never-throw parsing**: a structural pass that cannot throw, plus a schema mapper accumulating typed issues `{path, code, message}` on warning/error channels. Stable append-only error codes (`ERR_UNKNOWN_NODE`, `ERR_MISSING_BINDING`, `ERR_FROZEN_REGION`, …) formatted for LLM re-prompting with did-you-mean suggestions.
- **`strict` mode** (unknown node kinds, unbound bindings = hard errors) — strict compile is what makes agent-generated specs converge within ~3 repair attempts instead of silently mis-executing.
- **Dry-run before save**: agent-side def-save requires a sandbox dry run first (bindings resolve, actions validate, zero external effects); defs record `provenance` actor (chat|user) — the personal-scale reframe of the propose/create split, keeping run-start approval as already planned.
- Validation returns the Kahn-derived level-grouped execution order (plan review + widget get parallelism lanes for free; cycles are create-time errors).
- **Run-start preflight** blocks on missing credentials/binaries (from `metadata.requirements`) instead of degrading at node 7. Model preflight uses the backend `can_resolve_use_case` probe (provider_bridge.py:672 — the cheap no-instantiate check behind onboarding `needs_model`); note `capableModels` is a *frontend* function (web ModelsPanel.tsx) and cannot serve backend preflight.
- **`workflow_manifest`** is generated from the real node/pipe/op registries with a CI drift test (the manifest-vs-UI bug class this codebase keeps refinding); the graph-spec `spec_semver` follows additive-minor rules with unknown-field-tolerant readers; bundled templates get structural contract tests.

### Prompt Injection (LLM guidance)

The model receives a `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` context block (replacing the old `[PREFERRED WORKFLOW …]` injection) listing any running workflows in the current session with their status + the next action needed. This gives the LLM awareness without requiring explicit status polls. Injection lives in `context.py:build_message` and must keep the never-break-a-turn contract the old surfacing honored (swallow-all → None; the old path ran via thread-pool loop-bridges inside sync build_message).

---

## 5. Events + Live Widget

### Event Delivery (recon-corrected)

Engine events are delivered on **two channels, matching the loop pattern** — NOT via `state.notify(...)`, which is the user-notification gate behind `notification_allowed` (mute-all / severity / quiet-hours) and would silently eat engine events:

1. **Per-run SSE**: a `SseRegistry` keyed `workflow:<run_id>` registered on `DashboardState` (exactly like `loop_sse()` at dashboard/state.py:1056, served by the loop's `GET /api/loops/{id}/stream` idiom) → `GET /api/workflows/runs/{id}/stream`. This is the widget/detail-page live channel.
2. **Multiplexed WS** `_broadcast` for coarse dashboard refetch signals (`workflow_run_update` as a refetch SIGNAL, per the DashboardLive convention that WS envelopes are signals, not payloads).

`state.notify(...)` is used ONLY for genuinely user-facing moments (needs_input surfacing, run failed) where the notification gate SHOULD apply.

**FE registration requirement (recon fact):** EventSource silently DROPS unregistered event types. Every workflow SSE event type below MUST be added to the registered lifecycle union in `web/src/pages/loops/useRunStream.ts` (`RUN_LIFECYCLE`, currently the complete 22-event loop union) — or, if the widget ships its own `useWorkflowStream` hook, to an equivalent exhaustive `WORKFLOW_LIFECYCLE` union with the same must-register rule and a test asserting backend-emitted types ⊆ the FE union. Omission = silent event loss, no error.

| Event | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_run_update` | `{run_id, status, spec_version}` | On any status change (WS refetch signal + SSE) |
| `workflow_node_started` | `{run_id, node_id, instance_path, epoch}` | Node begins execution |
| `workflow_node_progress` | `{run_id, node_id, item_index?, item_total?, item_label?, stage?}` | Per-item foreach progress ("[3/12] label", WF2-R5) + stall-clock feed |
| `workflow_node_done` | `{run_id, node_id, status, degraded_reason?, output_preview}` | Node reaches terminal |
| `workflow_attention` | `{run_id, node_id, kind, ask (typed payload), resume_token}` | Gate/blocker/needs_input |
| `workflow_mutation` | `{run_id, ops[], new_version}` | Spec edited mid-flight |

### Event Pipeline Correctness (WF2-R11)

The live widget is the plan's primary UX surface, and rewind/fork make it uniquely vulnerable to stale/duplicate/out-of-order updates — this codebase already fought exactly this bug class in the chat stream (the K42/K44/K45 coalescer bugs):

- **Explicit dedup key**: `run_id|node_id|epoch|seq|state`; event ids are deterministic at emit time (`{run_id}-evt-{offset}`) so re-emits are idempotent no-ops. The snapshot-vs-delta streaming contract is specified (full text replaces, delta appends, optional replace flag).
- **Event-fold law** (formal invariant): a pure fold of run events EXACTLY reconstructs run state — the FE fold gets the same treatment as `runFold.ts` (pure, unit-locked). Interrupt semantics journal synthesized `interrupted` results for all pending calls on rewind/cancel; a run-admission registry distinguishes droppable wake events from must-requeue gate-answer resumes.
- **Snapshot-then-subscribe**: on mount, the widget fetches the server-canonical snapshot BEFORE subscribing to deltas; sequence-numbered replay on reconnect from a per-run buffer is an acceptance criterion; every async emission is epoch-tagged and dropped if superseded (protects rewind/fork). Events are node-id-keyed patches, not full `nodes_summary[]` rebroadcasts.
- **Coalesced delivery (batch-5)**: per-observer dirty-version tracking with debounced push scheduling (~25ms) and burst coalescing sits between the event fold and the SSE write — a 20-node parallel fan-out completing in one tick produces ONE coalesced widget update per connection, not 20 broadcasts (directly addresses the §9 large-spec widget risk). The snapshot projection is schema-validated before transmission so a malformed projection can never corrupt the widget.
- **Oversized outputs**: a `result_omitted` spill-to-artifact-path pattern at the journal boundary (magic-prefix binary detection, byte counts in the stub) — the same ~64KB sanitizer boundary that protects live chat applies to journaled node outputs.
- **Replay regression harness** (Slice 11): recorded JSONL traces for required scenarios (happy-path, restart-during-run, rewind-during-stream, network-degraded); compute duplicate_event_rate / event_fanout_ratio / order-violations / p95 offline; CI-gated against a checked-in baseline with hard + relative-drift thresholds.
- **Streamed previews** are keyed by `(run_id, epoch, node_id)`; on run termination only that run+epoch's pending updates flush (prevents the one-global-slot overwrite bug class) (WF2-R13 am.).

### Run Ledger (acceptance criteria — required by the Learning Flywheel plan)

The `events.jsonl` journal MUST record these learning-relevant events in structured form (not just replay/debug data). The downstream template-refiner (LEARNING-FLYWHEEL plan §run-outcomes) is starved without them:

| Ledger Event | Required Fields |
|---|---|
| `step_completed` | `node_id, instance_path, duration_secs, tokens, retries, model, provider, cost_usd (backend-authoritative, rate-table floor), degraded_reason?, resolved_prompt_ref` |
| `step_failed` | `node_id, error, failure_signature {failing_node, stage, layer, reason, input_hash}, attempt, retries_exhausted: bool` |
| `step_skipped` | `node_id, actor (user\|chat\|engine)` |
| `gate_rejected` | `node_id, user_comment (verbatim)` |
| `gate_criterion` | `node_id, criterion, score, hard_fail: bool` (WF2-R3 ladder scores) |
| `effect` | `idempotency_key, effect_status, compensation_ref?` (WF2-R1) |
| `iteration` | `node_id, iteration, outcome, error_signature, tokens` (WF2-R4 breaker feed) |
| `user_edited_mid_flight` | `ops[] (the structured mutation batch, not a diff blob)` |
| `consulted` | `node_id, ref (skill/template actually loaded, distinct from injected-into-prompt)` — evolution attribution (WF2-R13) |
| `child_run_attach` | `parent_run_id, child_run_id, node_id` (WF2-R13) |
| `run_abandoned` | `at_node_id, elapsed_secs` |
| `crystallized` | `digest {narrative, decisions, outcomes, artifacts, lessons}` (WF2-R13, pre-prune) |

These are engine-emission requirements, not a separate store — the refiner reads `events.jsonl` filtered to this subset. Per-stage instances journal the **fully-resolved post-binding prompt** (or a content ref) for trajectory replay and forensics. **Acceptance criterion — reasoning-path reconstructability**: from ledger events alone one must be able to replay prompt → tool invocations → final output per node; one record shape serves the cockpit, overnight-runs inbox, flywheel evaluator, and failure forensics (WF2-R13 am.). Pass-rate / failure-distribution / P50-P99 become ledger queries.

### Human-Input Contract (WF2-R7)

Turns `needs_input` from a chat-only prompt into a durable cross-surface primitive — the linchpin for WORK-CONTAINERS' needs-input inbox and AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's unattended runs:

- **Typed ask payload**: `{kind: approval|choice|text|form, fields (typed, with defaults), prompt, timeout, unattended_suppress}` — one FE renderer covers every human-input node; the payload projects into the needs-input inbox as a real form.
- **Mode-dependent timeouts**: background-mode gates time out short (config ~30-60s) emitting a distinct `timed_out_unattended` event + needs-input surfacing; blocking/chat mode waits long. Otherwise background runs wedge on approvals.
- **Durable resume tokens + continuation records (batch-5)**: each needs_input transition persists a journaled **continuation record** `{node_id, instance_path, resolved_inputs, epoch, expires_at}` actionable from widget/inbox/API hours later — resume re-enters that exact step with its resolved-so-far inputs rather than re-executing the enclosing subgraph; completed progress preserved. Expiry produces a typed `resume_expired` needs-input item (offer re-run from node), never a silent dead token.
- **Atomic answers**: answers are consumed atomically (one-shot row deleted in the resume transaction) so double-resume can't replay them.
- **Handoff bundle**: pause/needs_input/checkpoint persist `{scope+status, outstanding items, checks run, next steps, risks}` — rendered by the widget when blocked.
- **Any action node may return a clarification request** → run pauses into needs_input and surfaces to the inbox, without template authors pre-placing gate nodes.
- **Remote-channel gates**: owner binding (only the run's requester can approve from a shared channel; non-owner replies ignored) + configurable timeout with default-DENY. Out-of-band reply paths (chat tool AND HTTP) so approvals work without the widget open.
- **"Always allow"** remember option scoped to (operation type + target), run-scoped, cleared on rewind, feeding run policy. **Auto-approve mode** for trigger-fired/scheduled runs where only destructive/high-risk gates still block (this resolves the unattended half of Open Question 2).
- **Transient-hold event gates**: `gate{kind: event}` does NOT consume the trigger event when a prerequisite is absent — bounded retry counter, loud give-up — distinguishing prerequisite-absent from input-invalid (a gate that eats its wake-up event then fails loses the event).

### Chat Widget — `WorkflowProgressCard.tsx`

Mirrors `SdlcProgressCard.tsx` pattern (which is REST-polling, not stream-driven — recon):
- **Detection:** tool segment detector recognizes `workflow_start` tool output containing a `/#/workflows/<run_id>` deep link — same regex-over-tool-output contract as `sdlcRefFromTool` (SdlcProgressCard.tsx:35); wired in ChatPage's renderItem the same way (done ToolSegment → card instead of ToolCard; kept out of the collapsed work fold).
- **Rendering:** the node tree IS the widget tree — each node is a row with status icon (pending/running/done/degraded/failed/skipped/escalated), label, elapsed time, remediation line on failure (distinct from the error — WF2-R5). Containers are collapsible groups; foreach rows render per-item progress ("[3/12] label"). Active nodes pulse; the frontier is highlighted. `branch` nodes render only the taken path expanded.
- **Live data:** REST snapshot poll (4s while LIVE statuses, 10s otherwise, stop on terminal — cadence read from the JUST-FETCHED status, the stale-closure fix) + the per-run SSE for deltas on the detail page. Snapshot-then-subscribe on mount (§ Event Pipeline).
- **Controls:** pause/resume/cancel inline (controllable mode); two-step armed delete for terminal runs; "Open in Workflows" deep link.
- **Attention banner:** when `needs_input`, renders the typed ask payload as a real inline form (approval/choice/text/form kinds) — same attention pattern as SdlcProgressCard, upgraded from string question to typed payload.

### Blocking vs Background Mode

| Mode | Behavior | Widget |
|---|---|---|
| **Background** | Chat continues; widget lives in the message stream as a persistent card (like loop cards today) | Polls and renders live; user can interact with other tools |
| **Blocking** | The tool call doesn't return until the run completes (or needs_input/fails) | Widget renders live during the tool's execution; chat is blocked until complete |

Blocking mode is implemented by `await run_controller.wait_for_terminal()` inside the tool handler (with periodic progress events emitted so the FE widget updates). Background mode creates the run, returns the deep-link immediately, and the widget polls independently. Retry policy is mode-differentiated (§2).

## 6. Batteries-Included Templates

Shipped as `bundled/<name>/workflow.json` (mtime-synced on boot, same as the old bundled SOP pattern):

| Template | Structure |
|---|---|
| `deep-research` | `infer(triage tier)` → `branch` → `loop{until_dry}` over: `parallel[multi-modal-search, web-fetch]` → `transform(dedup)` → `foreach(sources, pipeline){read, extract, verify}` → `transform(synthesize)` |
| `project-planning` | `sequence[understand-scope, parallel[research-domain, audit-codebase], design-approach, plan-milestones, review-plan]` |
| `code-implementation` | `sequence[action(baseline-capture), plan, foreach(files, pipeline){implement, test, lint}, gate(verify_command), integration-test, stage(commit-review)]` |
| `design-review` | `parallel[infer(feasibility-judge), infer(ux-judge), infer(correctness-judge)]` → `transform(synthesize scores)` → `stage(final-recommendation)` |
| `audit-sweep` | `parallel[finders...]` → `transform(dedup)` → `foreach(findings, pipeline){verify, fix}` → `stage(completeness-critic)` → `loop{until_dry}` |
| `produce-and-audit` | **NEW (WF2-R15):** domain-neutral — research → produce artifact → read-only QC gate with severity-tiered Finding records |

Users can instantiate a template, edit it (including mid-flight), or create their own from scratch via chat or UI.

### Conventions Pack (WF2-R15 — template work, not engine work)

Cross-template conventions that keep a 6+ template library effective and maintainable:

- **Triage-first**: a blessed opening pattern — an `infer` classification node whose output (`{{nodes.triage.output.tier}}`) drives a `branch` selecting among 2-3 entry subgraphs (avoids over-processing small tasks), plus an escalate-and-reclassify convention (typed mutation splicing skipped stages back in). Converges with the classifier-then-dispatch shape (WF2-R17 batch-5) recommended for ingestion-flavored templates.
- **Canonical Finding record**: `{severity: Critical|Major|Minor|Nit, location, problem, why, recommended_fix, status: Open|Fixed|Needs-decision}` as the output contract of ALL review/judge stages — gate predicates like "no open Critical|Major" become uniform, the widget renders findings identically everywhere, and the Run Ledger is minable by the flywheel.
- **Baseline capture**: code-flavored templates run an `action(run_validation)` node before the first mutating node; its journaled output later gates diffs to classify regression vs pre-existing vs implementation-detail (pairs with the engine `baseline_check` resume invariant, §2).
- **Shared prompt-block library** (`bundled/shared/`): preflight, graduated safety tiers, conventions — referenced from template specs instead of duplicated text; rule "repeated boilerplate moves to shared" + a deterministic template-lint so refs can't drift.
- **Steering examples**: template metadata `steering_examples: [{event, description}]` (kickoff + mid-flight mutation examples) surfaced in the widget and fed to `workflow_plan` as few-shot.
- **`artifact_update` action provider**: dashboard-style templates generate an HTML skeleton once and refresh it via pure transforms re-binding `{{nodes.x.output}}` slots. This is a NEW action provider → registered in the action_providers registry AND added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555) — see §7.5.

---

## 7. Clean-Break / Namespace-Reuse Plan

### Phase 0: Relocate shared code trapped in the old feature

1. Move `prompt_render` tool from `mcp_workflows.py` → `mcp_prompts.py` (new file, same pattern).
2. Move `resolve_agent_id` from `workflows/composition.py:195` → `agents/identity.py` (imported by `chat_runner.py`).
3. Verify no other consumer of `_CURRENT_AGENT_ID` contextvar (mcp_core.py:84) outside workflow-create; if clean, keep it in `mcp_core.py` for the new feature.

### Phase 1: Delete the old feature entirely

Backend (delete whole files):
- `Gideon/src/gideon/workflows/` (entire package: `__init__.py`, `models.py`, `provider.py`, `native.py`, `registry.py`, `composition.py`, `surfacing.py`, `handlers.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `bundled/` starter SOPs) — **except** the provider-registry seam is REPLACED, not orphaned (see below)
- `Gideon/src/gideon/mcp_workflows.py` (after prompt_render relocated)
- `Gideon/src/gideon/action_providers/run_workflow_provider.py`
- `Gideon/src/gideon/apps/native/native-workflows/`
- `Gideon/src/gideon/apps/native/gideon-workflows/`
- `Gideon/src/gideon/apps/native/run-workflow-action/`

**Provider-type continuity (recon-corrected):** the extension registry's `workflow` `_TypeHandler` (providers/registry.py) currently registers app-contributed providers into `workflows/registry.py`, and manifest `PROVIDER_TYPES` MUST equal the runtime type-handler set (guarded by `test_manifest_types_match_handlers` — the #47 bug class: an unregistered type blocks reinstall/update of any app declaring it). Deleting `workflows/registry.py` without repointing would break both. The new feature ships a v2 def-provider registry (`workflows/defs.py` exposes `register_provider`; a `WorkflowDefProvider` ABC = read/list defs, optional write) and the `workflow` _TypeHandler is **repointed** at it in the same commit that deletes the old registry — apps can then contribute workflow-def packs (template libraries) exactly the way they contribute task/search/prompt providers today.

Backend (surgical edits):
- `context.py`: remove `force_workflow_ids` param + workflow-surfacing block in `build_message` (the `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` injection lands in the same spot in Slice 6)
- `dashboard/chat_runner.py`: remove `_force_workflow_ids`, `force_workflow_ids` kwarg, workflow-related agent_id helper
- `dashboard/server.py`: remove `with_session_workflow_cleanup` composition + `register_workflow_routes` call
- `dashboard/handlers/loop_routes.py`: remove `workflow_ids` from loop-create body + capability catalog workflow half
- `validation.py`: remove `_WORKFLOW_SCOPES`, all `WORKFLOW_*_SCHEMA`, workflow entries in `MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS`, `"run-workflow"` in `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (re-added for the v2 run-workflow action in Slice 3)
- `mcp_core.py`: remove `mcp_workflows` from `_AGGREGATED_CATEGORY_MODULES` (mcp_core.py:918)
- `fs_watch.py`: remove the old workflow dir from `default_config_roots` (re-added for the new `defs/` layout in Slice 0)

Frontend (delete):
- `Gideon/web/src/pages/workflows/` (entire directory: `WorkflowCreatePage.tsx`, `WorkflowDetail.tsx`, `WorkflowForm.tsx`, `WorkflowsListPage.tsx`, `WorkflowsSection.tsx`, `workflowDag.ts`, `workflowMeta.ts`)

Frontend (surgical edits):
- `app/App.tsx`: remove old workflow route imports + entries (lazy import, `NAV` entry, `renderPage` case)
- `lib/api.ts`: remove old workflow API methods + `WorkflowItem`/`WorkflowGraph` types
- `lib/agents.ts`: remove the workflow comment reference (trivial)
- Nav config: remove old workflows nav entry (will be re-added by new feature)

Tests (delete):
- `test_run_workflow_action.py`, `test_workflow_list_tool.py`, `test_workflows_api.py`, `test_workflows_composition.py`, `test_workflows_evolve.py`, `test_workflows_injection.py`, `test_workflows_native.py`, `test_workflows_surfacing.py`

Config:
- The `workflows.*` config namespace is reused by the new feature (different schema); the old keys (`workflows.enabled`, `workflows.match_threshold` — default 0.62, loader.py:1052; NOT 0.55, which is the skills surfacing threshold) are replaced by new ones.
- User data at `~/.gideon/workflows/` is migrated: old `<name>/WORKFLOW.md` dirs are archived to `~/.gideon/workflows/_legacy_sops/` (non-destructive; the user can read them but the new feature ignores them).

### Phase 2: Build the new feature (implementation slices below)

---

## 7.5 Provider-Architecture Integration (where each new piece plugs in)

Every new capability plugs in the way existing ones do — no bespoke seams:

| New piece | Plugs in via |
|---|---|
| Chat tool module `mcp_workflows.py` (new) | tool-category module exposing `_list_tools`/`_call_tool`, listed in `mcp_core._AGGREGATED_CATEGORY_MODULES` (mcp_core.py:918); param schemas in `validation.py` `MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS` |
| v2 `run-workflow` action provider (hooks/triggers start runs) | `action_providers` registry (`register_action_provider`) + name added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555) — omission means hook_create rejects it even though the UI offers it |
| `artifact_update` action provider (WF2-R15) | same two-step registration as above |
| App-contributed workflow-def packs | manifest `provider: {type: "workflow", implementation: "module:factory"}` → the repointed `workflow` `_TypeHandler` → the v2 def-provider registry; `PROVIDER_TYPES` ↔ handler parity preserved (test_manifest_types_match_handlers) |
| `infer` node model calls | `one_shot_completion` on the reasoning axis (plain ModelProvider — never the NativeAgentRuntime that chat/code_tools resolution returns); tier→model resolution threads the `model` build kwarg (register_entry raises on dup — never re-register) |
| Stage subagents | `SubagentManager.spawn` unchanged contract + the NEW `__wf_depth` counter (mirrors `__hook_depth`), `silent=True`, run-scoped on_done |
| Gate `verify_command` | `loop/gates.py` idiom: `audit_bash_command` screen, tristate result |
| Config: `workflows.{enabled, max_active_runs, max_concurrent_nodes (per-lane), default_effort, default_node_timeout_total_secs, default_node_timeout_stall_secs, model_tiers, retention.*, gate_timeout_unattended_secs}` | ALL FOUR wiring points: (a) `WorkflowsConfig` dataclass fields with `_meta(label, help)` (schema tests enforce reachability; `model_tiers` as a dict field or `list[dataclass]` needs per-element `_meta`), (b) `AppConfig.load()` explicit field mapping, (c) `to_dict()`, (d) PATCH `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` (+ FE `patchConfig`) for runtime-editable keys |
| Run events | per-run `SseRegistry` on `DashboardState` (loop_sse pattern) + WS `_broadcast` refetch signals; FE registration in the useRunStream.ts lifecycle union (mandatory — EventSource drops unregistered types) |
| Secrets | credential store (`save_credential` / `.env` 0600) via `{{secret:KEY}}`; RedactingSink reuses `security.redact()` |
| Untrusted-input lint | `fence_untrusted` (security.py / `sdk.security`) |
| Backup/restore | new `workflows` component in `snapshot.VALID_COMPONENTS` + `portability.py` export/import (neither covers workflows today) |
| Def files | `fs_watch.default_config_roots` gains the `defs/` dir |

**Memory vs knowledge boundary:** everything this plan persists (journal, ledger, crystallized digests, decision records, handoffs) is **engine/run state** feeding the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL memory work. Nothing here writes to the knowledge store (`knowledge.db`) or uses `knowledge_*` names — knowledge remains the user's personal items (documents, files, photos, notes).

## 8. Phased Implementation Slices

Each slice is independently shippable and testable. Rev-2 scope grows the estimate honestly from 17 to **31 sessions**.

### Slice 0: Scaffold + Data Model + Store + Bindings (est. 3 sessions)
- Create `Gideon/src/gideon/workflows/` package (fresh) after Phase 0/1.
- `models.py` (WorkflowDef incl. spec_semver/metadata/on_overlap, WorkflowRun incl. genealogy/intent/budget, full Node taxonomy incl. `infer` + `branch`, RunStatus, InstanceState incl. extended outcomes, failure taxonomy dataclasses), `store.py` (SQLite run store, WAL, `(root_run_id, status)` index, same idiom as loop store), `defs.py` (def CRUD on filesystem, fs-watch registration, bundled sync, v2 def-provider registry + repointed `workflow` _TypeHandler).
- `bindings.py`: grammar, resolver, pipe functions incl. sanitization pipes, typed BindingError, two resolution paths (whole-value vs interpolated), untrusted-origin lint (WF2-R9).
- Spec-ingestion validator core (WF2-R12): never-throw structural pass, typed issue accumulation, stable error codes, strict mode, Kahn level-grouping, branch case-coverage check.
- Config wiring: all keys through the FOUR points (§7.5) incl. per-lane `max_concurrent_nodes` + `model_tiers` slot map.
- Unit tests: model serialization, store CRUD, binding resolution + BindingError + type-preservation, validator error codes.

### Slice 1: Pure Frontier Core + Engine (est. 4 sessions)
- `tick.py`: `frontier()` pure function — incl. **active-edge join gating** (WF2-R18: active-edge set in run state, wait-entry activation) and **typed executor lanes** (WF2-R21: llm/io/compute caps in `Limits`).
- `controller.py`: `RunController` with lock, task management, lifecycle transitions, terminal-write ownership (only tick loop writes terminal status — WF2-R10).
- `engine.py`: node dispatchers (stage → SubagentManager.spawn; infer → one_shot_completion with tier resolution; branch → binding eval + active-edge record; transform → binding eval + output_contract; action → action-provider; wait/gate → state update).
- SubagentManager `__wf_depth` counter (max 3; genuinely NEW enforcement — today's block is prompt-only); stage spawns `silent=True` + run-scoped completion routing.
- `WorkflowRun.project_id` threading via `projects.resolve_project_id()`; genealogy propagation (root_run_id, spawned_by_node_id, branch_key).
- `watchdog.py`: `WorkflowWatchdog` 5s poll, server-startup registration.
- `journal.py` (epoch + inputs-hash keyed resume cache; spec-region-hash stamping; dangling-tool-result-safe cuts) + Run Ledger emission (§5 table incl. per-node model/provider/cost + resolved-prompt refs).
- Resume/crash recovery: orphan reap, sticky cancel intent honor, budget pre-charge. Retention pruning (per-def cap + origin TTL + pinned + crystallize-before-prune + deletion sweep contract). Per-def dispatch lease + `on_overlap` policy.
- Property tests: `frontier()` determinism, idempotence, frozen-region, lane caps, active-edge (both WF2-R18 regression cases).
- Integration test: simple sequence of 2 stages → completion.

### Slice 2: Outcome Model + Engine-Owned Completion + Resilience (est. 3 sessions)
- Extended outcome states (degraded, escalated, no_change, scope_violation, blocked{protocol_violation}) threaded through state/journal/ledger (WF2-R5, R10).
- Engine-gated transitions + verification ladder + `required_artifacts` gates + `gate.verify{script}` + fresh-judge invariant + closed verdict enum (WF2-R3).
- Typed attempt records + mutation-hint retries + structured retry payloads + escalation artifact + circuit breaker in frontier() (WF2-R4).
- Budgets: run/node soft caps, extend-budget gates, pre-charge invariant, baseline_check hook, topology-derived call estimate (WF2-R4).
- Two-knob timeouts (total + stall; progress events feed the stall clock) + warm-up/execute split for local-model actions (WF2-R5).
- foreach `on_item_error` + per-item checkpointing + per-item progress events (WF2-R5).

### Slice 3: Side Effects + Scope + Termination + Secrets (est. 2 sessions)
- Effect ledger: idempotency keys, effect_status records, redo_effects gate, caller idempotency-key dedupe on start/edit, BYOI teardown contract (WF2-R1).
- v2 `run-workflow` action provider + registration in `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`.
- Write-scope enforcement: pre/post fs-tree diff, normalized matching, scope_violation ledgering, warn-vs-reject config (WF2-R19).
- Termination: sticky CANCEL intent, protocol-violation auto-transition, `workflow_audit` diagnose/heal (WF2-R10).
- Secrets: `{{secret:KEY}}` resolution, `_has*` stripping/re-injection on GET/save, fork credential copy, RedactingSink on journal/events, inline-secret spec lint (WF2-R14).

### Slice 4: Mid-Flight Mutation + Checkpoints + Fork (est. 3 sessions)
- `mutations.py`: op types incl. `run_from`, batch validator, spec-history writer, epoch/inputs-hash logic.
- Binding-dependency cascade closure + engine-computed cascade preview + inputs_stale flags + rollback-vs-revert split + TOCTOU re-verify (WF2-R2).
- Mutation queue in `RunController` (drain between scheduling steps); grammar hardening rules a-f incl. atomic failure contract + alias normalization (WF2-R20).
- Rewind: archive outputs + journal region, epoch bump on force, memoized replay on unchanged inputs, frontier recompute. Skip: subtree skipped, output null.
- Checkpoints + `fork` op: new run from checkpoint, `forked_from` + root_run_id provenance, shared read-only journal prefix, fork-axis disambiguation.
- Property tests: rewind idempotence, cascade = binding closure (NOT tree descendants), no frozen-node mutation, acyclicity preserved, fork isolation, effect-crossing preview.

### Slice 5: Human-Input Contract + Gates (est. 2 sessions)
- Typed ask payload model + mode-dependent gate timeouts + `timed_out_unattended` (WF2-R7).
- Continuation records + durable resume tokens + expiry → `resume_expired`; atomic answer consumption; handoff bundle.
- Action-node clarification → needs_input path; auto-approve policy for trigger-origin runs; owner binding + default-DENY for remote-channel gates; "always allow" run-scoped memory.
- `gate{kind: event}` transient-hold semantics (one-shot trigger integration).

### Slice 6: Chat Tools + Spec Ingestion + Prompt Injection (est. 3 sessions)
- `mcp_workflows.py` (new): all 19 tools (§4) incl. `workflow_observe`, `workflow_run_from`, `workflow_audit`, `workflow_manifest`; `workflow_plan` ships template-unaware v1 (template-aware planner lands in UNIVERSAL-PLANNING).
- Wire into `_AGGREGATED_CATEGORY_MODULES`; validation schemas in `validation.py`.
- Ingestion: strict mode + repromptable errors on author/plan/edit; dry-run-before-save; provenance actor; run-start preflight (credentials/binaries from metadata.requirements + `can_resolve_use_case` model probe); manifest generated from registries + CI drift test.
- Staged-turn contract for mutation tools (WF2-R20f).
- `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` context block in `context.py:build_message` (never-break-a-turn).
- Blocking-mode handler: `await controller.wait_for_terminal()` with progress events.
- Integration test: chat session creates a workflow, starts it, edits a pending node with cascade preview, inspects output.

### Slice 7: HTTP API + FE List/Detail Pages (est. 2 sessions)
- `handlers.py` (new): REST routes for defs + runs (CRUD, status, mutations, outputs, resume tokens, per-run SSE stream endpoint).
- Register routes in `dashboard/server.py`; per-run `SseRegistry` on `DashboardState`.
- FE: `pages/workflows/` (new): `WorkflowsListPage.tsx` (defs + active runs), `WorkflowDefDetail.tsx` (view/edit def tree), `WorkflowRunDetail.tsx` (live run view, snapshot-then-subscribe).
- FE: `lib/api.ts` workflow methods + types; nav entry in Capabilities section (lazy import + `NAV` + `renderPage`).

### Slice 8: Live Chat Widget + Event Pipeline (est. 3 sessions)
- `WorkflowProgressCard.tsx` mirroring SdlcProgressCard (REST poll cadence from just-fetched status; detection regex over tool output).
- Event pipeline: dedup keys, deterministic event ids, event-fold law (pure fold, unit-locked like runFold.ts), epoch-tagged supersede-drop, node-keyed patches, per-observer debounced coalescing (~25ms) + schema-validated snapshot projection, result_omitted spill boundary (WF2-R11 + batch-5).
- FE lifecycle-union registration for ALL workflow SSE events (useRunStream.ts pattern; test asserting backend types ⊆ FE union).
- Typed ask-payload renderer (approval/choice/text/form) in the attention banner + needs-input inbox projection.
- Blocking-mode rendering; inline controls; two-step delete; per-item foreach progress rows; degraded/remediation rendering.

### Slice 9: Templates + Conventions Pack (est. 2 sessions)

- Conventions: triage-first + Finding record + baseline capture + `bundled/shared/` prompt blocks + template-lint + steering_examples (WF2-R15).
- `artifact_update` action provider (+ ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS).
- Bundled-sync logic (mtime, no-overwrite); structural contract tests per template; FE template picker; `workflow_plan` template referencing.

### Slice 10: Advanced Constructs + Context Lifecycle (est. 2 sessions)
- `foreach pipeline=true` (streaming handoff, no barrier); `loop until_dry`; `subworkflow` nesting (depth ≤ 3, namespaced instances, `child_run_attach`).
- Context lifecycle: `session: fresh` iteration resets + journaled handoffs, typed carryover buckets, decision records, output offloading to artifacts + `artifact_inspect`, two-layer compaction ladder (WF2-R6).
- Run-level token/time budget enforcement end-to-end; FE collapsible containers + iteration progress.

### Slice 11: Validation + Hardening (est. 2 sessions)
- End-to-end tests: full lifecycle (create → run → mid-flight edit → rewind → run_from → fork → complete).
- Adversarial property tests: concurrent mutations, crash-during-execution recovery (incl. mid-cancel restart), deep nesting, double-resume answer replay.
- **Timeout-fires regression pair** (WF2-R5 batch-5): stalled node killed within window; progressing node NOT killed.
- **Active-edge regression pair** (WF2-R18): untaken branch never deadlocks a join; async fan-out never fires a join prematurely.
- **Journal-replay regression harness** (WF2-R11): recorded JSONL traces (happy-path, restart-during-run, rewind-during-stream, network-degraded), duplicate/fanout/order/p95 metrics CI-gated against baseline.
- Performance: 50+ node specs schedule < 100ms; journal replay of 1000-entry runs; coalesced widget updates under 20-node fan-out.
- Security: binding sandbox (no eval, no fs access); RedactingSink coverage tests; run output redaction; write-scope escape attempts.
- Documentation: architecture doc, template authoring guide, manifest drift test.

## 9. Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Complexity of mid-flight editing while engine is running | Single-writer conductor with lock; mutations applied only between scheduling steps; frozen-region invariant + TOCTOU re-verify prevent invalid states |
| Journal/cache correctness across rewind | Epoch + inputs-hash keys + property tests for rewind idempotence; outputs AND journal regions archived not deleted; spec-region-hash stamps force re-frontier under mutated specs |
| Stale-binding inconsistency after rewind | Cascade computed over the binding-dependency graph (not the container tree) + `inputs_stale` flags + mandatory preview (WF2-R2) |
| Double-fired external effects on resume/rewind/fork | Effect ledger with idempotency keys; committed effects gate re-execution behind `redo_effects`; idempotent teardown contract (WF2-R1) |
| Join deadlock / premature join fire under conditional+async shapes | Active-edge gating with wait-entry activation + two CI-gated regression cases (WF2-R18) |
| Infinite fix loops / thrash in unattended runs | Deterministic LLM-free circuit breaker (`escalated` state) + budget soft caps + pre-charge + baseline_check (WF2-R4) |
| Agent self-certifying completion | Engine-owned transitions, verification ladder, required_artifacts, fresh-judge invariant (WF2-R3) |
| Stage subagent writes outside its scope (already happened once platform-wide) | Post-hoc fs diff vs `allowed_write_paths` → `scope_violation` + configurable block (WF2-R19) |
| Widget stale/duplicate/out-of-order updates (the K42/K44/K45 class) | Dedup keys, snapshot-then-subscribe, event-fold law, epoch-tagged supersede-drop, coalesced delivery, replay harness (WF2-R11) |
| New SSE events silently dropped by the FE | Mandatory lifecycle-union registration (useRunStream.ts pattern) + backend⊆FE-union test |
| Secrets leaking into durable stores (spec/journal/outputs/ledger) | credential_ref seam + `_has*` stripping + RedactingSink on the writers (WF2-R14) |
| Widget performance with large specs (50+ nodes) | Collapsible containers; node-keyed patches; per-observer debounced coalescing (one update per tick per connection); terminal nodes stop updating |
| Template expressiveness vs node-type proliferation | Orchestration patterns compose from core node types; only `infer` + `branch` added (each closing a real expressiveness gap); macros expand at def time |
| Config migration from old to new `workflows.*` namespace | Old keys simply removed; new keys have sensible defaults; no silent fallback to old semantics |
| SubagentManager concurrency cap hit by large parallel blocks | Per-lane caps respected by `tick()`; excess stays `ready`; heavy local-IO nodes can't starve LLM stages (WF2-R21) |
| Run-dir flood from high-frequency origins | Tiered retention: per-def cap, origin TTL, pinned exemption, crystallize-before-prune, terminal-run journal compaction |
| Scheduled def double-run / wedged lock after crash | DB-backed lease with expiry + explicit `on_overlap` policy (WF2-R1 batch-5) |
| Spawn-recursion depth abuse (workflow → stage → subagent → workflow) | `__wf_depth` counter (max 3, NEW enforcement — today's block is prompt-only); max-depth spawns get single subagent_run only |
| LLM-authored specs/mutations failing in LLM-specific ways | Strict compile + typed repromptable errors + mutation grammar rules + staged turns (WF2-R12, R20) |
| Timeouts that never actually fire (documented in the wild) | "Timeout fires" regression pair as Slice 11 acceptance criteria (WF2-R5 batch-5) |

## 10. Open Questions (for user decision)

1. **Legacy SOP migration:** Should old workflow SOPs be importable as single-stage workflows in the new system, or simply archived and left for manual reference?
2. **Approval trust levels:** ~~Should workflow runs inherit the session's approval mode?~~ PARTIALLY RESOLVED (WF2-R7): trigger-fired/scheduled runs get auto-approve where only destructive/high-risk gates block; remaining question — should *chat-origin* runs inherit the session's approval mode or carry a per-def trust policy?
3. **External event gates:** RESOLVED (WF2-R7e): supported with transient-hold semantics (prerequisite-absent does not consume the trigger event; bounded retry, loud give-up) — lands in Slice 5.
4. **Token budgets per run:** RESOLVED (WF2-R4): soft cap — breach pauses resumably with a ledger event + needs-input item; extend-budget gates at ~80%; budgets pre-charged from the journal on resume.

---

## Dependencies

- `SubagentManager` (existing): subagent spawning, concurrency, transcripts, orphan reconciliation — plus the NEW `__wf_depth` enforcement this plan adds (mirroring `__hook_depth`).
- `one_shot_completion` / reasoning axis (existing): the `infer` node's execution path.
- Per-run `SseRegistry` + WS `_broadcast` (existing loop pattern, dashboard/state.py): event delivery to FE. `state.notify` only for user-facing notifications.
- `SdlcProgressCard` + `useRunStream.ts` `RUN_LIFECYCLE` union + `runFold.ts` (existing): widget architecture + FE fold prior art.
- `loop/tick.py` (existing, pure `evaluate(cfg, state, now) -> Decision`) + `loop/store.py` (SQLite WAL): prior art for pure-function scheduling + run store.
- `loop/gates.py` `run_verify_command` + `loop/judge.py` independence pattern (existing): gate verification prior art.
- `action_providers` registry + `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (existing): action-node dispatch + the allowlist any new provider must join.
- `providers/registry.py` `workflow` `_TypeHandler` (existing): repointed at the v2 def-provider registry (PROVIDER_TYPES parity).
- `security.redact` / `fence_untrusted` / credential store (existing): secrets + untrusted-input seams.
- `fs_watch` (existing): def-file change detection.
- `snapshot.py` / `portability.py` (existing): gain the `workflows` backup component.

## Success Criteria

1. A user can author a multi-stage workflow (via chat or UI), start it, see live progress in a chat widget, edit unexecuted stages mid-flight with a cascade preview, rewind a completed stage, and see exactly its binding dependents re-execute — all within one chat session.
2. Background workflows run to completion without blocking chat; the widget updates live with no duplicate/out-of-order rendering under rewind (replay harness green).
3. Blocking workflows hold the chat turn until done, with progress visible.
4. At least 3 bundled templates work end-to-end (deep-research, code-implementation, audit-sweep), each opening with the triage-first convention and emitting canonical Finding records where applicable.
5. Resume after gateway restart works correctly: journal cache hit for completed nodes, re-execution for interrupted ones, budgets pre-charged (no fresh-budget minting), committed external effects NOT re-fired, sticky cancel intents honored.
6. Rewind/fork across a run containing committed side effects surfaces them in the preview and never double-fires without `redo_effects`.
7. The active-edge and timeout-fires regression pairs pass (joins never deadlock on untaken branches nor fire early on async fan-outs; stall timeouts kill stalled nodes and spare progressing ones).
8. A gate/judge never passes on the producing agent's self-report — engine-executed verification only; verdicts are closed-enum routed.
9. From `events.jsonl` alone, a run's reasoning path (prompt → tools → output per node, with model/cost) is reconstructable; crystallized digests survive retention pruning.
10. No residual code, config, or UI surface from the old SOP feature remains; the `workflow` provider type still round-trips app install/update (PROVIDER_TYPES ↔ handler parity test green).

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — sibling-platform gap analysis, owner greenlight)

**What & why.** Two sibling-platform mechanisms: (a) per-stage cached re-runs after an edit, and (b) a per-node inspection view. Recon verdict on (a): **already structurally covered** — the journal key is `sha256(instance_path + node_spec_hash + resolved_inputs_hash + epoch)` (§2 Resume) and §3 item 4 (inputs-hash memoization) already specifies that a cascaded node whose `(node_spec_hash, resolved_inputs_hash)` is unchanged replays its cached output after rewind/`run_from`/`update_node`. What is missing is *visibility and a locked acceptance bar*, so this amendment sharpens rather than duplicates: cache hits become a first-class ledger event and widget state, with a CI regression pair. (b) is genuinely additive UI: the ledger already journals the **fully-resolved post-binding prompt** (or content ref) per stage instance (§5 Run Ledger reconstructability criterion), but no surface exposes it — debugging "what exactly did this node see" requires reading `events.jsonl` by hand.

**Design (contract level).**
- New Run Ledger event: `step_cached` `{node_id, instance_path, journal_key, saved_tokens_est, cause: rewind|run_from|edit_cascade|resume}` — emitted whenever `frontier()` serves a completed node from the journal instead of dispatching. Widget: cached nodes render a distinct `cached` badge (not a fresh `done` pulse); `workflow_node_done` payload gains optional `cached: true`.
- Inspection endpoint: `GET /api/workflows/runs/{id}/nodes/{node_id}/inspect` → `{resolved_prompt | prompt_ref, resolved_inputs, output | artifact_ref, attempts: [attempt records], ledger_events: [...], cached: bool}` (secrets already never reach these stores per §1 Secrets Hygiene — the RedactingSink covers this surface for free). FE: an inspector drawer on `WorkflowRunDetail` node rows + a "inspect" affordance on the chat widget's node rows.
- Acceptance sharpening (Slice 11): edit node X mid-run → confirm cascade → every completed node OUTSIDE the binding closure re-completes via `step_cached` with zero model calls; a node INSIDE the closure re-executes. Asserted from the ledger, not logs.

**Lands in:** Slice 1 (`step_cached` emission — journal.py already computes the hit), Slice 7 (inspect endpoint + drawer), Slice 8 (widget badge), Slice 11 (regression pair). No new slice; honest estimate 31 → **32 sessions** (+1 spread across Slices 7/8).

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| WF2-A1 | `step_cached` ledger event + `cached` flag on `workflow_node_done`; cache-hit regression pair (outside-closure cached / inside-closure re-run, ledger-asserted) | `workflows/journal.py`, `workflows/tick.py`, Slice 11 test file | edit-then-rerun fixture shows N cached + M re-run nodes exactly matching the binding closure; zero model calls for cached nodes |
| WF2-A2 | Node inspection endpoint returning resolved prompt/inputs/output/attempts/ledger slice | `workflows/handlers.py`, `lib/api.ts` | endpoint returns the §5 reconstructability set for any terminal node; secrets absent (RedactingSink fixture) |
| WF2-A3 | FE inspector drawer (run detail + widget node rows) with cached badge rendering | `web/src/pages/workflows/WorkflowRunDetail.tsx`, `WorkflowProgressCard.tsx` | a user can open any node and read its exact resolved prompt, inputs, and output; cached nodes visually distinct |

## Execution log

- 2026-07-31 — **DONE (Phase 0: relocate shared code trapped in the old feature).**
  The three §7 Phase-0 items, plus the premise audit that has to precede a 32-session
  program. **No behavior change** — this is pure relocation, so Phase 1's deletion can
  be surgical instead of collateral.

  **Premise audit — all four §7 claims verified against code before touching anything:**
  (a) `mcp_prompts.py` and `agents/identity.py` did not exist; (b) `resolve_agent_id` had
  exactly ONE real consumer (`chat_runner.py:276`, through a thin `_resolve_agent_id`
  wrapper) plus its tests; (c) `_CURRENT_AGENT_ID` is owned by `mcp_core` and used by
  `mcp_workflows` only — so it stays in `mcp_core` for the new feature exactly as the plan
  says; (d) the `workflow` `_TypeHandler` really does register into
  `workflows/registry.py` (`providers/registry.py:224,229,628`), so the repoint-in-the-
  same-commit rule in §7 is real. The old package is 1758 lines across 9 modules with 23
  consumer files.

  **T0.1 — `prompt_render` → `mcp_prompts.py` (new tool category).** Saved Prompts are
  their own entity; the tool lived in `mcp_workflows` only because both were authored
  together, and Phase 1 deletes that module **wholesale**. Registered through BOTH sites
  the platform requires — `mcp_core._AGGREGATED_CATEGORY_MODULES` (the ACP MCP-server
  surface: an unlisted module is invisible to every ACP agent) and a
  `create_prompts_provider` factory reached via a new native app manifest
  (`apps/native/gideon-prompts/app.json`), mirroring `gideon-artifacts`.
  Removed from `mcp_workflows` in the same commit — no duplicate, no shim.

  **T0.2 — `resolve_agent_id` → `agents/identity.py`.** `chat_runner` was importing an
  identity rule across the workflow boundary. `composition.py` re-exports it so its own
  callers keep working (that file dies in Phase 1 anyway); `chat_runner` now imports the
  new home directly.

  **T0.3 — no action needed**, per the audit above: `_CURRENT_AGENT_ID` has no consumer
  outside `mcp_core`/`mcp_workflows`, so the plan's "if clean, keep it in mcp_core"
  branch applies.

  **DISCOVERY — a test file the §7 delete-list does not mention.**
  `tests/test_prompt_render_tool.py` asserted the tool's LOCATION (`mcp_workflows._post`
  patch targets), so it broke on the move and is repointed. Worth noting for Phase 1: §7's
  test-deletion list is 8 files, but `test_prompt_render_tool.py` must NOT be deleted with
  them — it now covers a surviving surface.

  **LANDMINE CONFIRMED — a new tool category has FOUR registration points, not one.**
  Two are code (aggregator tuple + provider factory/manifest) and two are guards that fail
  only after the fact: `tests/test_native_tool_categories.py` deliberately duplicates the
  aggregator list (`_CATEGORY_MODULES` + `_CATEGORY_PROVIDERS`) so a silent addition is
  impossible, and the offline reference needs
  `python -m gideon.manifest_reference` re-run (providers 28 → 29; tool count stays
  66 — it MOVED, it was not added). All four updated.

  **Three new boundary tests** pin the relocation so Phase 1 cannot quietly undo it:
  `prompt_render` is absent from the workflows category, `mcp_prompts` imports nothing
  workflow-related, and the aggregated ACP surface still exposes it.
  `tests/test_agent_identity.py` (6 cases) rescues the identity coverage from
  `test_workflows_composition.py`, which Phase 1 deletes — with two edge cases the
  original lacked (all-absent → `""` not `None`; whitespace stripping).

  **🔴 FINDING FOR PHASE 1 — the §7 delete-list has a gap that would break a SHIPPED
  feature.** `workflows/surfacing.py:113` consults `feedback.suppressed_producers()`, and
  `tests/test_feedback.py` asserts the `("workflow_surfacing", …)` producer pair round-trips
  (lines 141-173). Deleting `workflows/surfacing.py` per §7 therefore breaks
  Feedback-Signal S3's only *gated* consumer — its own execution log records that skills
  surfacing was deliberately NOT wired, so workflow surfacing is the sole live one.
  Phase 1 must either re-wire the suppression check into the v2 surfacing path or
  re-scope those feedback assertions deliberately. **Not a blocker for Phase 0; recorded
  before it becomes a surprise.**

  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (black/isort/flake8 + mypy, 565 files) · `make test`
  **9791 passed, 0 failed**. **Validated as a user** on an isolated dev home (:10777,
  never :10000): created a saved prompt with two `{{variables}}` through the real API,
  rendered it through the relocated tool end-to-end ("Report on the docs site for
  platform."), confirmed `gideon-prompts` and `gideon-workflows` both appear
  enabled in the Store, and confirmed each provider exposes exactly its own tools
  (1 and 5). **0 tracebacks.**

  **NOT in this session:** Phase 1 (delete the old feature) and Slice 0 (the new package).
  Phase 0 stands alone and is strictly better without them — the shared code is no longer
  hostage to a feature that is about to be deleted.
- 2026-07-31 — **DONE (Phase 1: delete the old feature entirely).** Owner-approved clean
  break ("Delete now, rebuild fast"), accepting the gap on `main` until the engine slices
  land. Everything §7 Phase 1 lists is gone; the namespace is reused, no compat shim.

  **Deleted:** the whole `workflows/` package (9 modules, 1758 lines), `mcp_workflows.py`,
  `run_workflow_provider.py`, 3 native app dirs (`native-workflows`,
  `gideon-workflows`, `run-workflow-action`), `web/src/pages/workflows/` (7 files),
  and the 8 test files §7 names. Surgical edits landed in `context.py` (the
  `[PREFERRED WORKFLOW]` surfacing block + force-include path), `server.py` (route
  registration + the session-expire SOP sweep), `loop_routes.py` (classifier catalog),
  `validation.py` (5 tool schemas, `_WORKFLOW_SCOPES`, the `run-workflow` hook entry),
  `mcp_core.py`, `fs_watch.py`, `action_providers/registry.py`, `config/loader.py`.

  **The `_TypeHandler` repoint — the constraint that shaped this commit.** §7's warning is
  real and verified: `providers/registry.py` registered app-contributed workflow providers
  into `workflows/registry.py`, and `PROVIDER_TYPES` must equal the runtime handler set or
  installing/reinstalling ANY app declaring a workflow provider is refused (#47's bug
  class, guarded by `test_manifest_types_match_handlers`). So `workflows/defs.py` — the v2
  def-provider registry + `WorkflowDefProvider` ABC — is landed EARLY, in the same commit
  as the deletion, and the handler now points at it. It is the seam only; read/list are
  required and write is optional (a bundled template pack is legitimately read-only), and
  a provider can never return a run — execution is engine-owned, since two writers on the
  journal would break terminal-write ownership.

  **User data preserved, not deleted.** `workflows/legacy.py` archives pre-v2
  `<name>/WORKFLOW.md` dirs to `workflows/_legacy_sops/` on startup. Idempotent by data
  inspection (no schema version exists; the house pattern), never raises (a permissions
  problem on one stale dir must not stop the gateway booting), collision-safe (a
  pre-existing archived name gets a `-2` suffix rather than being clobbered — it is the
  user's own writing), and it skips `_`-prefixed dirs so it cannot re-archive its own
  archive. 7 tests. **Verified on a real boot:** a planted SOP moved with content intact.

  **DEVIATION — the blast radius is materially wider than §7 documents.** Five surfaces
  had to be handled that its edit-list does not mention, each verified before touching:
  1. **`workflow_ids` is a PERSISTED SQLite column** on the loops table (`loop/store.py:159`)
     with 38 references across 21 files, including both LLM classifier prompts
     (`suggested_workflow_ids`) and the per-phase `execution_plan`. Removing it would be a
     class-B data change far beyond "surgical edits". **Kept intact**: the field persists,
     the loop capability contract still returns its `(skills, workflows)` pair, and
     `context.py` still accepts `force_workflow_ids` (documented as unused until Slice 6).
     The classifier catalog's workflow half simply returns empty — which, given the prompts
     say "use ONLY ids that appear in the catalog … empty when nothing fits", makes an
     empty list the correct model output rather than a prompt change to re-tune three
     slices later.
  2. **Five FE files** consumed the deleted `WorkflowItem` type and `api.workflows()`:
     `CapabilityPicker` (a shared primitive — its workflow peek branch removed, the `kind`
     discriminant deliberately kept so Slice 7 can re-add one without re-threading it),
     `ActionConfig` (the `workflow` widget, dead once no provider declares it),
     `AgentDetail` (the agent-scoped-SOP list — v2 defs are not agent-scoped, so nothing
     equivalent exists), and both plan reviews. A `WorkflowDefStub` type keeps the
     length-guarded pickers compiling against the persisted field.
  3. **`test_prompt_render_tool.py`** — as Phase 0 predicted, NOT deleted with the other 8;
     its Phase-0 boundary test flipped to asserting `mcp_workflows` is *gone*.
  4. **`TOOL_META`** had 5 stale entries; removing the block also removed `prompt_render`'s
     (it sat immediately after), caught by `test_api_manifest_drift` and restored under its
     own heading. Reference regenerated: 61 tools (was 66), providers 29 → 26.
  5. **Config:** `workflows.match_threshold` deleted (surfacing-only), `enabled` kept and
     re-documented as the engine kill-switch. The namespace is reused per §7.

  **🔴 CAPABILITY REGRESSION, recorded not hidden.** Phase 0 flagged that deleting
  `workflows/surfacing.py` breaks Feedback-Signal's suppression gate. Confirmed and
  resolved honestly: plan line 53 deliberately deletes embedding-based auto-surfacing (v2
  replaces it with an `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` block for RUNNING runs), so there is no
  eligibility gate to rewire — **and therefore no runtime consumer of
  `suppressed_producers()` remains**. The Settings panel still reads it for display and
  `check_retire_candidates` still proposes retirement, but nothing is actually withheld.
  `workflow_surfacing` STAYS in `PRODUCER_KINDS` (append-only Tier-S — records on disk
  reference it). `TestSurfacingSuppression` now pins the contract shape a consumer reads
  plus the vocabulary invariant, and names Slice 6 / the flywheel skill work as where an
  end-to-end case returns.

  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (black/isort/flake8 + mypy, 557 files — down from 565) ·
  `make test` **9698 passed, 0 failed** (down from 9791: 8 test files deleted with the
  feature) · web `typecheck` + **307 vitest** + `build` all green.

  **Validated as a user** on isolated dev homes (:10788, never :10000), driving the real
  UI in a browser: the dashboard renders with **no Workflows nav entry** and all 16 other
  sections intact; `#/workflows` no longer renders a broken page; Triggers, Loops, Apps,
  Prompts and Inbox all load; `/api/workflows*` returns 404 while status/apps/prompts/
  loops/triggers stay 200; the agent tool surface shows **zero `workflow_*` tools** with
  `prompt_render` present; the action-provider list is 9 with `run-workflow` absent and
  `run-prompt` present (so the UI cannot offer an action that would fail at dispatch); a
  planted legacy SOP was archived with content preserved. **0 console errors**; the 2
  gateway tracebacks are "no model provider configured" on a keyless seeded home.

  **NOT in this session:** Slice 0 (models/store/bindings/validator) onward. `defs.py`
  ships as the registry seam only — deliberately the minimum that keeps the provider-type
  parity guard honest.
- 2026-08-01 — **DONE (Slice 0: scaffold + data model + store + bindings + validator).**
  The four modules everything downstream types against, with the config section wired
  through all four points. No engine yet — nothing here executes.

  **`models.py` — the node algebra and the outcome model.** Dataclasses with explicit
  `to_dict`/`from_dict` rather than a validation library, because the tolerant-reader rule
  (WF2-R12) is the point: a spec written by a NEWER engine loads, unknown fields
  round-trip losslessly through `extra`, and an unknown enum value falls back instead of
  raising. The deliberate asymmetry: an unknown node **kind** DOES raise — the engine
  cannot schedule what it cannot dispatch. Verified both directions.
  - **Paths are the instance key**, not uuids: `root.children[1].cases[bug]`. That is what
    lets a later rewind invalidate exactly one journal region by prefix.
  - **Lanes derive from kind** (WF2-R21), never author-declared — a `config: {lane: llm}`
    on a transform is ignored, tested. A foreach over minutes-long local-model actions
    must not head-of-line-block a run's model calls.
  - **`DEGRADED` is in `SUCCESS_STATES`.** Degrade, don't die: an absent optional
    capability keeps a template working with visible provenance rather than failing it.
  - **Only `TRANSIENT`/`NETWORK` retry.** Retrying a USER or PERMISSION failure burns
    budget to reach the same failure. `cause_plain` and `remediation` are separate fields
    because the widget renders the remediation as the actionable step.

  **`bindings.py` — two resolution paths, one closed pipe set.** Whole-value refs preserve
  the source TYPE (a foreach needs a real list); embedded refs stringify, with containers
  through `json.dumps` because a Python repr's single quotes are not JSON and models
  reproduce them badly. The failure asymmetry is the load-bearing part: "the node produced
  null" flows through as a value, while "this reference does not resolve" raises a typed
  `BindingError` carrying the expression. A silent empty string there is how a prompt
  quietly loses its input and the run produces confident nonsense against no data.
  Pipe arguments are LITERALS ONLY — an identifier would turn the closed set into an
  expression language, and a spec is data the flywheel will later propose diffs to.

  **`store.py` — SQLite for queries, files for bulk.** Same idiom as `loop/store.py` (WAL,
  busy timeout, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` as the ladder). Rows hold only what queries
  need; spec/outputs/journal live in `runs/<id>/`. A journal reaches megabytes, so a row
  would make every status poll pay for it. `(root_run_id, status)` is indexed and a run
  defaults to being its own root, so a run TREE is one query and no run is invisible to it
  (WF2-R13). Corruption tolerance is a requirement, not defensiveness: a crash mid-append
  leaves a half-written final journal line, so `read_jsonl` skips it — refusing the file
  would turn one lost event into a lost run. Cancel is a FILE, so an intent issued while
  the gateway is down still applies on restart.

  **`validator.py` — accumulate, never throw.** Stable codes (`WF_MISSING_PROMPT`) an agent
  branches on, plus `summary()` as one repromptable message. Nine distinct defects in a
  deliberately-broken spec are all reported in a single pass — one-error-per-turn ping-pong
  is the failure mode being designed out. Also: Kahn levels for cycle detection (documented
  as DATA levels, explicitly NOT a schedule — container ordering is Slice 1's frontier),
  branch case-coverage against a declared enum, and **the untrusted-origin lint as an
  ERROR** (WF2-R9) — a `{{trigger.body}}` reaching a prompt without a sanitization pipe is
  rejected, because advisory-only would leave prompt-injection defence to author discipline.

  **DEVIATION — `WorkflowsConfig` reshaped, not just extended.** Phase 1 left it holding
  only `enabled`. It now carries `max_active_runs`, per-lane `max_concurrent_nodes`, the
  two-knob timeouts and `retention_per_def`, wired through the dataclass + `_meta`,
  `load()`, `to_dict()` and the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist with bounds. All six are
  runtime-editable on purpose: these are the knobs a user reaches for WHILE something is
  going wrong, and requiring a restart would mean restarting mid-run to fix a run. The
  plan's `model_tiers` slot map is deferred to Slice 1, where the tier→model resolution
  that consumes it lands — a config key with no reader is dead weight.

  **`__post_init__` CLAMPS rather than rejects.** A hand-edited `max_concurrent_nodes: 0`
  would deadlock every run; refusing to boot over it would be worse. Verified live: a
  config with `0` and `-5` boots to `1`.

  **LANDMINE — the provider-boundary residue rail fired, correctly.** The inline-credential
  lint's token prefixes (`sk-`/`ghp_`/`hf_`/`AKIA`) are vendor literals in core, so
  `test_provider_boundary_residue` flagged `validator.py`. That is the guard working: added
  to `docs/architecture/provider-boundary-keeps.txt` with a judgment, same class as
  `security.py`'s `xox[bpas]-` regexes — recognizing a key's SHAPE is secret DETECTION, not
  vendor logic, and narrowing the list would silently stop catching those providers' keys.

  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (black/isort/flake8 + mypy, 561 files) · `make test`
  **9808 passed, 0 failed**. 110 new tests across four suites (20 models / 31 bindings /
  30 store / 29 validator).

  **Validated as a user** on an isolated dev home (:10801, never :10000), two boots: all
  six config keys served by `GET /api/config/gideon` with correct defaults; a PATCH
  of `workflows.max_concurrent_nodes` persisted (6 → 12); an out-of-range 9999 was REJECTED
  with "must be between 1 and 64"; the kill-switch toggled; and a hand-edited nonsensical
  config clamped to sane values on boot. **0 tracebacks.**

  **NOT in this slice:** the frontier and engine (Slice 1). `defs.py` remains the registry
  seam from Phase 1 — def CRUD, fs-watch and bundled sync land with the engine that reads
  them, since a loader with no executor cannot be validated end to end.

- **DONE — Slice 1: Pure Frontier Core + Engine** (2026-08-01)

  `tick.py` (pure frontier + lanes + loop-exit), `engine.py` (node dispatchers),
  `controller.py` (single-writer tick loop), `journal.py` (resume cache + Run Ledger),
  `watchdog.py` (crash recovery + retention). Config: per-lane caps + the `model_tiers`
  slot map through all four points. Wired into `gateway.py` (`WorkflowWatchdog` start/stop)
  and `dashboard/state.py` (`workflow_sse` registry, key `workflow:<run_id>`).

  **DEVIATION — active edges are recorded as DECLINED, not ACTIVE (WF2-R18).** The plan
  says the frontier consults an active-edge set. Implementing it that way produced a real
  deadlock, found by running the plan's own regression case: a `branch` records routing
  among its CASES, but a sibling's `needs: [router]` is a plain ordering edge onto the
  branch as a whole. Inferring "not active ⇒ blocked" starved that sibling forever. The
  mechanism is inverted to record only edges explicitly DECLINED, and unreachable paths are
  made TERMINAL by marking them SKIPPED — a `needs` edge is then satisfied by any terminal
  predecessor. Same guarantee in both directions, no starvation. `NodeInstance.active_edges`
  → `declined_edges`.

  **A `branch` is a real node, not pure structure.** It evaluates its selector, records the
  routing decision, and produces `{"case": label}` for downstream bindings — so it is
  dispatched, and its own state gates its cases.

  **Container state is DERIVED, never stored.** Testing a container's stored state in the
  frontier skipped past a branch's selected case. Every container consults `_derive`, so a
  rewind that resets children cannot leave a stale container verdict behind.

  **TWO BUGS FOUND BY DRIVING A REAL RUN, both invisible to the unit tests:**
  (1) a `wait` deadline lived only in controller memory, so a restart left every waiting run
  parked forever reporting `needs_input` — `NodeInstance.wake_at` is now persisted;
  (2) a woken `wait` wrote its output to memory only, so after a restart a binding on it
  resolved to `None` — it now goes through `store_output`. Both have regression tests.

  **A mutation sweep found a real test gap.** Deleting `redact()` from the journal WRITE
  path left all 160 tests green — node-output redaction is separately applied and masked it.
  Two tests added (every persisted record + the returned record); the mutation is now caught.

  **mypy caught a wiring bug before it ever ran:** the gateway attribute is `subagent_mgr`,
  not `subagents`, which would have failed every `stage` node at runtime.

  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (black/isort/flake8 + mypy, 566 files) · `make test`
  **9973 passed, 0 failed** (was 9808). 165 new tests across four suites (42 tick /
  45 engine / 51 controller / 27 watchdog); 85–94% coverage on the new modules.
  Mutation-verified: 7 targeted mutations, all caught.

  **Validated as a user against a REAL provider** (Bedrock, `global.anthropic.claude-opus-5`,
  isolated dev home on :10805 — never :10000):
  · a 3-node triage workflow classified a real bug report, routed on the classification,
    skipped both untaken paths, and produced a correct root-cause diagnosis (9.8s);
  · a 3-way judge panel with `join: quorum` ran concurrently (4.5s), then resumed in 0.0s
    with **5 `step_cached` events and zero model calls**;
  · a `foreach` fan-out returned schema-conformant JSON per item (fenced output stripped);
  · an unresolvable binding failed as USER class with actionable remediation, not a traceback;
  · lane caps are real, not decorative: the same spec took 5.5s at `llm=1` vs 2.7s at
    `llm=3` — a measured **2.0x** speedup;
  · crash recovery: killed mid-run, the watchdog adopted the run, step A was NOT re-run, and
    its output survived into step B;
  · a fresh gateway boot logs `workflow watchdog started` with **0 tracebacks**.

  **ARCC was not queried (MCP server unavailable in this session).** Standard practice
  applied to the security-relevant surfaces: every journal write passes through `redact()`
  before touching disk (verified live — a `sk-…` in model output never lands); the retention
  sweep refuses any path escaping the runs root (a stored `run_id` is not a trust boundary);
  `{{secret:KEY}}` resolves through an injected resolver so unit tests never touch real
  credentials; and `MAX_WF_DEPTH` is the first CODE check on spawn recursion — the previous
  contract was a sentence in a system prompt.

  **NOT in this slice:** `defs.py` def CRUD / fs-watch / bundled sync (no authoring surface
  consumes them until Slice 6/7); `subworkflow` execution (Slice 10 — it returns a typed
  refusal rather than a silent skip); the effect ledger (Slice 3); mid-flight mutation
  (Slice 4). Retry currently re-runs a fresh attempt; mutation-hint injection is Slice 2.

### S147 — the per-node stall window was declared by four templates and read by nothing (WF2-R5)

**DONE.** Found by a mechanical sweep rather than by reading: every config key the bundled library
declares (35 distinct) checked against every string literal in `src/gideon`. Two keys had no
reader anywhere — `allow_failure` and `timeout_stall_secs` — and this session took the dangerous one.

**Four shipped templates set a per-node stall window and every one was ignored:**

| template | node | asks | actually got |
|---|---|---|---|
| `design-project` | `refine` | 600s | 300s |
| `general-project` | `project` | 900s | 300s |
| `goal-pursuit-open-ended` | `work` | 900s | 300s |
| `goal-pursuit-verifiable` | `work` | 1200s | 300s |

`_enforce_stall_timeouts` read `self.services.node_timeout_stall` and never looked at the node's own
config, so the run-level default applied to everything.

**This fails in the wrong direction, which is why it is worth a session.** `timeout_stall` exists to
catch a node that has gone *silent*, not one that is merely *slow* — that distinction is the entire
reason `engine._wait_with_progress` feeds a heartbeat while a nested run works. A `work` node whose
author measured it needing twenty minutes was being cancelled at five, as a TIMEOUT, with a
remediation pointing at a config key that would not have helped. The knob existed precisely to
prevent that and had never applied.

**A node may RAISE its window, never lower it.** The run-level value is the operator's floor for how
long a silent node may sit; letting a bundled spec shorten it would let a template tighten an
operator's policy from inside the library. So the effective window is `max(run_default, declared)`.

**Zero/invalid falls back to the default rather than disabling the check.** A malformed knob must not
switch a safety timeout off — the failure mode a `timeout_stall_secs: 0` would otherwise buy is an
un-killable wedged node, which is strictly worse than a short window. An unknown node path falls back
too, rather than raising inside the sweep.

**A process note on measurement.** My first probe of `_node_stall_window` reported two failures. The
implementation was correct; the probe passed a node **id** where the controller keys on a structural
path (`root.children[0]`). Re-reading what `_walk` actually yields fixed the probe, not the code —
worth recording because a wrong probe that "finds a bug" is how a correct implementation gets
rewritten.

The test reads the four real declarations out of the bundled library rather than restating them, so it
keeps tracking the templates it is meant to protect; a hand-copied list would silently stop covering
a template that changed its number.

Verified load-bearing: reverting the per-node lookup turns 2 of the 9 new tests red. Gate: `make lint`
(black+isort+flake8+mypy, 691 files) green; `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` **16114 passed, 29 skipped,
13 xfailed**. No `web/` change.

- **REMAINING from this sweep:** `allow_failure` is declared by `rich-ingest` and read by nothing —
  the other unread key. It needs a decision about what tolerating a node failure MEANS for the
  frontier (skip the dependents, or run them with a null input?), which is a contract question rather
  than a wiring one, so it is recorded here rather than guessed at.

### S148 — `allow_failure` honoured: a tolerated lens degrades, it does not fail the run (WF2-R18)

**DONE.** The second finding of S147's config sweep, and it closes that sweep. `rich-ingest` declares
`allow_failure: true` on **all five** of its extraction lenses, which run in a `parallel` with
`join: all`. Measured:

```
container_outcome([DONE, DONE, DONE, DONE, FAILED], join=ALL)  ->  FAILED
```

So one flaky lens **discarded the four that had succeeded** — the exact outcome the key exists to
prevent, on the template that declares it five times over. Confirmed unread in **both** positions: the
node config where the template puts it, and the `with` block LOOPS-EVOLUTION's log names as "the real
form" (that block is the action-provider args, so it would not have applied to an `infer`/`stage` lens
anyway).

**DEGRADED, not DONE — the whole design decision.** `SUCCESS_STATES` already includes DEGRADED, so the
join proceeds and the run continues. Masking to DONE would make a partial extraction
indistinguishable from a complete one: the run would report success and nothing would ever say a lens
was missing, which is the silent-drop shape this program keeps finding. `container_outcome`'s existing
ALL branch already propagates "any DEGRADED child ⇒ DEGRADED container", so the honest verdict
travels upward for free.

**Only FAILED is masked.** A CANCELLED child is a decision someone made and a BLOCKED one is waiting
on a human; tolerating either would convert a deliberate stop into a shrug. Asserted per state.

**Tolerance is PER CHILD, not per container** — a tolerated lens failing must not excuse an intolerant
sibling failing, or `allow_failure` on one node would silently weaken every node beside it.

**The template turned out to be coherent end to end**, which is worth recording because it is what
made DEGRADED the right answer rather than a compromise: every downstream consumer already reads
`{{nodes.lens-X.output.items | default([])}}`, so a tolerated lens yields an empty list and
`store-decisions`/`store-facts`/… proceed with what did extract. The test asserts that too — without
the `| default([])`, tolerance would just move the failure one node later, and a future template
edit that dropped it would silently reintroduce the bug.

Verified load-bearing: removing the mask turns 2 of the 9 new tests red. Gate: `make lint`
(black+isort+flake8+mypy, 691 files) green; `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` **16123 passed, 29 skipped,
13 xfailed**. No `web/` change.

**The config sweep is now closed** — both unread keys it found (`timeout_stall_secs` in S147,
`allow_failure` here) are wired, and re-running the sweep reports no bundled config key without a
reader.
- [2026-08-11][WV-12] DONE — the two-layer compaction ladder for LLM-backed nodes. A long-horizon node previously died on a context-length rejection the engine could have avoided: it sent the prompt as-is and let the provider decide.
  **DEVIATION — the EXT dep was STALE, and that was the whole finding.** The dep line reads `EXT:CONTEXT-ECONOMY:cheap-summarizer/compaction seam (queue records it does not exist yet)`. It exists: `context_compaction.compact()` (:193) with a documented no-LLM deterministic fallback, tool-pair integrity, anchoring and a prefix guard. It had exactly ONE caller — `agents/native/runtime.py:1306`, the native agent loop — and the workflow engine never used it. So the seam was built and the engine was the gap, not the reverse. Recorded here so the queue note stops misleading the next reader.
  **Both layers, and where they hook.** New `workflows/compaction.py`; `complete_with_compaction()` wraps both LLM-backed dispatchers in `engine.py` — `dispatch_infer` and the judge sample loop in `dispatch_gate`. `controller.py` owns the per-node save history and passes it in. Layer 1 fires proactively at ~80% of the bound model window; layer 2 re-compacts aggressively and retries ONCE on a length rejection before the node fails.
  **The chars-vs-tokens caveat is documented at the constant, not hidden.** The threshold is `model_context_window(bound_model) × 4 chars/token × 0.80`, measured with `total_chars`. Four chars/token UNDER-estimates on the dense content workflow prompts actually carry (code, JSON, paths run nearer 3), so layer 1 fires later than ideal — which is precisely what layer 2 backstops. No tokenizer on the hot path to refine a threshold whose job is to be approximately early. A pinned model wins over the axis head, because a cross-family judge can have a different window.
  **"Summarizer fails" means a supplied `summarize_fn` RAISED.** `summarize_fn=None` is a working configuration (`compact` digests deterministically), so it is not the failure case. A raise drops the middle and leaves a placeholder that NAMES the loss, and three tests hold that: it survives, it names the loss, and it does not masquerade as the deterministic digest — a silent fallback would read downstream as a complete summary.
  **Reuse, not reimplementation.** All slicing, fencing and tool-pairing stay in `context_compaction.compact`; the node prompt is segmented on paragraph boundaries so head+tail protection keeps the frame and the instruction. `should_compact` is wired rather than reinvented, keyed by **node id, not instance path** — keyed by path, a loop's iterations would each start from an empty save history and the anti-thrashing rule could never fire.
  **End to end, as the done-when requires.** The bundled `audit-sweep` (`until_dry` loop) driven with a REAL controller, journal and state on disk and only the model call stubbed: 12 of 15 prompts compacted, all under budget, all nodes completed — and the outcome asserted IDENTICAL to the same template driven uncompacted, rather than against a hardcoded status. Layer 2 exercised mid-loop.
  **DISCOVERY — a test escaping its home, found via a 120s timeout.** The first e2e draft patched only `workflows.store.config_dir`. That is not isolation: `tasks/native.py:46 _tasks_dir()` binds `config_dir` itself, so one run read the developer's REAL task store (43,277 files) through `_task_map()`, which stamps a derived comment count per task — roughly 259,000 file opens, 35s, tripping the timeout. Setting `GIDEON_HOME` took it to 1.09s. The 35s was confirmed identical with and without this atom's change before concluding. The fixture docstring records it. Also worth flagging as a latent O(n²) in task creation that any test touching the real home will hit.
  **VERIFY-PASS correction (mine, not the implementer's).** The implementation report said "241 passed / 1 failed — that one was real, not load" without naming the test, so I refused to ship on it and challenged for a nodeid. It was `test_workflows_hardening.py::TestDocumentationAccuracy::test_the_doc_covers_every_module_that_EXISTS`, asserting `modules with no doc entry: ['compaction.py']` — a set-difference over `root.glob("*.py")` versus the module table in `docs/architecture/workflows.md`. Correctly classified as real: no event loop, no `Runner is closed`, deterministic, and it named the atom's OWN new file rather than a random victim — the opposite signature from the contention cluster. It was already fixed in the commit (the single doc-table row), but the fix and the failure were reported in different places and never connected, so the count read as an open failure. I verified the named test green, confirmed the row is in the COMMIT rather than only the worktree, and ran the full file (31 passed) — the clean whole-batch re-run the report never supplied.
  **Contention triage, per file rather than by assertion.** A broad `-k` run gave 72 failed / 4275 passed. Serially on a verified-clear field the four-file async cluster went 136 passed / 0 failed (46 failures under load); `fork.py` 43/43 (22 under load) and `mutation_queue` 25/25 (8 under load) were confirmed individually. This atom edits `controller.py` and `engine.py` — the very files those suites drive — so "known flake" was the one verdict not acceptable on a summary line; only the per-file serial result separates contention from a hook regression.
  **Gate (independent, judged by EXIT CODE):** black/isort/flake8 all 0; `mypy src/gideon harness` clean on 789 files (mypy caught a real error during implementation — `**pin` splatted into typed kwargs, now named); the new 38-test suite plus `inert_surface_baseline`, `agent_reference` and `docs_lint_baseline` — 67 passed, no baseline regeneration needed. PYTHONPATH proved via `compaction.__file__` resolving under the worktree.
- [2026-08-11][WV-13] DONE — `on_item_error: collect` finally has an executor, and `ItemErrorPolicy` has a ratchet that refuses to let the next member ship without one.
  **The finding: a declared strategy with no executor, and — unusually — an ADVERTISED one.** `models.py` declared `HALT | SKIP | COLLECT`; `validator.py:239` accepted `collect` (`ItemErrorPolicy(raw)`); `service.capabilities` published `item_error_policies=[p.value for p in ItemErrorPolicy]`, which is the catalog an authoring model reads before it writes a spec. Meanwhile `tick.py` compared against `HALT` (stop starting items once one failed) and `SKIP` (tolerate → DEGRADED once every item is terminal) and **nothing anywhere read `COLLECT`**. `_derive` fell through to `container_outcome(item_states)`, so a `collect` fan-out silently got a MIXTURE: it did not halt early (like SKIP) but any failure failed the container (like HALT) — neither documented behaviour. `inert-surface-baseline.json` had independently listed `enum:ItemErrorPolicy.COLLECT` as inert for the length of the program.
  **HONEST NOTE on the coincidence.** The chosen semantics — run everything, then fail — are the same OUTCOME the accidental fallthrough already produced. So this atom does not change what a `collect` fan-out's verdict is; it changes that the verdict is DECLARED, adds the failures-as-data half that was entirely missing, and makes the next member's silence impossible. Verified before implementing: no `COLLECT` branch existed anywhere (`grep -rn "ItemErrorPolicy\." src/gideon` showed only the two comparisons plus the `SKIP` default), so the premise held; the fallthrough was luck, not intent, and luck is not a contract.
  **Semantics, one line each.** HALT — stop starting new items on the first failure; the un-started items stay PENDING, the container never goes terminal, and the run ends through the frontier's deadlock path (FAILED) having done the least work it could. SKIP (default) — every item runs, a failure is tolerated, container DEGRADED, which is a SUCCESS state, so the run COMPLETES. COLLECT — every item runs (never halts early, exactly like SKIP), and then the failures COUNT: the container reports the worst item verdict, so the run FAILS, and the per-item failures are journaled.
  **FAILED, not DEGRADED, and the reason is `_ROOT_TO_RUN`.** It maps `DEGRADED → RunStatus.COMPLETE` and `FAILED → RunStatus.FAILED`. A DEGRADED terminal for COLLECT would make its run-level observable IDENTICAL to SKIP's, so the one policy whose entire point is that the failures matter would report success — the silent-drop shape this program keeps finding. The branch returns `container_outcome(item_states)` rather than a hard-coded `FAILED` so an item that was CANCELLED or BLOCKED still reports the more severe verdict off `_worst`'s severity order; flattening "someone cancelled item 2" into "the fan-out failed" throws away the more informative half.
  **Errors-as-data: the journal, because no container output surface EXISTS.** Checked before choosing: `controller._outputs` is keyed by node id and written only where a LEAF completes (a dispatch result, a resolved `wait`, an answered gate); the frontier only ever yields leaves; and a container deliberately has NO stored instance — `container_outcome`'s own docstring is "Never stored — always computed, so a rewind that resets children cannot leave a stale container verdict behind". Publishing the collected set under the foreach's node id would make `{{nodes.<fan>.output}}` resolve in memory and then resolve to NOTHING after a restart, because rehydration reads `inst.output_ref` and there is no container instance to read — a live reader of an unwritten key, which is the worst of the shapes this program hunts. So the failures go where the run already keeps per-node truth: one `items_collected` ledger record per fan-out per epoch (`item_index`, `item_label`, `instance_path`, `node_id`, `failure_class`, `cause` per failed instance), written from `_frontier` in the same shape as `_journal_wip_holds`, deduped by `path@epoch` and SEEDED FROM THE LEDGER — unlike `_wip_logged`'s in-memory-only set, because this payload carries a COUNT and a resumed run that wrote it twice would tell a reader the fan-out failed twice.
  **Follow-up, written down rather than half-built.** A downstream node is already REACHABLE: `tick.py:403` continues a sequence past a terminal FAILED child unless the child declares `on_error: fail_run`, so the node after a collect fan-out runs. The only missing piece is a way to BIND the collected set into it — either (1) a durable container-output surface: a container instance (or an equivalent persisted container-outputs map) written at the derivation moment and restored on rehydrate, so `{{nodes.<fan>.output.failures}}` survives a restart, or (2) a read-only ledger action provider, which is cheaper and reuses an existing shape. Either is its own atom with its own rewind semantics; inventing one inside this atom is exactly the new-mechanism-under-cover-of-a-fix move.
  **The ratchet, and proof it can fail.** The decision moved into one named function, `tick.foreach_outcome(policy, item_states)`, exhaustive over the enum with a RAISING tail instead of a default. Three tests hold it: every member driven through it (parametrized over `list(ItemErrorPolicy)`), the raise asserted for an unmapped value, and an AST read of `foreach_outcome` asserting it names every member by attribute — a behavioural test alone would happily pass a fallthrough shared by two members, which is precisely how COLLECT hid. Proven to fail: temporarily adding a fourth member `RETRY_ALL` reds `test_every_member_has_a_branch[retry_all]` and `test_the_source_branches_on_every_member_by_name` (2 failed, 8 passed).
  **The three-way behavioural test.** One seeded failing item in a 3-item fan-out, driven through the real controller/tick/journal path on disk: item 1 of 3 cannot satisfy the body's `{{item.v}}` binding, which is a USER-class `BindingError` — deterministic, zero tokens, and NOT retryable, so no flake surface. `max_concurrency: 1` is load-bearing: unbounded, every item is launched before the first failure exists to halt on, and HALT would look identical to SKIP. Results are three DIFFERENT observables — `halt`: FAILED, items {0,1} started; `skip`: COMPLETE, items {0,1,2}; `collect`: FAILED, items {0,1,2} — plus a distinctness assertion stated directly, so a later change that collapses two policies fails there rather than looking like a passing suite. 18 tests in `tests/test_workflows_item_error_policy.py`.
  **Baseline.** `inert-surface-baseline.json` regenerated with `scripts/generate_inert_surface_baseline.py`, never hand-edited: 152 → 151 total, `enum` 25 → 24, the single removed line being `enum:ItemErrorPolicy.COLLECT`. No other baseline moved — no new module, so `docs/architecture/workflows.md`'s module table is unchanged.
  **DEVIATION — none on scope.** One process note: a `git checkout -- src/gideon/workflows/models.py` used to undo the temporary fourth member reverted the whole file including this atom's own docstring work, which had to be re-applied. Reaching for `git checkout --` to undo a two-line probe is the destructive-git shape; a targeted edit back would have cost nothing.
