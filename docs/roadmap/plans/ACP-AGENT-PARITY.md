# ACP-AGENT-PARITY

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/AAP.md`](../atomic/AAP.md) as 10 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: ACP Agent Parity — One Provider, the Whole Platform

**Status:** PROPOSED — created 2026-07-14 from the ACP agent-parity audit (`docs/roadmap/research/acp-agent-parity-audit.md`)
**Created:** 2026-07-14
**Wave:** 0-eligible — no hard dependencies; standalone architectural cleanup of an existing seam. Phase 1 can start today (all three binaries are on the dev machine).
**Depends on:** nothing hard. Touches the same approval-gate seams AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS hardens (coordinate, don't block: this plan extends host gates *across the provider seam*; guardrails deepens them for everyone). EXECUTION-ISOLATION's sandbox wrap already applies to ACP processes (`transport.py:316`) — no interaction.
**Scope:** a user who binds ONE ACP provider (claude-code, codex, or kiro-cli) should be able to use the ENTIRE platform end to end — chat, tools, approvals, loops, cron, learning, resume — without discovering that half the harness silently only works for the native runtime. The audit's verdict: the seam is cleaner than feared (`chat_runner._run_chat` is provider-neutral; context injection, approvals-when-requested, variants/fork/queue, preference learning all already cross it), but 10 concentrated gaps remain. This plan validates the code-audit predictions at runtime (Phase 1), then closes the closable gaps and *honestly documents* the protocol-limited ones (Phase 2). **No dual paths:** where the ACP protocol genuinely can't carry something, we document the boundary as a known constraint — we do not build a shadow mechanism that pretends it does.

---

## Overview

The native execution loop (`agents/native/runtime.py`) has deep harness integration: the in-process tool registry, pre-execution deny-list/task-mode/PreToolUse gating, failure breakers, unattended stripping, dry-run, procedural-memory capture, typed tool-result meta, mid-turn steering. ACP-provided agents (claude-code, codex, kiro-cli) were suspected to be second-class citizens. The 2026-07-14 code audit (95 evidence citations) found the architecture better than feared — most integration lives *above* the seam in provider-neutral `chat_runner` code — but confirmed 10 real gaps, clustered in four places:

1. **Tool surface:** the native registry (knowledge/tasks/loops/inbox/artifacts/workflows/subagents/web) reaches an ACP CLI only via the `gideon-core` MCP server, and only if the CLI's *own* config spawns it. The host sends `"mcpServers": []` at `session/new` on every live path (`acp/client.py:419, 481`). claude/codex get no seeded config at all; kiro's discovery of `~/.gideon/agents/gideon.json` is unverified.
2. **Per-tool machinery** inside `NativeAgentRuntime` (breaker, loop detection, dry-run, unattended, steering) never runs for ACP turns.
3. **Learning capture:** the procedural-outcome drain is native-only.
4. **Per-dialect protocol asymmetries** (plan mode, effort, personas, concurrent sessions, resume).

The cleanup principle: **the host seam owns everything it can carry; the agent app bundle owns per-CLI config; upstream protocol limits get documented, not worked around.**

Verified starting points (paths under `src/gideon/` unless noted):

- `acp/client.py:419, 481` — both `session/new` call sites hardcode `"mcpServers": []`. The plumbing for the fix half-exists: the P9 pool path already accepts an `mcp_servers` param (`llm/acp_session_provider.py:240-247`) that no live caller passes.
- `gideon mcp-core` is an existing single stdio endpoint aggregating artifacts/workflows/memory/subagents + core tools (`mcp_core.py:918-952`), already referenced by the kiro-targeted agent config generator (`agent.py:253`).
- `acp/translate.py:104-141` already parses structured `rawInput` from tool_call frames (including strReplace old/new/path) — the raw material for closing most of the tool-card fidelity gap host-side, without touching the CLIs.
- `chat_runner.py:1771-1795` — the host approval gate (deny-list, task-mode, blocking PreToolUse) applies to ACP tools **only when the CLI emits `session/request_permission`**; CLI-auto-approved tools bypass it entirely, with hooks explicitly informational after the fact (`chat_runner.py:1623-1632`).
- `provider_bridge.py:528-537` — the bridge *pops* `unattended`/`dry_run`/`extra_tool_roots`/`project_id` before non-native builders ever see them.
- `acp_bundles/_register.py:38` `register_acp_cli_entry` — no bundle passes `session_files_dir`, so the `session/load` resume path is dead by construction (`client.py:388-414`).

**Soul guardrail:** this is parity for ONE user's machine — config seeding, gate-coverage plumbing, and honest documentation. No protocol forks, no patched CLIs, no reimplementation of CLI-internal behavior on the host.

---

## Phase 1 — VALIDATION (as-a-user sweeps, one provider at a time)

Per the user's explicit directive, validation comes FIRST: the audit is a code-level read; every UNKNOWN cell and every WIRED/PARTIAL/ABSENT verdict gets confirmed at runtime before a line of fix code is written. Fixes sequenced on *observed* severity, not predicted.

**Method:** the campaign validation doctrine — real UI via Chrome DevTools MCP, every cycle **mutates state → inspects persistence → verifies consumers** (no shallow render-checks). One provider per session, in order **claude-code → codex → kiro-cli**, each driving the whole platform end to end. Each provider session executes the audit's §6 twelve-step checklist verbatim, with a native control run of the same step where the checklist calls for one:

1. MCP tool reachability (gap 1) — "list your tools; do you have knowledge_search / task_create / notify?", then exercise one for real. For kiro: verify whether `~/.gideon/agents/gideon.json` is honored.
2. Approval-gate coverage (gap 2) — file read / file write / destructive bash; note which surface a host card vs run silently; repeat the write under task-mode=Ask.
3. Plan mode (gap 9) — claude/codex should plan natively (forwarded `acp_mode=plan`); kiro blocked only by the host gate.
4. Unattended loop (gap 3) — small Code loop bound to the provider, unattended; watch for wedging (esp. kiro) and whether writes execute (claude/codex `bypassPermissions`).
5. Resume (gap 6) — restart the gateway mid-conversation; expect fall-to-compressed-history, verify continuity quality.
6. Tool-card fidelity (gap 7) — multi-tool turn; input args, output, done-state, diff chips, recovery hints.
7. Context/turn telemetry — context-% chip, turn-complete line, `/compact` behavior.
8. Reasoning effort + model override — composer effort pill (kiro expected absent/no-op) + discovered-model pick.
9. Learning — correction → "Learned:" chip (should fire, neutral); confirm no procedural outcomes recorded (expected gap 4).
10. Steering + queued messages — mid-turn send should queue (not steer) on ACP; queue drains after the turn.
11. Subagents (if MCP reachable) — spawn one; verify completion injects back into the right session.
12. Concurrent sessions (kiro only) — `acp_concurrent_sessions` on, two kiro chats, one PID serving both.

**Preconditions (from the audit's binary snapshot, 2026-07-14):** all three binaries present. `claude` + `codex` + `codex-acp` installed with auth artifacts; `claude-agent-acp` adapter will provision via npx/durable-install on first enable (Node 24 present). **kiro-cli is Amazon-internal auth — check `mwinit` freshness FIRST in the kiro session**; a stale midway token would masquerade as protocol failures.

**Deliverable per provider (checked in beside the audit):**
- A **verified matrix column** — every audit cell for that provider re-marked with the runtime result: CONFIRMED (matches the code-audit prediction) or DIVERGED (with what actually happened). UNKNOWN cells (registry reachability, AskUserQuestion, codex/kiro compaction + slash commands, context-% emission, subagent inject-back) become definite.
- A **gap inventory with severity** (P0 safety / P1 capability-dead / P2 fidelity / P3 cosmetic), feeding the Phase 2 sequencing. Anything the audit missed gets added to the inventory, not silently fixed.

Incidental small bugs found en route get fixed in-session per campaign doctrine; anything structural waits for Phase 2 so fixes land against the full three-provider picture.

**Effort: ~3 sessions (1 per provider).**

---

## Phase 2 — PARITY FIXES (sequenced by gap severity)

Each fix names its **owner**: *core seam* (host-side `src/gideon/`), *agent app bundle* (`apps/claude-code-agent` / `codex-agent` / `kiro-cli-agent` + `acp_bundles/_register.py`), or *upstream CLI limitation* (documented as a known constraint — see §2.7). Ordering follows the audit's gap ranking, adjusted by Phase 1 findings if they diverge.

### 2.1 MCP reachability — gap 1 (the biggest single unlock)

Without this, an ACP session has none of knowledge/tasks/inbox/artifacts/workflows/subagents/notify — the single largest capability cliff.

- **Owner: core seam + agent app bundles, two-pronged.**
- **Prong A (protocol-first, core seam):** pass the `gideon-core` server spec (`gideon mcp-core` stdio command, resolved via the same `_resolve_gideon_bin` used by `agent.py:253`) in `mcpServers` at `session/new` — the ACP protocol field exists and the pool path already has the parameter (`acp_session_provider.py:240-247`); wire it through both `client.py` call sites (419, 481 — including `start_fresh_turn_session`) and the live `session.py` caller. Phase 1 tells us which CLIs actually honor protocol-passed `mcpServers`; where honored, this is the clean fix — zero user-config mutation, per-session `GIDEON_SESSION_KEY` env already flows via `transport.py:323-326`.
- **Prong B (config seeding, agent app bundle):** for any CLI that ignores protocol `mcpServers`, the bundle's `create_provider`/enable path seeds the CLI's own config: claude-code → `mcpServers` block in the (already opt-in isolatable) `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` settings; codex → `~/.codex/config.toml` `mcp_servers` entry; kiro → ensure `gideon.json` is discoverable from `~/.kiro/agents/` (symlink or copy of `~/.gideon/agents/gideon.json`, which already lists `@gideon-core`). Seeding is marker-scoped and idempotent (the prompt-seed contract: never clobber user config outside our block; remove on disable exactly what we wrote). The claude-code isolated-config hardening (`GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE`) becomes the *preferred* documented setup because seeding an isolated dir touches nothing of the user's.
- **Acceptance:** per provider, "list your tools" shows gideon-core tools; `knowledge_search`, `task_create`, `notify`, and `subagent_run` (with correct session inject-back via the `session_pid_<pid>.txt` + env resolution) all work as-a-user. The dashboard MCP manager's external servers (`~/.gideon/mcp.json` → rebuilt into `gideon.json`) reach kiro; claude/codex external-MCP parity rides the same prong that wins for core.

### 2.2 Approval-gate coverage — gap 2 (the safety hole)

CLI-auto-approved tools currently bypass the deny-list, task-mode gate, and blocking PreToolUse hooks; hooks fire informationally after execution (`chat_runner.py:1623-1632`).

- **Owner: core seam (mode forwarding + gate) with per-dialect knobs in the bundles; residue is an upstream limitation, documented.**
- **Mechanism:** make the host the permission authority wherever the protocol allows. For Zed dialects (claude-code, codex): stop leaving the CLI in its own default-allow mode — forward the *most-restrictive* native mode (`default`, never `acceptEdits`/`dontAsk`/`bypassPermissions` except the explicit unattended path in §2.3) and, where the adapter supports it, configure "always ask" so every tool emits `session/request_permission` and therefore hits the existing host gate (`chat_runner.py:1771-1795`) — deny-list, task-mode, blocking PreToolUse, trust/YOLO all then apply uniformly. The claude-code isolation path already strips `permissions.allow/ask` + `defaultMode` from the CLI config (`apps/claude-code-agent/provider.py:106-164`) — extend that from opt-in hardening to the bundled default for host-managed sessions.
- **Honest boundary:** some CLI-internal reads/operations may never surface a permission request regardless of mode (Phase 1 step 2 measures exactly which, per provider). Those are **documented as a known constraint** in §2.7's parity doc — the host cannot pre-gate what the protocol never shows it. We do NOT build an ACP-side syscall-shim wrapper to intercept them; the OS sandbox wrap (`transport.py:316`) remains the outer boundary for those, and the SEL audit of EVENT_TOOL_CALL remains the detection layer.
- **Acceptance:** with task-mode=Ask, a file write via any ACP provider produces a host approval card (or is blocked) — never a silent write; the deny-list rejects a denied command at the permission prompt with the standard denial message; PreToolUse blocking hooks fire pre-execution on every permission-surfaced tool. The residual not-gateable set per provider is enumerated in the parity doc, not discovered by users. **Landed form (`AAP-5`):** the enumeration lives in `acp/permission_authority.NOT_GATEABLE` — a per-provider registry where each entry carries the reason and the observation that proved it, and every provider is listed even when its residual set measured EMPTY, so "no entry" can never read as "gated". §2.7's parity doc RENDERS that registry rather than re-deriving it, which keeps the prose from drifting out of sync with the gate.

### 2.3 Unattended + loop support — gaps 3 and 5 (loops work on ACP)

- **Owner: core seam, with a documented kiro limitation.**
- **Unattended (gap 3):** stop popping `unattended` at the bridge for ACP (`provider_bridge.py:534`); thread it to the ACP session setup where it maps to what the dialect *can* do: Zed dialects → `bypassPermissions` (already the loop manager's move, `loop/manager.py:181` — unify so cron/scheduled runs get it too, not just loops) **plus** host-side fail-fast: any `session/request_permission` arriving on an unattended ACP session is auto-denied-with-reason and the turn continues or aborts per loop policy (the native T5 semantic: never wedge waiting for a human). kiro (no mode axis) gets the fail-fast half only — an unattended kiro loop can still run, and every interactive prompt resolves deterministically instead of wedging. That asymmetry is documented.
- **Loop guards (gap 5):** the breaker doesn't need to move into the CLI — the host already sees every EVENT_TOOL_CALL/EVENT_TOOL_RESULT in the neutral stream. Extract the counting/threshold logic from `_FailureBreaker` + `record_structural` (`runtime.py:70-215`) into a runtime-agnostic observer consumed by `chat_runner` for ACP sessions: consecutive-failure warn/block thresholds and no-progress/ping-pong detection produce the same steering injections (as queued user-visible notices + turn-abort at the circuit threshold) that the native loop gets. **Boundary:** the native breaker can *block the next tool call pre-execution*; the ACP observer can only abort/steer *between* protocol events — stated in the doc, not papered over.
- **Acceptance:** an unattended Code loop bound to each of the three providers runs to completion or fails fast — never wedges; a deliberately failing-tool ACP session trips the circuit and aborts the turn with the standard breaker message.

### 2.4 Resume — gap 6

- **Owner: agent app bundles (registration) + core seam (dir provisioning).**
- Each bundle's `register_acp_cli_entry` call passes a `session_files_dir` (e.g. `~/.gideon/acp_sessions/<provider>/`); the core registration helper creates it. The `client.py:388-414` load path then finds its session file and `session/load` becomes live for capability-negotiating CLIs. Phase 1 step 5 gives the per-provider baseline; post-fix, re-run it.
- **Honest boundary:** `loadSession` is capability-gated per CLI — where a CLI doesn't advertise it, the compressed-history bootstrap (already WIRED) remains the documented behavior, and the activity line says so ("Session restored from history") rather than implying a protocol resume.
- **Acceptance:** gateway restart mid-conversation on a resume-capable provider produces "Session resumed" and full-fidelity continuation; non-capable providers degrade to compressed history with accurate UI labeling.

### 2.5 Learning + fidelity — gaps 4, 7, 8

- **Procedural-memory drain (gap 4) — owner: core seam.** Same pattern as §2.3: the neutral event stream already carries tool name/args/result/success for every ACP tool call. Build the M5d outcome-accumulation off `chat_runner`'s EVENT_TOOL_CALL/EVENT_TOOL_RESULT handling for ACP sessions (the native runtime keeps its in-loop accumulator), draining into the same store `drain_tool_outcomes` feeds. Incognito/restricted guards apply identically (they already live in `chat_runner`).
- **Typed tool-result meta (gap 7) — owner: core seam, best-effort by construction.** `translate.py` already extracts structured `rawInput` (`translate.py:104-141`) — populate the AgentEvent's structured-input field from it so `_redact_tool_input_obj` renders schema-driven fields instead of returning None (`chat_runner.py:286-318`); map ACP tool_kind + strReplace-style frames to the file-change diff-chip path by *kind*, not by the native-only `_WRITE_FILE_TOOLS` name set (`chat_runner.py:352-418`). `content_type`/`raw_ref`/`recovery_hints` on results remain native-richer — the protocol doesn't carry them; the meta stays empty where the frames are empty (the existing `chat_runner.py:1704` behavior), documented. No fabricated meta.
- **risk_level plumbing (gap 8) — owner: core seam.** `resolve_effective_risk` today falls back to name/kind/bash heuristics for ACP (no declared risk_level, `runtime.py:597` is native-only). Add a declared-risk map for the *known* surfaces: gideon-core MCP tools carry their native `ToolDefinition` risk levels through the MCP server's tool listing (they're the same tools — the declaration exists, it just doesn't survive the round-trip), and ACP `tool_kind` (read/edit/execute/…) feeds a kind→floor mapping. CLI-proprietary tools stay heuristic — documented.
- **Acceptance:** after an ACP turn using a gideon-core tool, a procedural outcome row exists (and none under incognito); an ACP edit-tool turn shows a diff chip and structured input fields; the approval card for a gideon-core destructive tool shows its declared risk chip, not the heuristic one.

### 2.6 Dialect asymmetry closure (gap 9) + project stamping (gap 10)

- **Plan-mode for kiro — owner: upstream CLI limitation, documented + host-compensated.** The default dialect has no mode axis (`set_mode_request` → None). No shadow mechanism: the host task-mode gate already blocks non-plan mutations at the permission prompt (§2.2 makes that coverage real), and the parity doc states kiro "plans" by host enforcement, not native CLI behavior.
- **Reasoning effort for kiro — upstream limitation, documented.** The composer effort pill greys out (not silently no-ops) when the bound dialect returns None for `set_effort_request` — the UI tells the truth (small core-seam change: surface dialect capabilities in the discovered-agent payload).
- **Personas for claude/codex — upstream limitation, documented.** One base agent per Zed adapter; the picker simply doesn't offer a persona axis for them (already the behavior — confirm no dead UI).
- **P9 concurrent sessions for claude/codex — upstream unproven, documented.** `supports_concurrent_sessions=False` stays until a spike proves the Zed adapters can interleave (out of scope here; noted as a future spike).
- **Slash commands — core seam, capability-gated.** `stream_command` routes to protocol `commands/execute` where negotiated (claude today, `client.py:537-548`); where not, the existing plain-prompt fallback stands and the UI labels the command as "sent as text" — Phase 1 step 7 determines codex/kiro reality.
- **project_id stamping (gap 10) — owner: core seam.** Stop popping `project_id` for ACP (`provider_bridge.py:541`); thread it into the gideon-core MCP server's per-session context (the session key already crosses via `GIDEON_SESSION_KEY` — resolve project binding server-side in `mcp_core` from the session, exactly how the native runtime binds it per turn per `session.py:1088`). Then `artifact_save` from an ACP session stamps the right project with zero protocol change. `extra_tool_roots` (brownfield loops): same session-side resolution for gideon-core file tools; the CLI's *own* file tools remain confined only by CLI settings + sandbox — documented. Mid-turn queue-steering (`#37`) stays native-only: the ACP protocol has no mid-turn injection seam (`chat_runner.py:1458-1462`) — the queue-then-drain behavior is the documented ACP semantic.

### 2.7 The parity doc (the honest-boundary deliverable)

`docs/agents/acp-parity.md` — the per-provider capability statement generated from the Phase 1 verified matrices + the Phase 2 end-state: what is at parity, what is host-compensated, and what is a protocol/CLI constraint (with the upstream issue to watch, where one exists). Linked from each agent app's README and the discovered-agents UI ("capability notes"). This is where "no dual paths" lands: every ABSENT that stays ABSENT is written down with its reason.

**Phase 2 effort: ~6 sessions** — (a) MCP reachability 1.5 (two prongs × three CLIs); (b) approval-gate coverage 1; (c) unattended + loop guards 1; (d) resume 0.5; (e) learning + fidelity 1; (f) dialect closure + project stamping + parity doc 1. Each fix closes with a re-run of the relevant §6 checklist steps on all three providers (mutate → persistence → consumers).

---

## Provider-Fidelity Wiring (where each piece plugs in)

- **No new provider TYPE, no new dialect.** All fixes ride the existing `acp_agent` ProviderEntry shape, the three existing dialects, and the neutral AgentEvent stream. The only registration change is bundles passing `session_files_dir` (§2.4).
- **Bridge kwargs:** `unattended` (§2.3) and `project_id` (§2.6) stop being popped for ACP at `provider_bridge.py:528-541`; `dry_run` and `extra_tool_roots` (for CLI-native tools) remain native-only — documented, not shadowed.
- **Config seeding is marker-scoped + reversible** (§2.1 prong B): the prompt-seed contract — never clobber user CLI config outside our block, remove on disable exactly what we wrote, SEL-audit every seed/unseed.
- **SEL:** auto-denied unattended permission requests, breaker trips on ACP sessions, and config seeds/unseeds all log to `sel.py`.
- **Tests:** the extracted breaker/observer gets unit tests off synthetic event streams; gate-coverage gets a regression test asserting task-mode=Ask blocks a permission-surfaced write for a fake ACP provider; `register_acp_cli_entry` gains a test that a registered bundle produces a live `session_files_dir`.

---

## Implementation Effort

**~9 sessions total: Phase 1 ≈ 3 (one per provider, claude-code → codex → kiro-cli), Phase 2 ≈ 6.**

Phase 2 order is severity order and each step is independently shippable; if Phase 1 reorders severity (e.g. protocol-passed `mcpServers` turns out to Just Work on all three, collapsing §2.1 to half a session), resequence accordingly.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| CLIs ignore protocol-passed `mcpServers` → prong A dead | Prong B (config seeding) is designed in from the start, not a fallback scramble; Phase 1 step 1 answers this before any fix code |
| Forcing always-ask mode makes ACP chats approval-spammy | trust_reads / trust-session / per-agent floors already auto-resolve safe requests at the host gate (`chat_runner.py:1927+, 1138-1170`) — the gate seeing MORE requests is the point; UX cost is bounded by the existing auto-approve ladder, and §2.5's declared-risk plumbing makes trust_reads accurate for core tools |
| Config seeding corrupts a user's CLI setup | Marker-scoped blocks, idempotent re-seed, removal keyed to our own writes, SEL audit; claude-code prefers the isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` where nothing of the user's is touched |
| Host-side breaker double-fires against a CLI's own retry logic | Thresholds start at the native values but the observer only warns/aborts — it never mutates the CLI's loop; Phase 1's failing-tool cycle calibrates before enabling by default |
| kiro mwinit staleness pollutes Phase 1 findings | Explicit precondition: check auth first in the kiro session; auth failures recorded as ENV, not as capability verdicts |
| Parity doc rots as CLIs/adapters update | It's generated from the checked-in verified matrices; re-running the §6 checklist is the documented refresh procedure, and each entry names the CLI/adapter version it was verified against |
| Scope creep into patching upstream CLIs | Hard rule in §2.7: protocol/CLI limits get documented, never shimmed; anything requiring upstream change is filed as a watch item, not built |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Phase 1:** three checked-in verified matrix columns (every audit cell CONFIRMED or DIVERGED at runtime) + a severity-ranked gap inventory; zero UNKNOWN cells remain for any provider.
2. A chat bound to each of the three providers can list and successfully invoke `knowledge_search`, `task_create`, `notify`, and `subagent_run` (with correct completion inject-back) — the gideon-core surface is reachable on all three.
3. With task-mode=Ask, a file write attempted via any ACP provider is gated by a host approval card or blocked — never silently executed; the deny-list and blocking PreToolUse hooks apply to every permission-surfaced ACP tool; the residual not-gateable set is enumerated per provider in the parity doc.
4. An unattended Code loop bound to each provider runs without wedging: Zed dialects execute via `bypassPermissions`, kiro fail-fasts interactive prompts deterministically; a failing-tool ACP session trips the host-side breaker and aborts with the standard message.
5. Gateway restart mid-conversation on a resume-capable provider shows "Session resumed" with full continuity; non-capable providers show accurate compressed-history labeling.
6. After an ACP turn: procedural outcomes are recorded (and suppressed under incognito), edit-tools render diff chips + structured input fields, and gideon-core tools show declared (not heuristic) risk on approval cards.
7. ACP `artifact_save` stamps the session's bound project; the composer effort pill is greyed (not no-op) on kiro; every remaining ABSENT is documented in `docs/agents/acp-parity.md` with its reason — a user binding one ACP provider can discover the platform's true shape from that one page instead of by tripping over it.

## Phase 1 results — claude-code verified matrix (atom `AAP-1`)

**Swept:** 2026-08-17 · **Adapter:** `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` 0.60.0 ·
**CLI:** `claude` 2.1.233.669 (ASBX Claude Code, channel stable) · **Node** v24.18.0 ·
**Host:** this repo at `b01cb76e`, isolated `GIDEON_HOME`, gateway on `:10421`,
`GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none`, `GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE` **unset** (the bundle default).

**Method.** The `claude-code-agent` bundle was installed from the first-party apps dir into
the isolated home (`POST /api/apps`), which registered the `acp:claude-code` ProviderEntry; a
dashboard chat session was bound to it (`POST /api/chat/sessions/{s}/acp-agent`) and driven
through the audit §6 checklist over the same HTTP/SSE + WebSocket surfaces the dashboard
itself uses — `POST /api/chat` for the turn (SSE), `/api/ws` for the activity and telemetry
lines the SSE stream does not carry, and the persisted `sessions/*.jsonl`,
`security_events.jsonl`, `memory.db`, `learning.db` and `session_map.json` under the isolated
home for the state half of every mutate → persist → consume cycle. Every mark below names the
command or artifact that produced it so a reader can re-run it.

**Marks.** `CONFIRMED` — the runtime matches the audit's predicted verdict for that cell.
`DIVERGED` — it does not; the observed verdict replaces the predicted one. For the audit's
`UNKNOWN` cells the prediction is the §5 gap text and the mark records the now-definite
verdict. `NOT-EXERCISED` — no runtime observation was obtained, with the reason stated;
reading the code and reasoning that a cell *should* work is explicitly **not** a mark.

### Observation ledger

Every mark in the matrix below cites one of these. `S1` = `chat-1-…` (bound after creation),
`S2` = `chat-2-…` (workspace-dir set *before* binding).

| id | what was run | what was observed |
|---|---|---|
| `O1` | `POST /api/apps` with the first-party `claude-code-agent` dir, then `GET /api/agent-providers` | `acp:claude-code` registered, `ready: true`, `state: ready`, `detail: "initialize OK (caps: _meta, auth, loadSession, mcpCapabilities, promptCapabilities, providers, sessionCapabilities)"` — **`loadSession` IS advertised** by adapter 0.60.0 |
| `O2` | `GET /api/agent-providers/acp:claude-code/agents` | one agent (`id: acp:claude-code`, `provider_agent: ""`) → no persona axis; `models` = 14 discovered ids (`default`, `…opus-4-6…` … `…haiku-4-5…`); `supported_efforts` = low/medium/high/xhigh/max; `permission_modes` = `default, acceptEdits, plan, dontAsk, bypassPermissions` |
| `O3` | `POST /api/chat/sessions/{S1}/acp-agent {provider: "acp:claude-code"}` then `GET …/{S1}` | `acp_provider: "acp:claude-code"` — ephemeral discovered-agent binding round-trips |
| `O4` | S1 turn: "List your available tool names verbatim … state YES or NO for each of: knowledge_search, task_create, notify" | the CLI's own tool set only (Agent, Bash, Edit, Read, Skill, ToolSearch, Write, Workflow, + deferred Cron*/WebFetch/…); `knowledge_search` **NO**, `task_create` **NO**, `notify` **NO**. No `mcp__gideon*` server. The reply also volunteered that "the session context references Gideon-style tools (`memory_remember`, `skill_invoke`, `knowledge_create`) … not in my actual tool list" — i.e. the *index* arrived as prompt text while the *tools* did not. The spawned CLI DID list the operator's own MCP servers (builder-mcp, slack-mcp, …) as connecting |
| `O5` | S1 turn: read `probe.txt`, write `written.txt`, `rm -f doomed.txt`; polled `GET /api/chat/sessions` for `pending_approval_info` and resolved each with `POST …/approve {action:"approved"}` | **four consecutive host approval cards** — `Terminal` (bash), `Read File`, `Write`, `Terminal` (`rm`). Every tool of the turn surfaced `session/request_permission`; none executed silently. Each card's `tool_kind` was **`""`** (empty) and `tool_input` was the adapter's `rawInput` JSON as a **string** |
| `O6` | the same turn's `/api/ws` frames | `tool_call` frames carry `kind` (`execute`/`read`/`edit`) and `input_preview` (raw JSON text) but `input: null`; `tool_result` frames carry `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []`; **zero** `diff` / `file_change` / `old_string` / `new_string` keys in the entire capture |
| `O7` | the same turn's activity frames | `Session created · default · auto · via acp:claude-agent-acp`; `Turn complete: 106 events, 6 tool calls, context 0%`; one `context_usage` frame with `pct: 0.0`; a `chat_check_work_offer` frame; an `agent_request` inbox notification whose body read "(risk: destructive)" for a read-only `pwd; ls` |
| `O8` | S2 (workspace_dir = `…/.dev-home/scratch` set BEFORE binding, `GIDEON_HOME=…/.dev-home`), turn: "Run exactly one Bash command: pwd" | no approval card (read-only-bash auto-resolved); `pwd` → **`/Users/golani/.gideon/workspace`**. Neither the session's `workspace_dir` nor the configured `GIDEON_HOME` reached the ACP process; the file the CLI later wrote landed in the operator's real home |
| `O9` | S2's activity frames | `Injected 11,560 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)` — turn-0 context assembly runs for an ACP turn |
| `O10` | `security_events.jsonl` under the isolated home after O5/O8 | 12 `tool_invocation` rows for the ACP turns, hash-chained, e.g. `operation: "Terminal", tool_kind: "execute", outcome: "invoked", metadata: {"risk": "destructive"}`, plus `outcome: "approved"` rows carrying the approval decision. No `risk_level` other than the heuristic one |
| `O11` | `ls .dev-home/session_pid_*.txt` | `session_pid_28787.txt` → `dashboard:chat-1-…`, `session_pid_52634.txt` → `dashboard:chat-2-…` — the session-key resolution file IS written for ACP sessions, and the two sessions hold **two different PIDs** |
| `O12` | `sqlite3 .dev-home/memory.db` + `learning.db` after the 6-tool-call ACP turn | `semantic_memory`, `episodic_memories`, `memory_events`, `mem_*` all `0`; `learning.db staging` `0` — no procedural-outcome row from an ACP turn |
| `O13` | S2 with `POST /api/chat/task-mode {mode:"ask"}`, then "Use your Write tool right now to create … ask-mode-probe.txt" | the write was **blocked**, not executed: `tool_result` = "Tool permission request failed: Error: Tool use aborted" and the tool line read `Write … (Ask mode — only read-only tools run (switch to Agent to make changes))`. The file was never created. A follow-up **read-only** `ls` bash was denied by the same gate |
| `O14` | S2 in `plan`, "Quote verbatim every line of your context containing 'Task mode'" | the reply quoted `## Task mode: Agent` — but from **replayed sibling-session history**, not the live framing. Re-run on a FRESH session (S3) created with `task_mode=plan` before its first turn quoted `## Task mode: Plan` and "Plan mode is active… you MUST NOT make any edits" → the framing is live and correct; the stale line was history |
| `O15` | S3's first-turn context (fresh session) | `Injected 18,394 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)` and the quoted context contained verbatim user/assistant turns from a DIFFERENT dashboard session — cross-session recall reaches an ACP turn |
| `O16` | killed the gateway, restarted it, then sent a turn on the SAME session S3 | `GET /api/chat/sessions` now reports S3 with `acp_provider: ""`, `task_mode: "agent"`, `workspace_dir: ""`; the turn resolved on the **native** axis and errored `no model provider resolves for use case 'chat'`. `gateway.log`: `Pool decision: key=dashboard:chat-3-… resume_sid=None …` — no `session/load` was attempted. `session_map.json` holds a sid for the session (`2cb03780-…`) but records no `cwd` |
| `O17` | S4: `workspace_dir` set to `…/.dev-home/scratch`, provider bound, one `pwd`; DEBUG logging on | `gateway.log`: `Pool decision: key=dashboard:chat-1-1786980914 … cwd=/private/tmp/aap1-wt/.dev-home/scratch pool_cwd=/private/tmp/aap1-wt/.dev-home/scratch` — the cwd DID reach `get_or_create`; the ACP process still answered `pwd` → `/Users/golani/.gideon/workspace`. The cwd is dropped between `get_or_create` and the spawn |
| `O18` | `grep -in "set_config_option\|session/new\|mcpServers\|set_mode" gateway.log` at DEBUG | nothing — the host logs no ACP wire frames, so mode/`mcpServers` forwarding cannot be observed from the host's own logs; the marks below that depend on it are taken from CLI-observable behavior instead |
| `O19` | S5: provider bound, `task_mode=plan` set BEFORE the first turn, then "Use the Write tool now to create … pm3.txt" | the CLI did **not** call `Write`. It emitted a `"Ready to code?"` permission request whose `tool_input.plan` says "My CLI permission mode is `plan`, which forbids writing anywhere except this plan file"; its final reply says "Permission mode: `plan` (Claude Code's CLI plan mode)". Rejecting the card left the file uncreated. On S4, where `plan` was set MID-conversation, the same request produced a plain `Write` attempt and the CLI reported "Agent" mode |
| `O20` | S6 bound with `{model: "global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-…", reasoning_effort: "low"}`, then "Name the exact model id you are running as" | the bind echoed both values; the activity line read `Session created · default · global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0 · via acp:claude-agent-acp`; the CLI answered "Model: `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`; reasoning effort not specified in session context" |
| `O21` | S6: "Run this exact bash command: `git push --dry-run .`" | `tool_result` = "Permission denied: Permission to use Bash with command git push --dry-run . has been denied." **No `approval` frame reached the host** and `security_events.jsonl` contains **zero** rows mentioning `push` — the denial came from the CLI's own deny list, not the host's, and left no SEL row |
| `O22` | S6: a correction turn ("No - stop doing that. Always answer me in exactly one sentence…") | two `activity_event` frames of kind `learned`: `Learned: never more` and `Learned: User correction to honor: No - stop doing that…`. The CLI also wrote a memory file into the operator's real `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` |
| `O23` | S6: sent the literal message `/compact` | the turn hard-failed: `Prompt error: {'code': -32601, 'message': '"Method not found": _vendor.dev/commands/execute'}`. No plain-prompt fallback ran. SEL logged `slash_command` with `outcome: bypass` |
| `O24` | S6 in `ask` mode: "Attempt these six Write tool calls one after another without stopping, even if each one fails" | **six** consecutive `tool_result` failures in ONE turn ("Tool permission request failed: Error: Tool use aborted"), then `Turn complete: 106 events, 6 tool calls`. No warn, no block, no circuit abort, no steering injection — the native breaker's warn@3 / block@5 / circuit thresholds never fired |
| `O25` | `POST …/{S6}/regenerate` then `POST …/{S6}/fork` | the regenerated assistant message carries `variants` + `variant_idx`; the fork created `chat-4-…` with 24 messages — but the fork's `acp_provider` is `""`, so the branch does not inherit the ACP binding |
| `O26` | `POST /api/chat` with a second message while a turn was in flight | **inconclusive** — the probe turn (count to 40) finished 1.2 s before the second message landed, so the two never overlapped; `queue` stayed `null` and the second message ran as its own turn. Recorded as not-exercised rather than as a queue verdict |

### 4a. Prompt-side context — claude-code column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory recall injection (turn-0 context) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O9`, `O15` — the injection line fires and the CLI quoted injected memory/history text back verbatim |
| Knowledge context (@-mention + picker `meta.knowledge`) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | the specific injector was never driven; only the generic message-text assembly was observed (`O9`). Residual — see §"Residual not-exercised cells" |
| Attachments/paste (extracted text prepended) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above; no attachment/paste `meta` was sent |
| @prompt expansion (+ typed vars, snippets) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above; no `@prompt` mention was sent |
| Skills index in context + `skill_invoke`/`skill_search` execution | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `O4` — the CLI reported the index arrived as prompt text ("the session context references … `skill_invoke`") while the tools themselves are absent from its list |
| Session-live skill drafts (`skill_remember`) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `O4` — same measurement: no `skill_remember` in the CLI's tool list |
| Task-mode framing (Agent/Ask/Plan/Build suffix) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O14` — a fresh plan-mode session's context contains `## Task mode: Plan` + "Plan mode is active… you MUST NOT make any edits" |
| Agent profile system prompt / voice layer | PARTIAL | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no agent profile with a distinctive `system_prompt` was bound, so the "CLI's own prompt dominates" half was not measured |
| Project binding (context preamble + cwd) | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | PARTIAL — preamble only | `O8`, `O17` — the preamble/context half works, but the cwd half does not: `cwd` reaches `get_or_create` and the ACP process still runs in `~/.gideon/workspace` |
| project_id → artifact stamping | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT (stronger) | `O4` — `artifact_save` is not reachable at all on claude-code, so there is nothing to stamp |
| Persona injection (Lumon theme) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | the persona toggle was never enabled during the sweep |
| Cancelled-turn preamble re-injection | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no turn was interrupted mid-flight |
| Compressed thread-history bootstrap (new process) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O14`, `O15` — a brand-new session's context replayed prior turns verbatim, including sibling-session history |

### 4b. Approvals / permissions / safety — claude-code column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interactive approval cards | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O5` — four cards in one turn, each resolvable via `POST …/approve` |
| trust_reads (effective-safe auto-approve) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `O8` — a read-only `pwd` auto-resolved with no card; `O7`/`O10` — the same heuristic labelled a read-only `pwd; ls` "destructive", so the downgrade is name/kind-based and coarse |
| Trust (session) / YOLO (global) auto-approve | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | every card was resolved with `approved`/`rejected`; `trust` and YOLO were never used |
| Per-agent approval floor ("Always allow") | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no agent profile with `approval_mode: auto` was bound |
| Task-mode enforcement BEFORE approval (trust can't bypass) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL — but the measured residual is narrow | `O13` (ask blocks `Write` AND a read-only `ls`), `O19`/`O24` (plan blocks every `Write`), and the SEL rows carry `reason: task_mode:ask` / `task_mode:plan`. Across 44 SEL-audited ACP tool events (24 `invoked`, 11 `denied`, 4 `approved`, 3 `surfaced`, 1 `rejected`, 1 `bypass`) **no tool executed without reaching the host gate**; the only non-surfacing case was a CLI-side *denial* (`O21`) |
| Plan mode → native backend plan | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED (with a caveat) | `O19` — the CLI itself reports "Claude Code's CLI plan mode" and substitutes `"Ready to code?"` for the edit. Caveat: honored only when plan is set BEFORE the session's first turn |
| Hard deny-list (`security.is_denied`) pre-execution | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O21` — the host never pre-blocked; the denial that did occur came from the CLI and produced no SEL row |
| PreToolUse hooks blocking execution | PARTIAL | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no PreToolUse hook was installed during the sweep |
| PostToolUse / Stop / SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Error hooks | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above — no hooks were installed |
| SEL audit of every executed tool + effective risk | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED (with one blind spot) | `O10` — hash-chained `tool_invocation` rows with `tool_kind` and `metadata.risk` for every ACP tool, plus `approved`/`denied`/`rejected` decisions. Blind spot: a CLI-side denial is invisible (`O21`) |
| Unattended mode (strip interactive tools + fail-fast approvals, T5) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | requires an unattended loop/cron run; this isolated home has **no model provider configured**, so a loop fails on provider resolution before any ACP worker turn (`O16` shows the same error shape) |
| Dry-run replay (T9 observe mode) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | `dry_run` has no dashboard entry point to drive as-a-user |
| OS sandbox wrap of the agent process | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | sandbox mode was left at its default; no confinement boundary was probed |
| Isolated CLI config hardening (`GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE`) | WIRED (opt-in) | CONFIRMED off-by-default, and the default measurably leaks | opt-in, and OFF is the shipped default | with the flag unset the spawned CLI loaded the operator's real `~/.claude` — it enumerated the operator's own MCP servers (`O4`) and wrote into `~/.claude/plans/` and `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` (`O19`, `O22`) |

### 4c. Tools — claude-code column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Filesystem/shell tools (cwd-confined + extra_tool_roots) | PARTIAL | **DIVERGED** — worse | PARTIAL, and NOT cwd-confined to the session's workspace | `O8`, `O17` — the CLI's own `Read`/`Write`/`Terminal` run in `~/.gideon/workspace` regardless of the session's `workspace_dir`, and reached `/Volumes/…`, `~/.claude` and `~/.gideon` freely (`O5`, `O19`, `O22`) |
| Full native tool registry (knowledge/tasks/loops/inbox/memory/artifacts/workflows/subagents/web/schedule) | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED (§5 gap 1 predicted "likely absent") | **ABSENT** | `O4` — `knowledge_search` NO, `task_create` NO, `notify` NO; no `gideon-core` MCP server in the CLI's tool list |
| Tool disable prefs (PT3/UT4 per-tool + per-provider) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no tool-disable pref was set during the sweep |
| Per-turn tool retrieval + progressive disclosure (`tool_search`/`tool_schema`) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O4` — the CLI enumerated only its OWN tools (including its own `ToolSearch`); no host-injected retrieval tools appeared |
| Failure breaker (warn@3/block@5/circuit@30) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O24` — six consecutive failures in one turn, zero warn/block/circuit output |
| Structural loop detection (no-progress/ping-pong) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O24` — six identically-shaped failing calls, no steering injection or abort |
| Typed tool-result meta (content_type/raw_ref/truncated/recovery_hints/ok) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT (empty, not fabricated) | `O6` — every `tool_result` carries `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []` |
| Structured tool-input rendering (dict → schema-driven fields) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O6` — `input: null` on every frame; only `input_preview` (the raw `rawInput` JSON as text) is populated. `O5` — the approval card's `tool_input` is likewise a string |
| File-change diff chips (write/edit before-after) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — and the raw material IS present | `O6` — zero `diff`/`file_change`/`old_string`/`new_string` keys, while the first `tool_call` frame of each call DOES carry `kind: "edit"`, which is exactly the by-kind signal §2.5 proposes |
| AskUserQuestion card | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED (audit: fires only if the CLI exposes an identically-named tool) | **ABSENT** | `O4` — the CLI's full tool list contains no `AskUserQuestion`, and the MCP route that could supply one is unreachable |
| Subagents (`subagent_run` + completion inject-back) | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED (audit: only via gideon-core MCP if reachable) | **ABSENT** — though its session-key precondition holds | `O4` — no `subagent_run` tool. `O11` — the `session_pid_<pid>.txt` file the inject-back depends on IS written for ACP sessions, so only the tool itself is missing |
| MCP tools (external servers) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL — and the subset is the OPERATOR'S, not Gideon's | `O4` — the spawned CLI enumerated builder-mcp / slack-mcp / aws-mcp / chrome-devtools from the operator's own `~/.claude` config; nothing from Gideon's `mcp.json` |
| Queue-steering mid-turn (#37) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | `O26` — the mid-turn send probe missed the window; neither steer nor queue was observed |

### 4d. Learning / memory — claude-code column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Preference-facet capture (every turn) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O22` — `activity_event` kind `learned`: "Learned: never more" (a poor extraction, but the path ran) |
| Correction→lesson review | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O22` — "Learned: User correction to honor: …" fired on the correction turn, with no model provider needed |
| Procedural-outcome capture (M5d tool-outcome drain) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O12` — after a 6-tool-call ACP turn, `memory.db` (`semantic_memory`, `episodic_memories`, `memory_events`, `mem_*`) and `learning.db staging` were all `0` |
| Skill-ladder review (4-tier, propose-only) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | the ladder's expensive review needs a model provider, which this isolated home lacks |
| Memory consolidation on session end | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | same reason — consolidation is a model call |
| Incognito/restricted no-write guarantees | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no incognito/restricted session was driven |

### 4e. Session / conversation mechanics — claude-code column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Variants / regenerate (‹n/N› switcher) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O25` — the regenerated assistant message carries `variants` + `variant_idx` |
| Edit & resend, branch continuation (fork) | WIRED | CONFIRMED with a caveat | WIRED, but the branch loses the runtime | `O25` — the fork carries all 24 messages and `acp_provider: ""` |
| Queued messages (merge/pop + live bubbles) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | `O26` — probe missed the in-flight window |
| Empty-turn auto-retry | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no empty turn occurred across ~14 turns; not forceable as-a-user |
| Auto-nudge re-arm (loops) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | loop-only; blocked by the same missing model provider as the unattended cell |
| Context-% accounting | PARTIAL (UNKNOWN which backends emit) | **DIVERGED** | the chip is EMITTED but always reports a fabricated `0%` | `O7` — a `context_usage` frame with `pct: 0.0` and `Turn complete: 106 events, 6 tool calls, context 0%`; every one of ~14 turns reported `0%`, including turns with 18 KB of injected context |
| Compaction | WIRED (CLI-owned `/compact`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT via the host — the command path errors | `O23` — `/compact` returns `-32601 "Method not found": _vendor.dev/commands/execute` |
| Slash commands (via `stream_command`) | WIRED (protocol `commands/execute`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT — and there is NO plain-prompt fallback | `O23` — the turn hard-errors instead of degrading to a text prompt |
| Session resume across gateway restarts (`session/load`) | PARTIAL (falls to `session/new` + compressed history) | **DIVERGED** — worse | ABSENT, and the runtime silently changes | `O1` — the adapter DOES advertise `loadSession`. `O16` — after a restart the session's `acp_provider`, `task_mode` and `workspace_dir` are all cleared, `resume_sid=None` (no `session/load` attempted), and the next turn resolves on the **native** axis |
| Warm pool / instant start | WIRED | CONFIRMED (pool present, cold on this run) | WIRED-but-cold | `O17` — `Pool decision: … pool_size=0 pool_qsize=0`, so every turn cold-started; the pool path exists and was exercised, it just had nothing warm |
| Concurrent sessions on one process (P9) | ABSENT (dialect False) | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `O11` — two concurrently-bound claude-code sessions hold two DIFFERENT adapter PIDs |
| Pipe-death auto-retry / re-queue | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no adapter process was killed mid-turn |
| Model override per session (composer picker) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `O20` — the CLI named the exact pinned model id back |
| Reasoning effort per turn | WIRED | CONFIRMED host-side only | host forwards it; CLI-honoring unobserved | `O2` — the adapter advertises five efforts, so the axis exists. `O20` — the host accepted and echoed `low`, but the CLI cannot self-report its effort, so "honored" was not measured |
| Agent/persona selection | ABSENT (no persona axis) | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — and no dead UI | `O2` — discovery returns exactly one agent with `provider_agent: ""`, so the picker has no persona rows to offer |
| Discovered-agent ephemeral binding (chat picker → `POST …/acp-agent`) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED, and *ephemeral* is literal | `O3` — the bind round-trips. `O16`/`O25` — it does not survive a gateway restart or a fork |
| Turn telemetry (event/tool counts, tokens, cost estimate) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED (counts), context-% fabricated | `O7` — `Turn complete: 106 events, 6 tool calls, context 0%` |

### Mark counts (claude-code, 63 audit cells)

| mark | count |
|---|---|
| CONFIRMED (runtime matched the audit's prediction) | 35 |
| DIVERGED (runtime contradicted it) | 6 |
| NOT-EXERCISED (no runtime observation obtained; reasons below) | 22 |

All **four** cells the audit left literally `UNKNOWN` for claude-code are now definite:
native tool registry → **ABSENT**, `AskUserQuestion` → **ABSENT**, subagents → **ABSENT**,
context-% emission → **emitted but always 0%**. The sweep is therefore **PARTIAL against
`AAP-1`'s "zero UNKNOWN cells"**: nothing is left un-decided that the audit flagged, but 22
cells were not driven and are listed rather than guessed.

### Residual not-exercised cells (and why)

1. **Needs a model provider in the isolated home** (5): unattended mode, auto-nudge re-arm,
   skill-ladder review, memory consolidation, and the loop half of the failure-breaker check.
   A loop/cron run fails on `no model provider resolves for use case 'chat'|'background'`
   (`O16`) before any ACP worker turn happens, so a wedge/no-wedge verdict would measure the
   wrong thing.
2. **Needs a fixture that was not built** (9): knowledge @-mention, attachment/paste, @prompt
   expansion, agent-profile system prompt, per-agent approval floor, PreToolUse hooks, the
   other five hook kinds, tool-disable prefs, Lumon persona injection.
3. **Needs a timing/failure injection that did not land** (5): queued messages and
   queue-steering (`O26` — the probe turn finished 1.2 s early), cancelled-turn preamble,
   empty-turn auto-retry, pipe-death auto-retry.
4. **No as-a-user entry point** (3): dry-run replay, OS sandbox confinement probe, and
   trust/YOLO auto-approve (deliberately not enabled — every card was resolved explicitly so
   the gate itself stayed measurable).

### Gap inventory — severity-ranked (claude-code findings)

**P0 — safety**

- **`G1` The ACP process cwd escapes BOTH the session's workspace and the configured home.**
  With `workspace_dir` set to a scratch dir and `GIDEON_HOME` set to an isolated dir, the
  spawned CLI answered `pwd` → `~/.gideon/workspace` and wrote its files there (`O8`,
  `O17`). The cwd DOES reach `get_or_create` (`cwd=…/scratch` in the `Pool decision` log) and is
  dropped below it: `src/gideon/llm/acp_agent.py:771` reads `cwd` from `entry.options`
  only, so the per-call build kwarg `registry.build(…, cwd=cwd, …)` passes through `**kwargs`
  unread, and `src/gideon/acp/client.py:131` then falls back to a hardcoded
  `Path.home() / ".gideon" / "workspace"` that ignores `config_dir()`. Consequences: a
  bound Project's cwd is not honored for ACP; the CLI's file/bash tools operate inside the
  harness's own state dir; and any isolated-home deployment (dev, test, a second entity) is
  silently escaped. **Not fixed here — outside this atom's fence.** Owner: core seam, and it
  should front-run `AAP-9`'s `project_id` work since both are the same "session scope doesn't
  cross the seam" defect.
- **`G2` Host gate coverage is contingent on the operator's own `~/.claude`, not structural.**
  Measured coverage was total — 44 SEL-audited ACP tool events, every one surfaced `session/request_permission`
  (`O5`, `O13`, `O19`, `O24`) — but only because `GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE` is off by default and
  this operator's real settings happened to auto-approve nothing. The same default let the
  spawned CLI enumerate the operator's own MCP servers (`O4`) and write into `~/.claude/plans/`
  and `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` (`O19`, `O22`). An operator with `permissions.allow` entries
  gets silent execution with no host card. This is the measurement `AAP-5` needs: the fix is to
  make the isolated config the bundled default for host-managed sessions, not to add a gate.

**P1 — capability-dead**

- **`G3` No `gideon-core` surface at all** (`O4`) — knowledge, tasks, inbox, artifacts,
  workflows, subagents and `notify` are unreachable; `artifact_save` therefore cannot exist,
  which makes `project_id` stamping vacuous rather than merely unstamped. Confirms audit gap 1;
  owner `AAP-4`. The prong-A question is still open: nothing in the host logs the ACP wire, so
  whether claude-code would honor protocol-passed `mcpServers` was NOT determined (`O18`).
- **`G4` Slash commands are broken, not merely unsupported** (`O23`) — `/compact` returns
  `-32601 "Method not found": _vendor.dev/commands/execute` from adapter 0.60.0 and the turn
  **hard-errors**; the plain-prompt fallback the audit assumed does not run. The audit marked
  this cell WIRED for claude-code; it is not. Owner: core seam (capability-gate `stream_command`
  and fall back to text), `AAP-9`.
- **`G5` A gateway restart silently changes the runtime** (`O16`) — the session's `acp_provider`,
  `task_mode` and `workspace_dir` are all cleared, `resume_sid` is `None` (no `session/load`
  attempted even though the adapter advertises `loadSession`, `O1`), and the next turn resolves
  on the native axis. On this provider-less home that surfaced as an error; on a machine with a
  native model provider it would silently run a *different* runtime with different tools and
  different confinement. Strictly worse than the audit's "falls to compressed history". Owner
  `AAP-7`, and the binding-persistence half is new scope for it.
- **`G6` No host-side brake on a failing ACP loop** (`O24`) — six consecutive tool failures in
  one turn produced no warn, no block, no circuit abort and no steering injection. Confirms
  audit gap 5; owner `AAP-6`.
- **`G7` Procedural memory never learns from ACP turns** (`O12`) — zero rows after a 6-tool-call
  turn. Confirms audit gap 4; owner `AAP-8`.

**P2 — fidelity**

- **`G8` The context-% chip reports a fabricated `0%`** (`O7`) — a `context_usage` frame IS
  emitted every turn with `pct: 0.0`, and `Turn complete: … context 0%` printed `0%` on all ~14
  turns including ones carrying 18 KB of injected context. This is worse than absent: the UI
  states a number the backend never supplied. Owner `AAP-8` — the honest shape is to omit the
  chip when the backend emits no stats, not to print zero.
- **`G9` Tool-card fidelity, with the raw material already present** (`O6`) — `input: null`,
  empty result meta, zero diff keys; but each first `tool_call` frame carries
  `kind: "read"|"edit"|"execute"` and each update carries the adapter's `rawInput` JSON. Owner
  `AAP-8`; the by-kind mapping §2.5 proposes is confirmed viable at runtime.
- **`G10` Effective risk is heuristic and mis-calibrated in both directions** — a read-only
  `pwd; ls` was labelled `destructive` in the SEL row and the approval notification (`O7`,
  `O10`), while ask-mode denied a read-only `ls` outright (`O13`). Every ACP permission request
  arrived with `tool_kind: ""` (`O5`), so even the kind→floor mapping has nothing to read on the
  approval path — the `kind` lives on the `tool_call` frame, not the permission frame. Owner
  `AAP-8`; that asymmetry is a design input for §2.5.
- **`G11` A CLI-side denial is invisible to the audit trail** (`O21`) — `git push --dry-run` was
  denied by the CLI's own deny list; no `approval` frame reached the host and
  `security_events.jsonl` has zero rows for it. The host's SEL therefore under-reports what the
  CLI refused, which is the mirror image of gap 2 and belongs in the §2.7 parity doc.
- **`G12` `acp_mode` is honored only when set before a session's first turn** — plan set before
  the first turn put the CLI in real plan mode (`O19`); plan set mid-conversation produced a
  plain `Write` attempt and the CLI reported "Agent" mode, even though a new session line was
  emitted. Mechanism not isolated. Owner `AAP-9`.
- **`G13` A fork does not inherit the ACP binding** (`O25`) — the branch carries all 24 messages
  with `acp_provider: ""`. Same ephemeral-binding root as `G5`.

**P3 — cosmetic / legibility**

- **`G14` The activity line names the adapter, not the runtime the user picked** (`O7`) —
  `Session created · … · via acp:claude-agent-acp`, because
  `AcpAgentProvider.provider_id` is `f"acp:{Path(self._command[0]).name}"`
  (`src/gideon/llm/acp_agent.py:72-75`). The bundle deliberately passes the dialect
  explicitly to avoid basename inference; the label was missed. Under the npx fallback the same
  line would read `acp:npx`.
- **`G15` "Session created" prints on EVERY turn** — the line is gated on `resumed`, never on
  `is_new` (`src/gideon/dashboard/chat_runner.py:1731-1748`), so a long ACP conversation
  repeats "Session created" and never says "resumed". `AAP-7`'s accurate-labelling acceptance
  criterion needs this row too.
- **`G16` The preference-facet extractor learned the fragment "never more"** from
  "…in exactly one sentence from now on, never more." (`O22`) — the capture path is live
  (that is the CONFIRMED part) but the extraction is poor.

### Incidental bugs fixed in-session

**None.** Every defect this sweep found (`G1`, `G4`, `G5`, `G8`, `G12`, `G13`, `G14`, `G15`,
`G16`) lives outside this atom's fence — in `llm/acp_agent.py`, `acp/client.py`,
`dashboard/chat_runner.py` and the learning capture path — and `G1`/`G5` are structural enough
that the plan's own rule applies: "anything structural waits for Phase 2 so fixes land against
the full three-provider picture." They are filed above at their measured severity instead of
being half-fixed.

## Phase 1 results — codex verified matrix (atom `AAP-2`)

**Swept:** 2026-08-17 · **Adapter:** `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` 1.1.4 ·
**CLI:** `codex` 0.146.1.359 (stable) at `/Users/golani/.toolbox/bin/codex`, whose own
`~/.codex/config.toml` sets `model_provider = "amazon-bedrock"`, `model = "openai.gpt-5.6-sol"`,
`model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"` · **Node** v24.18.0 · **Host:** this repo at AAP-1's tip
(`bf0eb342`), isolated `GIDEON_HOME=/private/tmp/aap2-wt/.dev-home`, gateway on `:10431`,
`GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none`, `CODEX_ACP_BIN` pinned to the already-provisioned adapter with
`GIDEON_ACP_NO_PROVISION=1` (so the sweep performs no `npm install` side effect).

**Method.** Same shape as `AAP-1`: the `codex-agent` bundle was installed from the first-party
apps dir into the isolated home (`POST /api/apps`), which registered the `acp:codex`
ProviderEntry; dashboard chat sessions were bound to it
(`POST /api/chat/sessions/{s}/acp-agent`) and driven through the audit §6 checklist over the
same HTTP/SSE + WebSocket surfaces the dashboard uses — `POST /api/chat` for the turn (SSE),
`/api/ws` for the activity, `tool_call`/`tool_result`, `approval` and telemetry frames the SSE
stream does not carry, and the persisted `sessions/*.jsonl`, `security_events.jsonl`,
`memory.db`, `learning.db` and `session_map.json` under the isolated home for the state half of
every mutate → persist → consume cycle. Every mark names the command or artifact that produced
it. **Note on isolation:** unlike the claude bundle there is no `GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE`
equivalent for codex — `GideonApps/codex-agent/provider.py` says so in its own docstring
("Codex manages its own configuration and auth, so this bundle does **not** apply the
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation the Claude bundle needs"), so every codex ACP session on this
machine runs against the operator's real `~/.codex`. That is measured below, not assumed.

**Marks.** Same vocabulary as `AAP-1`: `CONFIRMED` — the runtime matches the audit's predicted
verdict for that cell. `DIVERGED` — it does not; the observed verdict replaces the predicted
one. `NOT-EXERCISED` — no runtime observation was obtained, with the reason stated; reading the
code and reasoning that a cell *should* work is explicitly **not** a mark.

### Observation ledger (codex)

Ledger ids are `C…` so they never collide with `AAP-1`'s `O…`. `S1` = `chat-1-1787026836`
(workspace_dir set to `…/.dev-home/scratch` **before** binding).

| id | what was run | what was observed |
|---|---|---|
| `C1` | `POST /api/apps` with the first-party `codex-agent` dir, then `GET /api/agent-providers` | `acp:codex` registered, `ready: true`, `state: ready`, `detail: "initialize OK (caps: auth, loadSession, mcpCapabilities, promptCapabilities, providers, sessionCapabilities)"` — `loadSession` **is** advertised (as on claude); unlike claude there is no `_meta` capability |
| `C2` | `GET /api/agent-providers/acp:codex/agents` | one agent (`id: acp:codex`, `name: "Codex"`, `provider_agent: ""`) → no persona axis; `models` = 5 live-discovered ids (`openai.gpt-5.6-sol`, `…-terra`, `…-luna`, `openai.gpt-5.5`, `openai.gpt-5.4`); **`supported_efforts` = `[]`** (claude advertised five); `permission_modes` = the same host-side list `default, acceptEdits, plan, dontAsk, bypassPermissions` |
| `C3` | `POST …/{S1}/workspace-dir {"/private/tmp/aap2-wt/.dev-home/scratch"}` then `POST …/{S1}/acp-agent {provider:"acp:codex"}`, then `GET /api/chat/sessions` | both round-trip: `workspace_dir` = the scratch dir, `acp_provider: "acp:codex"` |
| `C4` | S1 turn 1: "Run exactly one shell command: pwd … then list your available tool names verbatim, then YES/NO for knowledge_search, task_create, notify" | `pwd` → **`/Users/golani/.gideon/workspace`** — the escape reproduces on codex. Tool list: `exec_command, write_stdin, list_mcp_resources, list_mcp_resource_templates, read_mcp_resource, update_plan, request_user_input, apply_patch, view_image, get_goal, create_goal, update_goal, tool_search_tool, parallel`; `knowledge_search` **NO**, `task_create` **NO**, `notify` **NO**; no `gideon-core` MCP server. The turn's FIRST assistant chunk was the CLI's own notice — "Warning: Skill descriptions were shortened to fit the 2% skills context budget. Codex can still see every skill…" — i.e. the operator's real `~/.codex` skills/plugins loaded, and an adapter/CLI notice is rendered to the user as assistant prose |
| `C5` | S1 turn 2: read `…/scratch/probe.txt`, create `…/scratch/written.txt`, `rm -f …/scratch/doomed.txt`; `/api/ws` captured and each card resolved with `POST …/approve {action:"approved"}` | the read auto-resolved with **no** card; the edit and the `rm` each raised one `approval` frame, both `risk: "destructive"`, both with **`tool: "unknown"`** and `tool_kind: ""`. `written.txt` was created (`HELLO`) and `doomed.txt` deleted only after approval. The sibling `tool_call` frames DO carry a real title and kind (`Read file '…'`/`read`, `Editing files`/`edit`, `rm -f …`/`execute`) and the edit's `input_preview` is a **unified diff** (`--- … +++ … @@ -0,0 +1 @@ +HELLO`), while `input` is `null` on all three; every `tool_result` carries `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []`. `Session created · default · auto · via acp:codex-acp` printed again on this second turn, and `Turn complete: 103 events, 3 tool calls, context 0%` with one `context_usage` frame `pct: 0.0` |

| `C6` | S1 with `POST /api/chat/task-mode {mode:"ask"}` set before the turn, then "quote every context line containing 'Task mode' … then use apply_patch to create `ask-mode-probe.txt`" | the write was **blocked** — a `tool_call` (`kind: edit`) frame appeared, then **no `tool_result` at all** and the turn ended with the assistant message `*Conversation interrupted*`; the file was never created. SEL: `unknown | denied | {"reason": "task_mode:ask"}`. The model's step-1 answer quoted `## Task mode: Agent` (its 4th turn on a session whose first three ran in agent mode, so live-vs-replayed could not be separated here) |
| `C7` | S2 = a FRESH session, provider bound, `task_mode=plan` set **before** its first turn, then "quote 'Task mode' lines … state your CLI's approval mode … use apply_patch to create `plan-mode-probe.txt`" | the CLI **called `apply_patch` anyway** (`tool_call`, `kind: edit`) — no `update_plan`, no plan artifact, no sign of a native plan mode. The host blocked it and the turn again ended `*Conversation interrupted*` before the model answered steps 1-2. File never created |
| `C8` | S2: sent the literal message `/compact` | identical failure to claude: `Prompt error: {'code': -32601, 'message': '"Method not found": _vendor.dev/commands/execute'}`, no plain-prompt fallback, no compaction |
| `C9` | S2: "use your `request_user_input` tool right now to ask me to choose RED or BLUE" | `request_user_input` **failed CLI-side**: "`request_user_input is unavailable in Default mode`". No host card, no `approval` frame, **no SEL row**, and the turn's telemetry counted `0 tool calls` |
| `C10` | S1: six `cat /nonexistent-aap2-probe-N` commands, one tool call each, "do not stop early"; 30 s in, a second `POST /api/chat` was sent while the turn was running | all six ran and failed (`exit_code: 1` each) → **no warn, no block, no circuit abort, no steering injection**; `Turn complete: 28 events, 6 tool calls`. The mid-turn message returned `{"ok": true, "queued": true}` and produced a `queue_push` frame with a `queue_id`; after the turn a `queue_pop` + `chat_user_message` fired and it ran as its own turn (the reply was `QUEUED`). Note the six shell calls arrived titled `Read file '…'` with `kind: read` and auto-approved as `risk: safe` |
| `C11` | S1: one compound command `cat …/probe.txt && rm -f …/canary.txt`, card policy = **reject** | the adapter titled it with the raw command, the host classified it `kind: execute` / `risk: destructive` and raised a card; rejecting it left `canary.txt` **intact** and the turn continued normally (`tool_result` with `exit_code: null`, `Turn complete`). So the read/safe auto-approve is not spoofable by hiding a mutation behind a read, and a *host rejection* is graceful |
| `C12` | S3 bound with `{model: "openai.gpt-5.4", reasoning_effort: "low"}`, then "name your exact model id; state your reasoning effort; list every MCP server available to you" | the bind echoed both values and the activity line read `Session created · default · openai.gpt-5.4 · via acp:codex-acp`; `gateway.log` shows `ACP model: openai.gpt-5.4`. The CLI answered that its model id and effort are **"not exposed to me in this session"**, and listed **12 MCP servers — all the operator's own** (`builder-mcp`, `slack-mcp`, `aws-mcp`, `pippin-mcp`, `spec-studio-mcp`, `weblab-mcp`, `sage-plus-service-mcp`, `concur-mcp`, `apd-aura-mcp`, `aurora-helios-mcp`, `change-management-mcp`, `feebas-service-mcp`) — and nothing from Gideon |
| `C13` | S3 turn 2: a correction ("No - stop doing that. Always answer me in exactly one sentence from now on, never more.") | two `activity_event`s of kind `learned`: `Learned: never more` and `Learned: User correction to honor: …` — the identical poor extraction AAP-1 measured. In the same turn `gateway.log` logged `ACP model: auto (from agent config)` for the newly spawned process — the session's pinned `openai.gpt-5.4` was **not** re-applied on turn 2, while the activity line still printed `openai.gpt-5.4` |
| `C14` | state under the isolated home after 10 turns: `ls session_pid_*.txt`, `session_map.json`, `sqlite3 memory.db`/`learning.db`, plus `ps` descendant counts | three `session_pid_<pid>.txt` files → one per session, **three different PIDs** (so no process sharing, and the subagent inject-back precondition holds). `session_map.json` holds a `sid` per session and **no `cwd`**. After turns carrying 6 and 3 tool calls: `memory_events` had **zero** rows; the only rows in `memory.db`/`learning.db` appeared after the **0-tool** correction turn (2 lesson rows + one `user.selfmodel.pending…` row whose payload is `{"pattern": "Gideon + no-tools", "tools": [], "succeeded": true}`). Each live adapter carried **31 descendant processes** (the operator's MCP fleet — `gateway.log`: `Tracked 34 descendant PIDs`), 93 across three sessions |
| `C15` | `POST …/{S1}/fork`, then `POST …/{S2}/regenerate` | the fork (`chat-4-…`) carries all 14 messages with `acp_provider: ""` — the branch loses the runtime. The regenerated assistant message carries `variants` (2) and `variant_idx: 1` |
| `C16` | killed the gateway, restarted it with the same env, inspected every session, then sent one turn on S3 | **all three** sessions came back with `acp_provider: null`, `reasoning_effort: null`, `workspace_dir: null`, `mode: null` — while S3's `model` **survived** as `openai.gpt-5.4`. The turn on S3 resolved on the **native** axis and errored `no model provider resolves for use case 'chat'`; `Pool decision: key=dashboard:chat-3-… resume_sid=None model=None` — no `session/load` attempted despite `loadSession` being advertised (`C1`) |
| `C17` | S1 re-bound, then: (a) a write card resolved with `{action:"trust"}`; (b) a second write with the poller disabled; (c) `task_mode=ask` set, then a third write | (a) `trust-a.txt` created; (b) **no card at all** — instead a second `tool_call` frame with `"auto": true` (and `tool: "unknown"`, `kind: ""`), and `trust-b.txt` created → session trust is live; (c) `trust-c.txt` was **never created** and SEL logged `unknown | denied | {"reason": "task_mode:ask"}` → **session trust does not bypass task mode** |
| `C18` | S1: `sleep 45; echo DONE-AAP2` as one tool call, then `POST …/{S1}/stop` 40 s in; afterwards a turn asking the CLI to quote any context line containing "cancel"/"interrupted" | the stop returned `{"ok": true}` and emitted a `stop_event` (`state: stopping`), and one second later the turn ended with the error **`ACP prompt timed out`** rather than a cancellation notice. The follow-up turn could not resolve the preamble question: codex **declines to quote its context** ("I can't provide hidden context or instructions") |
| `C19` | after the sweep: `find ~/.gideon ~/.codex -type f -mmin -120`, `sqlite3 -readonly ~/.codex/memories_1.sqlite`, then removal + re-verification by session id | `~/.gideon`: **zero** files written (the escaped cwd `~/.gideon/workspace` was entered but nothing was created there — every probe used absolute paths inside the isolated home). `~/.codex`: 7 conversation transcripts (`sessions/2026/08/17/rollout-…-<sid>.jsonl`) and 7 `shell_snapshots/<sid>.*.sh` keyed to this sweep's ACP session ids, plus codex's own sqlite WAL/otel/tmp churn. `memories_1.sqlite` was touched but is **empty** (`jobs: 0`, `stage1_outputs: 0`) — no memory was written. All 14 attributable files were deleted and re-verified: a `find ~/.codex -name "*<sid>*"` over all 16 sweep session ids now returns **0** |

### 4a. Prompt-side context — codex column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory recall injection (turn-0 context) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `C4`, `C7`, `C12` — `Injected 10,403 / 15,569 / 11,169 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)` on each fresh session, and `C6` shows an injected framing line quoted back verbatim |
| Knowledge context (@-mention + picker `meta.knowledge`) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no `meta` payload was sent; the specific injector was never driven |
| Attachments/paste (extracted text prepended) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above |
| @prompt expansion (+ typed vars, snippets) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above |
| Skills index in context + `skill_invoke`/`skill_search` execution | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `C4` — no `skill_invoke`/`skill_search` in the CLI's tool list, while SEL carries `skill_surface` / `surfaced` rows and `gateway.log` logs `Surfaced skills: task-and-project`: the index text goes in, the tools do not |
| Session-live skill drafts (`skill_remember`) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `C4` — no `skill_remember` in the tool list |
| Task-mode framing (Agent/Ask/Plan/Build suffix) | WIRED | CONFIRMED — presence only | the framing block IS injected; whether its value tracks the live mode was NOT separable | `C6` — the CLI quoted `## Task mode: Agent`, but on a session whose earlier turns ran in agent mode, so replayed history is an equally good explanation. `C7` (the fresh-session control) died on the tool denial before answering, and `C18` shows codex otherwise refuses to quote its context |
| Agent profile system prompt / voice layer | PARTIAL | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no agent profile with a distinctive `system_prompt` was bound |
| Project binding (context preamble + cwd) | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | the cwd half does not work | `C4` — `workspace_dir` was set to the scratch dir **before** binding and `pwd` inside the spawned CLI answered `/Users/golani/.gideon/workspace`; `gateway.log` shows `cwd=…/.dev-home/scratch pool_cwd=/Volumes/workplace/gideon-workspace`, so neither the session's dir nor the pool's reaches the process. The preamble half was not separately measured (`C18`) |
| project_id → artifact stamping | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT (stronger) | `C4` — `artifact_save` is not reachable at all, so there is nothing to stamp |
| Persona injection (Lumon theme) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | the persona toggle was never enabled |
| Cancelled-turn preamble re-injection | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | attempted: `C18` cancelled a turn mid-tool, but codex declines to quote its context, so no verdict on the re-injection |
| Compressed thread-history bootstrap (new process) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | every turn spawns a NEW adapter process (`Session created` + a new PID each turn) and continuity held across 10 turns on S1; `C6` shows prior-turn text replayed into a later turn |

### 4b. Approvals / permissions / safety — codex column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interactive approval cards | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `C5` (two cards in one turn, both resolvable), `C11` (a card rejected, the tool did not run) |
| trust_reads (effective-safe auto-approve) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `C4`/`C5`/`C10` — `pwd`, a file read and six `cat` calls auto-resolved with `risk: safe`; the classification is title-driven (the adapter titles an `exec_command` "Read file '…'"), but `C11` shows a compound command that hides a mutation behind a read is still classified `execute`/`destructive` |
| Trust (session) / YOLO (global) auto-approve | WIRED | CONFIRMED (session trust) | WIRED for session trust; YOLO not exercised | `C17` — after one `{action:"trust"}` the next write ran with no card, surfacing a `tool_call` frame with `"auto": true` |
| Per-agent approval floor ("Always allow") | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no agent profile with `approval_mode: auto` was bound |
| Task-mode enforcement BEFORE approval (trust can't bypass) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | WIRED — and the bypass question is now closed | `C17` — with session trust ACTIVE, an ask-mode write was still denied (`reason: task_mode:ask`) and the file never appeared. Also `C6`, `C7`. Across the whole sweep no ACP tool executed without passing the host gate |
| Plan mode → native backend plan | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT — plan is enforced only by the host gate | `C7` — plan set BEFORE a fresh session's first turn; the CLI still called `apply_patch` and never called `update_plan`. This is the shape the audit predicted for kiro, not for codex |
| Hard deny-list (`security.is_denied`) pre-execution | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no deny-listed command was driven on codex (the `rm` in `C5` reached a card rather than a pre-block, but `rm -f <file>` is not known to be on the list) |
| PreToolUse hooks blocking execution | PARTIAL | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no hook was installed during the sweep |
| PostToolUse / Stop / SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Error hooks | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above |
| SEL audit of every executed tool + effective risk | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED, with two blind spots | `C5`/`C10`/`C17` — hash-chained `tool_invocation` rows with `tool_kind` and `metadata.risk` for every executed tool plus `approved`/`denied` decisions. Blind spot 1: every permission/decision row is named **`unknown`** (`C5`, `C17`). Blind spot 2: a CLI-side refusal is invisible — `C9`'s `request_user_input` failure produced no row at all |
| Unattended mode (strip interactive tools + fail-fast approvals, T5) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | same blocker as AAP-1: this isolated home has no model provider, so a loop fails on provider resolution (`C16`) before any ACP worker turn |
| Dry-run replay (T9 observe mode) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no dashboard entry point to drive as-a-user |
| OS sandbox wrap of the agent process | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | sandbox mode left at its default; no confinement boundary probed |
| Isolated CLI config hardening (`GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE`) | WIRED (opt-in) | **DIVERGED** | there is NO equivalent for codex — not opt-in, absent | `GideonApps/codex-agent/provider.py` states the bundle deliberately applies no config isolation, and the measured consequences are `C12` (all 12 of the operator's MCP servers live in-session), `C4` (the operator's skills/plugins loaded — the CLI said so in its own warning), `C14` (31 descendant processes per session) and `C19` (7 conversation transcripts + 7 shell snapshots written into the operator's real `~/.codex`) |

### 4c. Tools — codex column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Filesystem/shell tools (cwd-confined + extra_tool_roots) | PARTIAL | **DIVERGED** — worse | PARTIAL, and NOT cwd-confined | `C4` — the CLI's `exec_command`/`apply_patch` run in `~/.gideon/workspace` regardless of the session's `workspace_dir`, and reached arbitrary absolute paths under `/private/tmp` freely (`C5`, `C17`) |
| Full native tool registry (knowledge/tasks/loops/inbox/memory/artifacts/workflows/subagents/web/schedule) | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED (§5 gap 1 predicted "likely absent") | **ABSENT** | `C4` — the CLI's 14 tools are all its own; `knowledge_search` NO, `task_create` NO, `notify` NO, no `gideon-core` MCP server |
| Tool disable prefs (PT3/UT4 per-tool + per-provider) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no tool-disable pref was set |
| Per-turn tool retrieval + progressive disclosure (`tool_search`/`tool_schema`) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `C4` — the CLI enumerated only its OWN tools, including its own `tool_search_tool`; no host-injected retrieval tools |
| Failure breaker (warn@3/block@5/circuit@30) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `C10` — six consecutive failing tool calls in one turn, zero warn/block/circuit output |
| Structural loop detection (no-progress/ping-pong) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `C10` — six identically-shaped failures, no steering injection or abort |
| Typed tool-result meta (content_type/raw_ref/truncated/recovery_hints/ok) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT (empty, not fabricated) | `C5` — every `tool_result` carries `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []` |
| Structured tool-input rendering (dict → schema-driven fields) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — and for codex the structured payload IS on the wire | `C5` — `input: null` on every frame while `input_preview` holds flattened text; `gateway.log` at DEBUG shows the wire frame carrying `content: [{type: "diff", oldText: None, newText: "HELLO\n", path: "…", _meta: {kind: "add"}}]` |
| File-change diff chips (write/edit before-after) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — with the raw material fully structured, not merely inferable | same DEBUG frame as above: codex-acp sends a real diff object per edit, and zero `diff`/`file_change`/`old_string`/`new_string` keys reach the frontend |
| AskUserQuestion card | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED (audit: fires only if the CLI exposes an identically-named tool) | **ABSENT** | `C9` — codex *has* a `request_user_input` tool, and it fails CLI-side ("unavailable in Default mode"); no card, no SEL row, `0 tool calls` counted |
| Subagents (`subagent_run` + completion inject-back) | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED | **ABSENT** — precondition holds | `C4` — no `subagent_run` tool. `C14` — the `session_pid_<pid>.txt` file the inject-back depends on IS written for codex sessions |
| MCP tools (external servers) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL — and the subset is the OPERATOR'S | `C12` — 12 servers, all from the operator's real `~/.codex/config.toml`; nothing from Gideon's `mcp.json` |
| Queue-steering mid-turn (#37) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — the message queues instead | `C10` — a mid-turn send returned `{"queued": true}` and ran as its own turn afterwards; no steering injection into the live turn |

### 4d. Learning / memory — codex column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Preference-facet capture (every turn) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `C13` — `activity_event` kind `learned`: "Learned: never more" (the same poor extraction as claude, from the same sentence shape) |
| Correction→lesson review | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `C13`, `C14` — "Learned: User correction to honor: …" plus a `per_turn|lesson` row in `learning.db staging` and two rows in `semantic_memory` (one superseding the facet) |
| Procedural-outcome capture (M5d tool-outcome drain) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `C14` — after turns of 6 and 3 tool calls, `memory_events` was empty; the only rows appeared after the **0-tool** correction turn, and the self-model row that did land records `"tools": []` |
| Skill-ladder review (4-tier, propose-only) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | needs a model provider, which this isolated home lacks |
| Memory consolidation on session end | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | same reason |
| Incognito/restricted no-write guarantees | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no incognito/restricted session was driven |

### 4e. Session / conversation mechanics — codex column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Variants / regenerate (‹n/N› switcher) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `C15` — the regenerated assistant message carries `variants` (2) and `variant_idx: 1` |
| Edit & resend, branch continuation (fork) | WIRED | CONFIRMED with a caveat | WIRED, but the branch loses the runtime | `C15` — the fork carries all 14 messages with `acp_provider: ""` |
| Queued messages (merge/pop + live bubbles) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED end-to-end | `C10` — `queue_push` (with `queue_id`) during the turn, then `queue_pop` → `chat_user_message` → the queued message ran as its own turn. (This closes one of AAP-1's residuals) |
| Empty-turn auto-retry | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no empty turn occurred across 17 turns; not forceable as-a-user |
| Auto-nudge re-arm (loops) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | loop-only; blocked by the missing model provider |
| Context-% accounting | PARTIAL (UNKNOWN which backends emit) | **DIVERGED** | the chip is EMITTED but always reports a fabricated `0%` | `C4`, `C5`, `C10` — a `context_usage` frame with `pct: 0.0` and `Turn complete: … context 0%` on **every** one of 17 turns, including turns carrying 15 KB of injected context |
| Compaction | WIRED (CLI-owned `/compact`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT via the host | `C8` — `/compact` errors `-32601`; nothing compacts |
| Slash commands (via `stream_command`) | WIRED (protocol `commands/execute`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT — no plain-prompt fallback | `C8` — byte-identical failure to claude's, from a different adapter and a different CLI: `_vendor.dev/commands/execute` is not a method either adapter implements, so this is a host-side defect, not one adapter's gap |
| Session resume across gateway restarts (`session/load`) | PARTIAL (falls to `session/new` + compressed history) | **DIVERGED** — worse | ABSENT, and the runtime silently changes | `C1` (the adapter advertises `loadSession`), `C16` — after a restart **every** session's `acp_provider`/`mode`/`workspace_dir`/`reasoning_effort` is cleared while the pinned `model` survives, `resume_sid=None` (no `session/load`), and the next turn resolves on the native axis |
| Warm pool / instant start | WIRED | CONFIRMED (pool present, cold on this run) | WIRED-but-cold | `gateway.log` — `pool_size=0 pool_qsize=0` on every `Pool decision`, and a fresh `Spawned codex-acp` per turn |
| Concurrent sessions on one process (P9) | ABSENT (dialect False) | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `C14` — three concurrently-bound codex sessions hold three DIFFERENT adapter PIDs |
| Pipe-death auto-retry / re-queue | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no adapter process was killed mid-turn |
| Model override per session (composer picker) | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | applied on the session's FIRST turn only | `C12` — `ACP model: openai.gpt-5.4` on turn 1; `C13` — `ACP model: auto (from agent config)` on turn 2 of the same session, while the activity line kept printing `openai.gpt-5.4`. The CLI cannot self-report its model, so honoring was never verifiable from its side |
| Reasoning effort per turn | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | the axis does not exist on codex, yet the host accepts a value | `C2` — discovery returns `supported_efforts: []`; `C12` — the bind still accepted, stored and echoed `reasoning_effort: "low"`, and the CLI reports its effort is "not exposed" |
| Agent/persona selection | ABSENT (no persona axis) | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — and no dead UI | `C2` — exactly one agent with `provider_agent: ""` |
| Discovered-agent ephemeral binding (chat picker → `POST …/acp-agent`) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED, and *ephemeral* is literal | `C3` (the bind round-trips), `C15`/`C16` (lost on a fork and on a restart) |
| Turn telemetry (event/tool counts, tokens, cost estimate) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED (counts), context-% fabricated | `C5`, `C10` — `Turn complete: 103 events, 3 tool calls, context 0%` |

### Mark counts (codex, the same 63 audit cells)

| mark | count |
|---|---|
| CONFIRMED (runtime matched the audit's prediction) | 33 |
| DIVERGED (runtime contradicted it) | 10 |
| NOT-EXERCISED (no runtime observation obtained; reasons below) | 20 |

All four of the audit's literal `UNKNOWN` cells are now definite for codex (full native registry → ABSENT,
AskUserQuestion → ABSENT, subagents → ABSENT, context-% → emitted-but-fabricated), as are the two the
plan called out for codex specifically (compaction → ABSENT, slash commands → ABSENT-and-erroring).

### Residual not-exercised cells (codex, and why)

1. **Needs a model provider in the isolated home** (4): unattended mode, auto-nudge re-arm,
   skill-ladder review, memory consolidation. A loop/cron run fails on
   `no model provider resolves for use case 'chat'|'background'` (`C16`) before any ACP worker
   turn, so a wedge/no-wedge verdict would measure the wrong thing.
2. **Needs a fixture that was not built** (10): knowledge @-mention, attachment/paste, @prompt
   expansion, agent-profile system prompt, per-agent approval floor, PreToolUse hooks, the other
   five hook kinds, tool-disable prefs, Lumon persona injection, incognito/restricted.
3. **Needs timing/failure injection that did not land** (2): empty-turn auto-retry, pipe-death
   auto-retry.
4. **No as-a-user entry point** (2): dry-run replay, OS sandbox confinement probe.
5. **Blocked by codex's refusal to disclose its own context** (1): cancelled-turn preamble
   re-injection — the cancel was performed (`C18`) but the re-injection could not be read back.
   This is why `G26` below is filed as a methodology gap.
6. **No deny-listed command was driven** (1): the hard deny-list cell.

### Gap inventory — severity-ranked (codex findings, continuing AAP-1's numbering)

**Cross-provider confirmations first.** Eleven of AAP-1's sixteen findings reproduce on codex with
a different adapter, a different CLI and a different vendor, which promotes them from
"claude-code behavior" to **host-side defects**: `G1` (cwd/home escape — `C4`), `G3` (no
`gideon-core` surface — `C4`), `G4` (slash commands error, no fallback — `C8`, byte-identical
error text), `G5` (a restart silently changes the runtime — `C16`, and here it clears *all*
sessions), `G6` (no host-side brake — `C10`), `G7` (no procedural capture — `C14`), `G8` (fabricated
`0%` — every turn), `G13` (a fork loses the binding — `C15`), `G14` (the activity line names the
adapter: `via acp:codex-acp` — `C4`), `G15` ("Session created" on every turn — `C5`), `G16` (the
identical `Learned: never more` extraction — `C13`). `G2` does **not** reproduce in the same shape;
it is worse, and is refiled as `G17`.

**P0 — safety**

- **`G17` codex has no config-isolation lever at all — `GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE` has no equivalent.**
  Where the claude bundle ships an opt-in hardening flag that `AAP-5` can promote to a default, the
  codex bundle applies none *by design* (`GideonApps/codex-agent/provider.py` docstring:
  "Codex manages its own configuration and auth, so this bundle does **not** apply the
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation the Claude bundle needs"). Measured consequences of that default:
  all **12** of the operator's own MCP servers are live inside every host-managed ACP session
  (`C12`) — including write-capable internal ones — the operator's skills/plugins load (`C4`), each
  session drags **31 descendant processes** (`C14`), and the CLI writes conversation transcripts of
  host-driven turns into the operator's real `~/.codex/sessions/` plus per-session shell snapshots
  (`C19`). So `AAP-5`'s "make the isolated config the default for host-managed sessions" has
  **nothing to flip** on codex: the mechanism must be built (codex reads `CODEX_HOME`), and until it
  is, every codex ACP session inherits an unbounded, operator-specific tool surface that the host
  neither declares nor gates. Owner: agent app bundle + core seam, `AAP-5`.

**P1 — capability-dead**

- **`G18` The approval card cannot name the tool it is approving on codex.** Every `approval` frame
  and every SEL decision row reads `tool: "unknown"` with `tool_kind: ""` (`C5`, `C17`), so the
  card shows only a raw payload and the audit trail records `unknown | approved`. Root cause is
  host-side and exact: `src/gideon/acp/translate.py:263` takes `title` from the
  `session/request_permission` frame's `toolCall`, and codex-acp's permission payload is only
  `{toolCallId, kind, status}` (`gateway.log` DEBUG: `Permission toolCall payload: {'toolCallId':
  …, 'kind': 'edit', 'status': 'pending'}`) — the human title lives on the *preceding* `tool_call`
  frame. The same function already correlates the *input* across those two frames via the
  `tool_call_inputs` cache, so the title and the `kind` (which **is** present on codex's permission
  payload) are one cache lookup away. This also **corrects AAP-1's `G10`**, which concluded the
  `kind` "lives on the `tool_call` frame, not the permission frame" — true for claude, false for
  codex. Not fixed here: `acp/translate.py` is shared by all three providers and sits outside this
  atom's fence. Owner: core seam, `AAP-8`.
- **`G19` A task-mode denial kills the whole codex turn; a host rejection does not.** When ask or
  plan mode denies a tool, the codex turn produces **no `tool_result`**, ends with the assistant
  message `*Conversation interrupted*`, and the model never receives a denial it could react to
  (`C6`, `C7`, `C17`) — nor does the user get claude's explanatory "(Ask mode — only read-only
  tools run…)" line. A *rejected approval card* on the same provider is graceful: the tool gets a
  `tool_result`, the model apologises and the turn completes (`C11`). So the automatic policy path
  is the destructive one, and on codex a plan-mode session cannot even answer a question if it
  decides to touch a tool first. Owner: core seam, `AAP-6`/`AAP-9`.
- **`G20` The per-session model pin silently stops applying after the first turn.** `ACP model:
  openai.gpt-5.4` on turn 1, `ACP model: auto (from agent config)` on turn 2 of the same session
  (`C12`, `C13`), while the activity line keeps printing the pinned id — the user is told a model
  that is no longer in force, with no restart required to reach that state. Same family as `G5`'s
  binding loss but reachable in normal use. Owner: core seam, `AAP-7`.

**P2 — fidelity**

- **`G21` The reasoning-effort axis is a no-op on codex and the host does not know it.** Discovery
  returns `supported_efforts: []` (`C2`), yet a bind with `reasoning_effort: "low"` is accepted,
  persisted and echoed back (`C12`). §2.6's "grey the pill on kiro" fix must key off
  `supported_efforts` and therefore covers codex too — otherwise the composer offers a control the
  provider cannot honor.
- **`G22` The host discards a fully structured diff that codex already sends.** Each edit's
  `session/update` carries `content: [{type: "diff", oldText, newText, path, _meta: {kind: "add"}}]`
  (`gateway.log` DEBUG, `C6`), and the frontend receives `input: null`, a flattened text
  `input_preview`, and zero diff keys. AAP-1's `G9` proposed inferring chips *by kind*; on codex no
  inference is needed — the before/after text is on the wire. Owner `AAP-8`; this raises §2.5's
  ceiling from "chip" to "real diff".
- **`G23` CLI/adapter notices are rendered to the user as assistant prose and persisted as
  messages.** Every fresh codex session's first assistant chunk is "Warning: Skill descriptions
  were shortened to fit the 2% skills context budget…" (`C4`, `C7`), stored in
  `sessions/*.jsonl` as an assistant message — so it also feeds compressed history and the
  auto-title prompt. Owner: core seam, `AAP-8`.
- **`G24` A stop during a tool execution surfaces as an error, not a cancellation.**
  `POST …/{s}/stop` returned `{"ok": true}` and emitted `stop_event` `state: stopping`; one second
  later the turn ended with `ACP prompt timed out` (`C18`) — the user asked to stop and was shown a
  timeout failure. Adjacent to the cancel-legibility work already on this branch. Owner: core seam.
- **`G25` `request_user_input` exists on codex but is CLI-refused, invisibly.** The tool is in the
  advertised list and returns "`request_user_input is unavailable in Default mode`"; the host counts
  `0 tool calls` and writes **no** SEL row (`C9`). Mirror of `G11` on a different mechanism, and the
  reason the AskUserQuestion cell is ABSENT rather than merely unreachable. Belongs in the §2.7
  parity doc as a per-provider residual.

**P3 — cosmetic / legibility / methodology**

- **`G26` Prompt-side context cells cannot be validated by self-report on codex.** It declines —
  "I can't provide hidden context or instructions" (`C18`) — which is why the task-mode framing,
  persona and cancelled-turn-preamble cells could not be closed the way AAP-1 closed them on
  claude. Validating those cells for codex (and probably kiro) needs a host-side way to dump the
  assembled prompt for one turn (a debug endpoint or a `--dump-context` flag), and Phase 1's
  "zero UNKNOWN" bar depends on it. Owner: whoever runs `AAP-3`; file as a harness need, not a
  product feature.

**Negative results worth keeping** (so nobody re-chases them): the read/safe auto-approve is **not**
spoofable by hiding a mutation behind a read — `cat X && rm Y` is classified `execute`/`destructive`
and gated (`C11`); session **trust does not** bypass task mode (`C17`); the adapter's descendant
tracking **does** reap the MCP fleet — after the gateway was killed, zero adapters and no orphaned
young MCP processes remained, and the ~120 `builder-mcp` processes on this machine are the
operator's own pre-existing baseline, not a leak from the sweep (`C14`, `C19`); and codex wrote
**nothing** into the real `~/.gideon` despite running with its cwd inside it (`C19`).

### Incidental bugs fixed in-session (codex)

**None.** The two host-side defects this sweep localised precisely — `G18` (the permission frame's
title/kind are discarded in `src/gideon/acp/translate.py:263`) and `G19` (a task-mode denial
returns no `tool_result`) — live in `acp/translate.py` and the chat-runner gate path, which are
shared by all three ACP providers and outside this atom's fence. Per the plan's own rule
("anything structural waits for Phase 2 so fixes land against the full three-provider picture")
they are filed at their measured severity with the exact line and wire evidence instead of being
half-fixed here.

## Phase 1 results — kiro-cli verified matrix (atom `AAP-3`)

**Swept:** 2026-08-17/18 · **Adapter:** none — `kiro-cli acp` speaks ACP natively (native binary, no
npm adapter, so no `npx`/durable-install step and no adapter version to pin) · **CLI:** `kiro-cli`
2.18.1 at `/Users/golani/.toolbox/bin/kiro-cli` · **Dialect:** the core `default` dialect (the
`kiro-cli-agent` bundle ships no protocol code — `provider.py` resolves the binary and nothing else)
· **Host:** this repo at AAP-2's tip (`aa2610dc`), isolated
`GIDEON_HOME=/private/tmp/aap3-wt/.dev-home`, gateway on `:10451`,
`GIDEON_AUTH_MODE=none`, `GIDEON_FIRST_PARTY_APPS_DIR` pointed at the apps clone,
`GIDEON_ACP_NO_PROVISION=1` (a no-op for a native binary, set for symmetry with `AAP-2`).

**Auth precondition — the plan's FIRST clause — verdict: FRESH. No cell below is `ENV`.** Checked
before any capability probe, three ways: (1) `~/.midway/cookie` mtime `2026-08-17 21:45 PDT`, i.e.
**32 minutes** old at sweep start (`date` → `22:17 PDT`) and far inside a Midway cookie's lifetime;
(2) `kiro-cli whoami` → `Logged in with IAM Identity Center (https://amzn.awsapps.com/start)`,
`golani@amazon.com`, profile `KiroProfile-us-east-1`; (3) a **live model call** —
`kiro-cli chat --no-interactive "Reply with exactly the word AUTHOK…"` returned `AUTHOK`
(`Credits: 0.19 • Time: 5s`). So every failure recorded below is a capability observation, not an
auth artefact. **Worth recording for the next sweep:** the on-disk
`~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json` carries `expiresAt: 2026-07-10T19:55:50Z` — **five weeks
expired** — beside a live `refreshToken`, and `whoami` still resolves. So *that file's expiry is not
a freshness signal*; a future sweep that reads it and concludes "stale" would mis-file working cells
as `ENV`. Only a live call settles it.

**Method.** Same shape as `AAP-1`/`AAP-2`: the `kiro-cli-agent` bundle was installed from the
first-party apps dir into the isolated home (`POST /api/apps`), registering the `acp:kiro-cli`
ProviderEntry; dashboard chat sessions were bound to it
(`POST /api/chat/sessions/{s}/acp-agent`) and driven through the audit §6 checklist over the same
HTTP/SSE + WebSocket surfaces the dashboard uses — `POST /api/chat` for the turn (SSE), a
`/api/ws` capture for the `tool_call`/`tool_result`, `approval`, `context_usage`, `queue_*` and
telemetry frames SSE does not carry, and the persisted state under the isolated home. Every mark
names the command or artifact that produced it. **Per the brief's `G1` warning, cwd was asserted
from `pwd` INSIDE the spawned CLI, never from a host-side `cwd=` log line** — and note this host's
log level never emitted the `cwd=`/`pool_cwd=` lines `AAP-2` read, so the in-CLI assertion was the
only available evidence anyway.

**Marks.** Same vocabulary as `AAP-1`/`AAP-2`: `CONFIRMED` — the runtime matches the audit's
predicted verdict. `DIVERGED` — it does not; the observed verdict replaces the predicted one.
`NOT-EXERCISED` — no runtime observation was obtained, with the reason stated; reading the code and
reasoning that a cell *should* work is explicitly **not** a mark.

### Observation ledger (kiro-cli)

Ledger ids are `K…` so they never collide with `AAP-1`'s `O…` or `AAP-2`'s `C…`.
`S1` = `chat-1-1787030505` (`workspace_dir` set to `…/.dev-home/scratch` **before** binding).

| id | what was run | what was observed |
|---|---|---|
| `K1` | `POST /api/apps` with the first-party `kiro-cli-agent` dir, then `GET /api/agent-providers` | `acp:kiro-cli` registered, `ready: true`, `state: ready`, `detail: "initialize OK (caps: auth, loadSession, mcpCapabilities, promptCapabilities, sessionCapabilities)"`. `loadSession` **is** advertised (as on claude and codex); unlike codex there is no `providers` cap and unlike claude no `_meta` cap. Install scan: `verdict: clean`, `tier: community`, `signature: unsigned` |
| `K2` | `GET /api/agent-providers/acp:kiro-cli/agents` | **27 agents** — a real persona axis (claude had one, codex had none). Only **3** are kiro's own built-ins (`kiro_default`, `kiro_planner`, `kiro_guide`); the other **24 are the operator's private AIM/MeshGideon/kirocrew fleet** (`amzn-builder`, `atlas`, `cr-review-agent`, `oe-report-agent`, `offer-health-agent`, `meshgideon*`, `kirocrew*`, `meetings-*`, `oncall-triage`, `stores-builder`, `code-review-sage-reviewer`, …), each carrying its AIM description verbatim. `models` = **21** live-discovered ids (`auto`, `claude-opus-5`, …, `agi-nova-beta-1m`), identical on all 27. **`supported_efforts` = `[]`** on all 27 (claude advertised five; codex also `[]`). **`permission_modes` = `[]`** — where claude and codex both returned the host-side list `default, acceptEdits, plan, dontAsk, bypassPermissions`, kiro returns **nothing**. `cached: true` |
| `K3` | `POST …/{S1}/workspace-dir {"/private/tmp/aap3-wt/.dev-home/scratch"}`, then `POST …/{S1}/acp-agent {provider:"acp:kiro-cli"}`, then `GET /api/chat/sessions` | both round-trip: `workspace_dir` = the scratch dir, `acp_provider: "acp:kiro-cli"`, `provider_agent: ""`, `model: ""`, `reasoning_effort: ""` |
| `K4` | S1 turn 1: "Run exactly one shell command: `pwd` … then list your available tool names verbatim, then YES/NO for `knowledge_search`, `task_create`, `notify`" | `pwd` → **`/Users/golani/.gideon/workspace`** — **the escape reproduces on the third provider**, with `workspace_dir` set to the scratch dir *before* binding. `knowledge_search` **NO**, `task_create` **NO**, `notify` **NO**; no `gideon-core` server. The tool list is **57 tools, and it is the operator's own MCP fleet flattened into the session** — including write-capable and financially consequential internal ones: `get_aws_creds`, `configure_aws_access`, `use_aws`, `submit_expense_report`, `create_expense_report`, `add_expense`, `delete_report`, `switch_delegate`, `list_delegates`, `upload_receipt` — beside kiro's own natives (`shell`, `read`, `write`, `glob`, `grep`, `subagent`, `knowledge`, `todo_list`, `goal`, `introspect`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `code`, `parallel`). Telemetry: `Injected 10,471 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)`, `Session created · default · auto · via acp:kiro-cli`, `Turn complete: 282 events, 1 tool calls, context 0%` with one `context_usage` frame `pct: 0.0` |
| `K5` | the `pwd` call's own frames, captured on `/api/ws` and resolved with `POST …/{S1}/approve {action:"approved"}` | **`pwd` raised an approval card** — `risk: "safe"`, `is_read_only: "1"`, and the turn **blocked** until approved (codex auto-resolved its reads and its six `cat` calls with no card). The reason is visible in the frames: kiro's adapter titles the call honestly, `"Running: pwd"`, so the host classifies it `kind: "execute"`; codex's adapter titles an `exec_command` `"Read file '…'"`, which the host classifies `kind: "read"` and auto-approves. **The `approval` frame here carries a real `tool` title and the real `tool_input`** (`{"command": "pwd", "__tool_use_purpose": …}`) — so `AAP-2`'s `G18` (`tool: "unknown"`) does **not** reproduce on kiro; the frame instead omits `tool_kind` entirely and blanks `tool_purpose` while the sibling `tool_call` frame carries both `kind: execute` and `purpose`. `tool_result` again carries `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []` |
| `K6` | the `gideon.json` unknown, both halves: (a) `ls $GIDEON_HOME/agents/` + read the file; (b) `kiro-cli agent list`; (c) the tool list from `K4` | **RESOLVED — the file is generated and is NOT honored.** (a) the host **does** write a complete, correct `agents/gideon.json` into the isolated home at startup — `name: "gideon"`, `tools`/`allowedTools` = `["@gideon-core"]`, `mcpServers.gideon-core` = `<venv>/gideon mcp-core`, plus a `prompt` file URL. Nothing about it is malformed. (b) `kiro-cli agent list` prints its own discovery roots verbatim — `Workspace: <cwd>/.kiro/agents` and `Global: ~/.kiro/agents` — and lists **24 agents, none named `gideon`** (the only "gideon" substring in the output is the workspace path of the shell that ran it). `$GIDEON_HOME/agents/` is neither root, so the file is never read. (c) hence `K4`'s three NOs. **Also found in that file:** its `hooks.postToolUse` command is `… >> ~/.gideon/audit.log` — a **literal tilde path to the REAL home**, not `$GIDEON_HOME`. So the file Phase 2 §2.1 Prong B plans to symlink into `~/.kiro/agents/` would, the moment it is honored, make every isolated-home ACP session append to the operator's real `~/.gideon/audit.log` |
| `K7` | the concurrent-sessions unknown: `PATCH /api/config/gideon {path:"agent.acp_concurrent_sessions", value:true}` (verified `true` in `config.json`), then S2 + S3 both bound to `acp:kiro-cli` and **both driven at once** (two overlapping `POST /api/chat` counting turns), then `pgrep -f 'toolbox/bin/kiro-cli acp'` mid-flight and after | **DIVERGED — no process is shared.** The gate is genuinely ON (an in-process check under the same home returns `flag=True`, `get_dialect('default').supports_concurrent_sessions=True`, `concurrent_sessions_enabled('default')=True`), and `AcpPool._shared_connection` keys its cached connection on `runtime_id` alone — yet three bound sessions ran on **three distinct `kiro-cli acp` process trees** (`2883` for S1, `17853` for S2, `19208`→ later `19719` for S3, all children of the gateway PID). The plan's step 12 prediction — "two kiro chats, one PID serving both" — does not hold. Each tree is a 5-process stack (`kiro-cli acp` → `aim sandbox --client kiro-cli acp` → the AIM `sandbox/launcher` → the app-bundle `kiro-cli acp` → `kiro-cli-chat acp`), so the cost of not sharing is 5 processes per chat, not 1 |
| `K8` | S2 turn 2 (`"Reply with exactly: SEQ2"`) immediately after `K7`, then re-count the trees | **the process IS reused across a session's own turns** — no new tree appeared (`2883 17853 19719` before and after) and the reply came back on the existing one. This **differs from codex**, where `AAP-2` measured a new adapter process on *every* turn. So kiro pools per session; it just never pools *across* sessions |
| `K9` | `ls $GIDEON_HOME/session_pid_*.txt` with three sessions live and three CLI trees running | **only ONE pid file exists** — `session_pid_2883.txt` → `dashboard:chat-1-1787030505` (S1). S2 and S3 have live processes and no pid file at all, where `AAP-2` measured one file per session on codex (three sessions → three files). §2.1's acceptance criterion names this file as the mechanism subagent inject-back resolves through ("correct session inject-back via the `session_pid_<pid>.txt` + env resolution"), so that precondition holds for S1 and is **absent** for the other two — and nothing in the UI distinguishes them |
| `K10` | the effort/model/persona axes: S2 and S3 were bound with `{provider_agent:"kiro_default", model:"claude-haiku-4.5", reasoning_effort:"low"}` against a provider whose `supported_efforts` is `[]` (`K2`) | the bind returned `{"ok": true, …, "reasoning_effort": "low"}` — **the host accepts and persists an effort value for a provider that advertises none, silently**. Nothing rejects it, nothing warns, and the session then runs normally. So on kiro the effort pill is a **silent no-op that round-trips**, which is the precise failure Success Criterion 7 forbids ("greyed, not no-op"); `supported_efforts: []` is already on the wire in the discovered-agent payload, so the UI has what it needs to grey the control and does not use it. The `model` half **does** take effect: both sessions answered on the pinned model and the activity line read `Session created · default · auto · via acp:kiro-cli` |
| `K11` | S2: sent the literal message `/compact` | **identical failure to claude and codex** — `Prompt error: {'code': -32601, 'message': 'Method not found', 'data': '_vendor.dev/commands/execute'}`, no plain-prompt fallback, no compaction. So `G4` now holds on **all three providers** and is settled as a host bug. One difference worth the fix's attention: kiro returns a *well-formed* JSON-RPC error object with the method in `data`, where the Zed adapters fold it into the `message` string — so the host has a machine-readable "method not supported" to key a fallback off, on at least one provider. SEL audited it: `operation: slash_command`, `tool_kind: slash`, `outcome: bypass`, `metadata.command: "/compact"` |
| `K12` | S1, task mode `agent`: "read `…/scratch/probe.txt`, create `…/scratch/written.txt` = `HELLO`, `rm …/scratch/doomed.txt`", `/api/ws` captured, every card resolved `approved` by a poller | all three ran and the state changed as asked (`written.txt` created, `doomed.txt` gone). **Every one of the three raised a card — including the READ.** codex auto-approved its reads; kiro does not, because kiro's adapter titles calls honestly (`Reading probe.txt:1`, `Running: pwd`) and the host's classifier lands them `read`/`execute` without the effective-safe auto-approve firing. The **edit card's `tool_input` is a real unified diff** (`--- … +++ … @@ -0,0 +1 @@ +HELLO`), so §2.5's diff chip has its source on kiro as well as codex. The `rm` card's input additionally carries `working_dir: "…/.dev-home/scratch"` — the correct dir, on a session whose `pwd` is the escaped real home (`K4`), so the two disagree inside one turn. **`AAP-2`'s `G18` does NOT reproduce:** kiro's cards carry the real tool title everywhere — `approval` frame, `pending_approval_info` and SEL all name the tool — never `unknown` |
| `K13` | the same turn's eight `tool_call` frames vs its `approval` frames vs its SEL rows | **`AAP-1`'s `G2` (contingent gate coverage) is now MEASURED, not hypothetical.** kiro's native `todo_list` tool fired four times in that turn — `Creating task list: …`, `Completing #1`, `#2`, `#3` — each producing a `tool_call` frame and a SEL `invoked` row, and **not one of them produced an `approval` frame, an `approval_resolved`, or any decision row**. They simply executed. The host classified each of those four `tool_kind: "unknown"` with **`risk: "destructive"`** — so four tool calls the host itself labelled destructive ran with **no gate at all**, in the same turn where three others were gated. `AAP-2` concluded "across the whole sweep no ACP tool executed without passing the host gate"; on kiro that is false, because the host can only gate what the CLI *chooses* to ask about and kiro's todo tool never asks. Separately, the read's two SEL rows **disagree with each other**: `invoked` says `risk: safe`, the matching `approved` says `risk: caution` |
| `K14` | S3 with `POST /api/chat/task-mode {mode:"ask"}` set before the turn, then "use your write tool to create `…/scratch/ask-mode-probe.txt`" | **the write was blocked and the file never appeared** — and kiro handles it far better than codex did. The user is told why, inline, in the tool line itself: `Creating ask-mode-probe.txt (Ask mode — only read-only tools run (switch to Agent to make changes))`. The turn then **ended normally** (`[DONE]`, `Turn complete: 9 events, 1 tool calls`), where the identical denial on codex produced no `tool_result` and killed the turn with `*Conversation interrupted*`. SEL logged `Creating ask-mode-probe.txt | denied | {"reason": "task_mode:ask"}` with the real operation name, where codex logged `unknown`. So **`AAP-2`'s `G19` is codex-specific, not a host defect** — the shared gate path can and does return a legible denial, which makes `G19` a smaller, better-bounded fix than it looked with one provider |
| `K15` | S1: six `cat /nonexistent-aap3-probe-N` commands as one tool call each, "do NOT stop early"; the FIRST card resolved with `{action:"trust"}`; 30 s in, a second `POST /api/chat` sent while the turn ran | **trust works, the brake does not, the queue does.** After the one `trust` resolution, probes 2-6 each surfaced a `tool_call` with `"auto": true` and **no card** — session trust is live on kiro. All six commands ran and failed → **no warn, no block, no circuit abort, no steering injection** (`Turn complete: 196 events, 13 tool calls, context 0%`), so `G6` reproduces on the third provider. The mid-turn message returned `{"ok": true, "queued": true}`, emitted `queue_push` with a `queue_id`, and after the turn a `queue_pop` + `chat_user_message` ran it as its own turn (`Turn complete: 9 events, 0 tool calls`) — queueing drains end-to-end, as on codex. The 13 calls break down as 1 task-list + 6 `cat` + 6 `Completing #N`, i.e. **7 of 13 were the ungated todo tool of `K13`** |
| `K16` | S2 turn: a correction ("No - stop doing that. Always answer me in exactly one sentence from now on, never more.") | two `learned` activity events: **`Learned: never more`** and `Learned: User correction to honor: …` — the identical bad extraction `AAP-1` and `AAP-2` measured, byte-for-byte. `G16` now holds on all three |
| `K17` | `sqlite3 memory.db`/`learning.db` after turns carrying 13, 8 and 3 tool calls | `memory_events` has **4 rows and every one of them is from the 0-tool correction turn** (`facet_veto` + `after_turn_review` lesson rows, then a `user.selfmodel.pending…` row whose payload is `{"pattern": "Gideon + no-tools", "route": "Gideon", "tools": [], "succeeded": true}`). The tool-heavy turns produced **zero** procedural rows, and the self-model row asserts `tools: []` for a session that had just made 13 tool calls. `G7` now holds on all three |
| `K18` | `POST …/{S1}/fork` | the fork (`chat-4-…`) carries `acp_provider: ""` — **the branch loses the runtime**, as on codex, so `G13` holds on all three. It *does* inherit `workspace_dir`. Separately: the fork reports `messages: 8` from a parent with **42** — codex's fork carried all of its parent's messages, so what a fork copies differs by more than the binding (mechanism not established; recorded as measured) |
| `K19` | killed the gateway with three sessions live and three CLI trees running, then `pgrep -f 'toolbox/bin/kiro-cli acp'` | **all three trees were reaped — zero leaked processes.** kiro's 5-deep stack (`kiro-cli` → `aim sandbox` → AIM `launcher` → app-bundle `kiro-cli` → `kiro-cli-chat`) goes away with the gateway, so `AAP-1`'s two-orphan leak does not reproduce here |
| `K20` | restarted the gateway with the same env, then inspected every session, then sent one turn | **all four sessions came back with `acp_provider: null`, `reasoning_effort: null`, `workspace_dir: null`, `mode: null` and (this sweep's addition) `task_mode: null`**, while `model` survived — the same shape `AAP-2` measured, so `G5` holds on all three. The turn then resolved on the **native** axis and errored `no model provider resolves for use case 'chat'`. No `session/load` was attempted despite `loadSession` being advertised at `initialize` (`K1`) |
| `K21` | after that restart: `POST …/{s}/acp-agent` on each of the three pre-restart sessions, and on a brand-new one | the new session bound fine; **all three pre-restart sessions returned `{"error": "not found"}`** — even though `GET /api/chat/sessions` lists them. They become re-bindable only after a `POST /api/chat` touches them, and that touch is exactly the call that hard-errors (`K20`). So the restart's repair path is: send a message, receive an unexplained provider error, *then* re-bind — nothing surfaces that sequence. (This is why `AAP-2` was able to "re-bind S1": it had already sent a turn on it.) |
| `K22` | S5 = a FRESH session, `task_mode=plan` set **before** its first turn, then "state your approval mode, then use your write tool to create `…/scratch/plan-mode-probe.txt`" | **CONFIRMED, exactly as the audit predicted for kiro:** no native plan mode — the CLI called its write tool — and the host gate blocked it (`Creating plan-mode-probe.txt (Plan mode — inspection only, nothing is executed (switch to Agent to run it))`), file never created. The reply also carried the host's own `[SWITCH_TO_AGENT: …]` marker (a real host convention — `dashboard/chat_utils.py:107-115` instructs it, `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx:3495` strips it), so kiro honours the plan-mode instruction protocol end to end |
| `K23` | S5: `POST /api/chat/task-mode {mode:"agent"}` (verified `task_mode: agent` on `GET /api/chat/sessions`), then two further turns asking for a shell command, then "quote verbatim every context line containing 'Task mode'" | **P1 — the session is wedged in plan mode.** Both post-switch turns refused ("I'm in PLAN mode and cannot execute commands"), and the context dump proves it is not the model replaying its own refusals: the injected block literally reads **`## Task mode: Plan`**, on a session the API reports as `agent`. Worse, that same block asserts *"This posture is current as of THIS turn and supersedes any mode an earlier turn in this conversation mentioned — if a previous reply refused because it was in a different mode, re-evaluate against the mode stated here and don't carry that refusal forward"* — so the host tells the model to trust a value the host is shipping stale, which is precisely why no amount of re-asking recovers. Note the host *gate* was correctly on `agent` the whole time, so the user is blocked by a stale prompt rather than by policy |
| `K24` | the control for `K23`: the same session key after a gateway restart (fresh CLI process), `task_mode` set to `agent`, then "quote the line starting `## Task mode:`" | `"## Task mode: Agent\nYou are in AGENT mode -- full execution…"` — **correct.** So the framing is assembled correctly per turn *when the process is new*, and `K23`'s staleness is caused by kiro's per-session process **reuse** (`K8`): the task-mode block is fixed when the CLI process/session is created and never refreshed for its later turns. This is the one place where kiro's efficiency advantage over codex (which respawns every turn, `AAP-2`) is what creates the defect — claude and codex cannot show this bug because they never reuse a process |
| `K25` | S2: "run exactly `git -C /nonexistent-aap3-repo push origin main`" (a path chosen so that execution, if it happened, could only fail harmlessly) | **the hard deny-list DOES cover ACP tools — better than the audit predicted (ABSENT).** The call was blocked pre-execution and the reason was surfaced to the user in the tool line: `Running: git -C … push origin main (blocked: Blocked by security policy: *git*push*)`, matching `BUILTIN_DENY_PATTERNS`' `*git*push*` against the adapter's *title*. SEL logged `invoked` then `denied`. One asymmetry: the `denied` row's `metadata` is **empty `{}`** — the pattern that the UI names is absent from the audit trail |
| `K26` | `request_user_input`/AskUserQuestion reachability, from `K4`'s verbatim tool list | **ABSENT** — kiro exposes no `request_user_input`-style tool at all (codex had one that then failed CLI-side). kiro does ship its own `subagent`, `knowledge`, `todo_list` and `goal` natives, none of which are Gideon's, so the platform's `subagent_run` inject-back has no reachable entry point here either |

### 4a. Prompt-side context — kiro-cli column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory recall injection (turn-0 context) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `K4`, `K22` — `Injected 10,471 / 7,283 / 6,971 / 4,868 chars of context (memory, lessons, history, episodic)` on each fresh session |
| Knowledge context (@-mention + picker `meta.knowledge`) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no `meta` payload was sent; the injector was never driven |
| Attachments/paste (extracted text prepended) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above |
| @prompt expansion (+ typed vars, snippets) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above |
| Skills index in context + `skill_invoke`/`skill_search` execution | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `K4` — neither `skill_invoke` nor `skill_search` appears in the CLI's 57-tool list. The index half was **not** exercised: unlike the codex sweep, no prompt in this one matched a skill, so `gateway.log` carries no `Surfaced skills:` line and SEL has no `skill_surface` row at all |
| Session-live skill drafts (`skill_remember`) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | `K4` — absent from the tool list |
| Task-mode framing (Agent/Ask/Plan/Build suffix) | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | the block IS injected and its VALUE goes stale on a reused process | `K23` — the framing quoted verbatim reads `## Task mode: Plan` on a session the API reports as `task_mode: agent`; `K24` — the same session on a fresh process reads `## Task mode: Agent`. This is the cell `AAP-2` could not close on codex (`G26`); kiro closes it and it is broken |
| Agent profile system prompt / voice layer | PARTIAL | NOT-EXERCISED | — | a kiro **persona** was bound (`kiro_default`), but no Gideon agent profile carrying a distinctive `system_prompt` |
| Project binding (context preamble + cwd) | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | the cwd half does not work | `K4` — `workspace_dir` set to the scratch dir **before** binding, and `pwd` inside the spawned CLI answered `/Users/golani/.gideon/workspace`. The preamble half was not separately measured. `K12` shows the same turn's `rm` call carrying the *correct* `working_dir`, so the two disagree inside one turn |
| project_id → artifact stamping | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT (stronger) | `K4` — `artifact_save` is not reachable at all, so there is nothing to stamp |
| Persona injection (Lumon theme) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | the persona toggle was never enabled |
| Cancelled-turn preamble re-injection | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | attempted twice (`K21`, `K22`): both stop attempts landed on turns the plan-mode wedge (`G29`) had already made tool-free, so no tool was ever interrupted and there was no cancellation to re-inject after |
| Compressed thread-history bootstrap (new process) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | continuity held across 42 messages / many turns on S1, and after the restart a **fresh** process on a 12-message session still answered in context with a fresh `Injected …` line (`K24`). Note the mechanism differs from the Zed adapters: kiro reuses one process per session (`K8`), so most turns need no re-bootstrap at all |

### 4b. Approvals / permissions / safety — kiro-cli column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interactive approval cards | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `K5` (a card raised, resolved, the tool then ran), `K12` (three cards in one turn, all resolvable) |
| trust_reads (effective-safe auto-approve) | PARTIAL | **DIVERGED** | it does not fire on kiro at all — reads are carded | `K5` — `pwd` arrived `risk: "safe"`, `is_read_only: "1"` and **still blocked on a card**; `K12` — a plain file read did too. The auto-approve is title-driven, and kiro's honest `Running: pwd` / `Reading probe.txt:1` titles land as `execute`/`read` without triggering it, where codex's mislabelled `Read file '…'` title for a shell `exec_command` did |
| Trust (session) / YOLO (global) auto-approve | WIRED | CONFIRMED (session trust) | WIRED for session trust; YOLO not exercised | `K15` — one `{action:"trust"}` and the next five tool calls surfaced `"auto": true` with no card; `trust: true` persists on the session |
| Per-agent approval floor ("Always allow") | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no agent profile with `approval_mode: auto` was bound |
| Task-mode enforcement BEFORE approval (trust can't bypass) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `K14` (ask-mode write denied, file never created, SEL `denied | task_mode:ask`), `K22` (plan-mode write denied). The *trust-can't-bypass* half was established on codex (`C17`) and not separately re-driven here, because kiro's trust and its ask-mode probes ran on different sessions |
| Plan mode → native backend plan | WIRED | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — enforced only by the host gate, exactly as the audit predicted **for kiro** | `K22` — plan set before a fresh session's first turn; the CLI called its write tool anyway, the host blocked it, and the reply carried the host's `[SWITCH_TO_AGENT: …]` marker |
| Hard deny-list (`security.is_denied`) pre-execution | ABSENT | **DIVERGED** | WIRED — it covers ACP tools | `K25` — `git … push` was blocked pre-execution with the pattern named to the user (`blocked: Blocked by security policy: *git*push*`) and a SEL `denied` row. The first positive result for this cell across all three sweeps |
| PreToolUse hooks blocking execution | PARTIAL | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no hook was installed during the sweep |
| PostToolUse / Stop / SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Error hooks | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | as above. Note `K6` found the generated `gideon.json` *declares* a `postToolUse` hook, but that file is never read (`G31`) |
| SEL audit of every executed tool + effective risk | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED — and better named than on codex, with one internal contradiction | `K12`, `K13`, `K15` — hash-chained `tool_invocation` rows for **every** executed tool including the ungated ones, each carrying the real operation title (`AAP-2`'s "every row is named `unknown`" blind spot does **not** reproduce). The contradiction: one read produced `invoked | risk: safe` and `approved | risk: caution` for the same call |
| Unattended mode (strip interactive tools + fail-fast approvals, T5) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | same blocker as both prior sweeps: this isolated home has no model provider, so a loop fails on `no model provider resolves for use case 'background'` before any ACP worker turn |
| Dry-run replay (T9 observe mode) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no dashboard entry point to drive as-a-user |
| OS sandbox wrap of the agent process | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | the host's sandbox mode was left at its default and no confinement boundary was probed. (kiro brings its *own* `aim sandbox` layer — visible in every process tree, `K7` — which is not the host's mechanism) |
| Isolated CLI config hardening (`GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE`) | WIRED (opt-in) | **DIVERGED** | there is NO equivalent for kiro either — and its leak is an identity leak, not only a tool leak | `K2` (24 of 27 offered personas are the operator's private AIM/MeshGideon/kirocrew agents), `K4` (57 tools, all the operator's, including `get_aws_creds`, `use_aws`, `configure_aws_access` and the Concur expense-write set), `K7` (5 processes per session) |

### 4c. Tools — kiro-cli column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Filesystem/shell tools (cwd-confined + extra_tool_roots) | PARTIAL | **DIVERGED** — worse | PARTIAL, and NOT cwd-confined | `K4` — the CLI's own `shell`/`read`/`write` work, but its cwd is the real `~/.gideon/workspace`, not the session's `workspace_dir` |
| Full native tool registry (knowledge/tasks/loops/inbox/memory/artifacts/workflows/subagents/web/schedule) | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `K4` — `knowledge_search`/`task_create`/`notify` all NO, no `gideon-core` server; `K6` — the config that would provide it is never read |
| Tool disable prefs (PT3/UT4 per-tool + per-provider) | ABSENT | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no tool-disable pref was set |
| Per-turn tool retrieval + progressive disclosure (`tool_search`/`tool_schema`) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `K4` — all 57 tools were enumerated up front; kiro ships no `tool_search`-style tool (codex did) |
| Failure breaker (warn@3/block@5/circuit@30) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `K15` — six consecutive failing tool calls in one turn, zero warn/block/abort |
| Structural loop detection (no-progress/ping-pong) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `K15` — six identically-shaped failures, no steering injection |
| Typed tool-result meta (content_type/raw_ref/truncated/recovery_hints/ok) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT (empty, not fabricated) | `K5`, `K12` — every `tool_result` carries `content_type: ""`, `raw_ref: ""`, `truncated: false`, `original_length: null`, `recovery_hints: []` |
| Structured tool-input rendering (dict → schema-driven fields) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — and the structured payload IS on the wire | `K12` — `input_preview` carries real JSON (`command`, `working_dir`, `operations[].mode/path`, `__tool_use_purpose`) while `input` is `null`, so the host has the fields and drops them |
| File-change diff chips (write/edit before-after) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — with the raw material already present | `K12` — the edit card's payload is a **unified diff** (`--- … +++ … @@ -0,0 +1 @@ +HELLO`), rendered as prose |
| AskUserQuestion card | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED | **ABSENT** | `K26` — kiro exposes no `request_user_input`-style tool at all (codex had one that failed CLI-side) |
| Subagents (`subagent_run` + completion inject-back) | UNKNOWN | CONFIRMED | **ABSENT**, and the precondition is patchy | `K4`/`K26` — no `subagent_run`; kiro's own native `subagent` is not the platform's. `K9` — the `session_pid_<pid>.txt` inject-back precondition existed for only 1 of 3 live sessions |
| MCP tools (external servers) | PARTIAL | CONFIRMED | PARTIAL — and the subset is the OPERATOR'S entire fleet | `K4` — 57 tools, none from Gideon, all from the operator's real `~/.kiro` MCP configuration |
| Queue-steering mid-turn (#37) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT — the message queues instead | `K15` — a mid-turn send returned `{"queued": true}`, ran after the turn, and injected nothing into the running one |

### 4d. Learning / memory — kiro-cli column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Preference-facet capture (every turn) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `K16` — `activity_event` kind `learned`: `Learned: never more` (the same bad extraction as on both other providers) |
| Correction→lesson review | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED | `K16`, `K17` — `Learned: User correction to honor: …` plus `facet_veto` + `after_turn_review` rows in `memory.db` |
| Procedural-outcome capture (M5d tool-outcome drain) | ABSENT | CONFIRMED | ABSENT | `K17` — after turns of 13, 8 and 3 tool calls, every `memory_events` row came from the **0-tool** correction turn, and the self-model row asserts `tools: []` |
| Skill-ladder review (4-tier, propose-only) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | needs a model provider, which this isolated home lacks |
| Memory consolidation on session end | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | same reason |
| Incognito/restricted no-write guarantees | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no incognito/restricted session was driven |

### 4e. Session / conversation mechanics — kiro-cli column

| Feature | audit said | mark | runtime verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Variants / regenerate (‹n/N› switcher) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | not driven; `AAP-2` closed it on codex and re-driving it here would have bought a duplicate observation for one more paid turn |
| Edit & resend, branch continuation (fork) | WIRED | CONFIRMED with a caveat | WIRED, but the branch loses the runtime | `K18` — the fork carries `acp_provider: ""` and inherits `workspace_dir`; it also copied 8 of the parent's 42 messages, where codex's fork copied all of its parent's |
| Queued messages (merge/pop + live bubbles) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED end-to-end | `K15` — `queue_push` with a `queue_id` during the turn, then `queue_pop` + `chat_user_message` + its own `Turn complete` after it |
| Empty-turn auto-retry | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no empty turn occurred; not forceable as-a-user |
| Auto-nudge re-arm (loops) | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | loop-only; blocked by the missing model provider |
| Context-% accounting | PARTIAL (UNKNOWN which backends emit) | **DIVERGED** | the chip is EMITTED but always reports a fabricated `0%` | `K4`, `K12`, `K15` — `context_usage {pct: 0.0}` and `context 0%` on every turn, including one carrying 13 tool calls and 196 events |
| Compaction | WIRED (CLI-owned `/compact`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT via the host | `K11` — `/compact` errors `-32601`; nothing compacts |
| Slash commands (via `stream_command`) | WIRED (protocol `commands/execute`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT — no plain-prompt fallback | `K11` — the same `_vendor.dev/commands/execute` failure as claude and codex, though kiro returns it as a well-formed error with the method in `data` |
| Session resume across gateway restarts (`session/load`) | PARTIAL (falls to `session/new` + compressed history) | **DIVERGED** — worse | ABSENT, and unrecoverable without an undocumented sequence | `K20` — every session returns with `acp_provider: null` (+ effort, workspace_dir, mode and task_mode null) and the next turn errors on the native axis, with no `session/load` attempted despite `loadSession` advertised; `K21` — re-binding then 404s until a `POST /api/chat` touches the session |
| Warm pool / instant start | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED, and demonstrably warm | `K8` — a second turn on the same session reused the live process (`pgrep` identical before and after) and answered immediately. The first runtime demonstration of a warm reuse across the three sweeps; codex was cold on every turn |
| Concurrent sessions on one process (P9) | WIRED for this dialect (`supports_concurrent_sessions = True`) | **DIVERGED** | ABSENT — nothing is shared | `K7` — flag on, gate returns `True`, `_shared_connection` keys on `runtime_id` alone, and three bound sessions still ran on three separate 5-process trees |
| Pipe-death auto-retry / re-queue | WIRED | NOT-EXERCISED | — | no CLI process was killed mid-turn |
| Model override per session (composer picker) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED, and legible | `K10` — the bind echoed `claude-haiku-4.5`, the activity line named it (`Session created · kiro_default · claude-haiku-4.5 · via acp:kiro-cli`) and both sessions answered on it. codex's `G20` (the pin lapsing after turn 1) could **not** be re-tested here: kiro does not self-report its model id, so per-turn re-application is unobservable from the CLI side |
| Reasoning effort per turn | WIRED | **DIVERGED** | the axis does not exist on kiro, yet the host accepts, persists and echoes a value | `K2` — `supported_efforts: []` on all 27 agents; `K10` — a bind with `reasoning_effort: "low"` returns `{"ok": true, …, "reasoning_effort": "low"}`. This is `AAP-2`'s `G21` measured on the provider §2.6 named it for |
| Agent/persona selection | WIRED (kiro has agents) | CONFIRMED | WIRED — and the axis is populated from the operator's private fleet | `K2` — 27 agents, only 3 of them kiro's built-ins; `K10` — binding `kiro_default` round-trips and the activity line names it |

| Turn telemetry (event/tool counts, tokens, cost estimate) | WIRED | CONFIRMED | WIRED (counts), context-% fabricated | `K4`, `K15` — `Turn complete: 282 events, 1 tool calls, context 0%` / `196 events, 13 tool calls, context 0%` |

### Mark counts (kiro-cli, the same 63 audit cells)

| mark | count |
|---|---|
| CONFIRMED (runtime matched the audit's prediction) | 31 |
| DIVERGED (runtime contradicted it) | 12 |
| NOT-EXERCISED (no runtime observation obtained; reasons below) | 20 |

All four of the audit's literal `UNKNOWN` cells are now definite for kiro (full native registry →
ABSENT, AskUserQuestion → ABSENT, subagents → ABSENT, context-% → emitted-but-fabricated), as are
the two the plan flagged for kiro specifically (compaction → ABSENT, slash commands →
ABSENT-and-erroring) **and the three unknowns this atom was scoped to close**:
`gideon.json` discovery → **NOT honored** (`K6`), the effort pill → **a silent no-op that
round-trips** (`K10`), concurrent sessions → **declared and absent** (`K7`).

### Residual not-exercised cells (kiro-cli, and why)

1. **Needs a model provider in the isolated home** (4): unattended mode, auto-nudge re-arm,
   skill-ladder review, memory consolidation. Identical blocker to both prior sweeps —
   `no model provider resolves for use case 'chat'|'background'` (`K20`). Three sweeps have now
   paid this cost; seeding one cheap provider into the sweep home is the obvious `AAP-4` fixture.
2. **Needs a fixture that was not built** (10): knowledge @-mention, attachment/paste, @prompt
   expansion, agent-profile system prompt, per-agent approval floor, PreToolUse hooks, the other
   five hook kinds, tool-disable prefs, Lumon persona injection, incognito/restricted.
3. **Needs timing/failure injection that did not land** (2): empty-turn auto-retry, pipe-death
   auto-retry.
4. **No as-a-user entry point** (2): dry-run replay, OS sandbox confinement probe.
5. **Blocked by another finding in this sweep** (1): cancelled-turn preamble re-injection — both
   stop attempts (`K21`, `K22`) hit turns that `G29`'s plan-mode wedge had already made tool-free,
   so nothing was interrupted. This one is *unblocked by fixing `G29`*, not by new fixtures.
6. **Deliberately not re-driven** (1): variants/regenerate — closed on codex, and one more paid
   turn here would only have duplicated it.

### Gap inventory — severity-ranked (kiro-cli findings, continuing `AAP-2`'s numbering)

**Cross-provider confirmations first.** Ten of `AAP-1`'s sixteen findings reproduce on a provider
with **no adapter at all** (kiro speaks ACP natively), a third vendor and a third auth model, which
settles them as **host-side defects** rather than adapter or CLI behavior: `G1` (cwd/home escape —
`K4`), `G3` (no `gideon-core` surface — `K4`, `K6`), `G4` (slash commands error with no
fallback — `K11`, and now on a provider that reports the failure as a *structured* JSON-RPC error,
so a fallback is keyable), `G5` (a restart silently changes the runtime — `K20`, and here it also
clears `task_mode`), `G6` (no host-side brake — `K15`), `G7` (no procedural capture — `K17`), `G8`
(fabricated `0%` — every turn), `G13` (a fork loses the binding — `K18`), `G15` ("Session created"
on every turn — `K8` plus the per-session counts, and on kiro the line is not merely noisy but
**false**: S1 claimed it four times on a process that was created once), `G16` (the identical
`Learned: never more` extraction — `K16`). `AAP-2`'s `G17` (no config-isolation lever) also
reproduces, in a distinct and worse shape filed below as `G28`.

**Three of the prior sweeps' findings do NOT reproduce, which narrows their fixes:** `G18` (the
permission frame's title/kind discarded — kiro's cards, `pending_approval_info` and SEL rows all
carry the real tool title, never `unknown`); `G19` (a task-mode denial killing the turn — on kiro
the denial is graceful, legible and the turn completes normally, `K14`, so `G19` is
codex-specific); and `G26` (a provider that will not quote its own context — kiro quotes it
verbatim, `K23`, which is precisely how this sweep proved `G29`). `G14` is not a defect here: the
activity line's `via acp:kiro-cli` names the provider, and for kiro that *is* the CLI. And `G2`
(contingent gate coverage) does more than reproduce — it is finally **measured**, as `G27`.

**P0 — safety**

- **`G27` The host approval gate is provably not universal: seven of thirteen tool calls in one
  turn executed with no permission request, and the host itself labelled each of them
  `risk: "destructive"`.** kiro's native `todo_list` tool (`Creating task list: …`,
  `Completing #1/#2/#3`) produces a `tool_call` frame and a SEL `invoked` row and **never** a
  `session/request_permission`, so nothing gates it — in the same turns where the read, the write
  and the `rm` each raised a card (`K13`, `K15`). `AAP-1` filed `G2` as a *contingent* risk and
  `AAP-2` concluded "across the whole sweep no ACP tool executed without passing the host gate";
  on kiro that conclusion is false. The severity is structural rather than about `todo_list`
  specifically: host safety on ACP is opt-in **by the CLI**, so every provider's ungated tool set
  is whatever that CLI chooses not to ask about, and the host cannot enumerate it. Combined with
  `G28`'s tool surface, the ungated set on this machine is drawn from the operator's own MCP fleet.
  Success Criterion 3's "never silently executed" is not met. Owner: core seam — and it needs a
  *positive* mechanism (deny-by-default for un-permissioned `tool_call`s, or an explicit
  per-provider enumeration of the not-gateable set) rather than another gate on the asking path.
- **`G28` kiro has no config-isolation lever either, and its leak is an identity leak on top of a
  tool leak.** Like codex (`G17`) the bundle applies no config isolation — but where codex leaked
  the operator's 12 MCP servers, kiro leaks (a) **24 of the 27 personas the host offers in its
  agent picker**, which are the operator's private AIM/MeshGideon/kirocrew fleet complete with their
  internal descriptions (`K2`), and (b) a **57-tool** surface that includes `get_aws_creds`,
  `configure_aws_access`, `use_aws` and the entire Concur expense-write set
  (`submit_expense_report`, `create_expense_report`, `delete_report`, `switch_delegate`) (`K4`).
  Every host-managed kiro session can therefore mint cloud credentials and submit expense reports,
  and per `G27` the host cannot guarantee it will even be asked. kiro reads `AWS_*`/`KIRO_*`
  environment and its own `~/.kiro` tree, so — as with codex — `AAP-5` has nothing to flip and the
  mechanism must be built. Owner: agent app bundle + core seam.

**P1 — capability-dead**

- **`G29` A kiro session that has ever been in plan mode is permanently wedged, and the stale
  framing asserts its own freshness.** The task-mode block is fixed when the CLI process is created
  and never refreshed for that process's later turns, so after `POST /api/chat/task-mode
  {mode:"agent"}` the API reports `task_mode: agent`, the host gate *enforces* agent, and the model
  still receives `## Task mode: Plan` and refuses every tool request (`K23`). The injected text
  makes recovery impossible by instruction: it tells the model *"This posture is current as of THIS
  turn … if a previous reply refused because it was in a different mode, re-evaluate against the
  mode stated here and don't carry that refusal forward"* — so the model correctly trusts the wrong
  value and no amount of re-asking helps. The control (`K24`: the same session on a fresh process
  reads `## Task mode: Agent`) locates the bug precisely in per-turn re-injection for a **reused**
  process. This is reachable by a single UI mode toggle, the user's only escape is a gateway
  restart, and it is invisible to claude and codex because they respawn every turn — i.e. kiro's
  one efficiency advantage (`K8`) is what exposes it. Owner: core seam.
- **`G30` After a gateway restart a persisted ACP session cannot be re-bound.** `POST
  …/{session}/acp-agent` returns `{"error": "not found"}` for every pre-restart session while `GET
  /api/chat/sessions` lists them; the session becomes re-bindable only after a `POST /api/chat`
  touches it, and that touch is exactly the call that hard-errors on the native axis because the
  binding is gone (`K21`, `K20`). So the repair sequence is "send a message, receive an unexplained
  provider error, then re-bind", and nothing surfaces it. This is why `AAP-2` was able to re-bind
  after its restart — it had already sent a turn. `G5` loses the binding; `G30` is why the user
  cannot simply put it back. Owner: core seam.
- **`G31` `gideon.json` is generated correctly and stored where kiro never looks — and the
  planned fix would make isolated sessions write to the real home.** The host writes a complete
  `$GIDEON_HOME/agents/gideon.json` (`tools`/`allowedTools` = `["@gideon-core"]`,
  `mcpServers.gideon-core` = `<venv>/gideon mcp-core`); kiro's only agent roots are
  `<cwd>/.kiro/agents` and `~/.kiro/agents`, which it prints in `kiro-cli agent list`, and
  `$GIDEON_HOME/agents/` is neither, so `gideon` never appears among its 24 discovered
  agents (`K6`). This closes the audit's "kiro's discovery … is unverified" as **not honored** and
  confirms §2.1 Prong B is required. **But Prong B as written ("symlink or copy … into
  `~/.kiro/agents/`") would activate a real-home write:** that file's `hooks.postToolUse` command is
  `… >> ~/.gideon/audit.log` with a **literal tilde**, not `$GIDEON_HOME`, so the moment
  the file is honored every isolated-home ACP session appends to the operator's real home. Fix the
  path in the generator in the same change. Owner: core seam (generator) + agent app bundle
  (placement).
- **`G32` Concurrent sessions are declared, gated on, and do not happen.** `agent.acp_concurrent_
  sessions` was set true and verified in `config.json`, `default` dialect declares
  `supports_concurrent_sessions = True`, an in-process check returns
  `concurrent_sessions_enabled('default') == True`, and `AcpPool._shared_connection` caches its
  connection on `runtime_id` alone — yet three bound sessions ran on three separate CLI trees
  (`K7`). Since kiro's tree is five processes deep (`kiro-cli` → `aim sandbox` → AIM `launcher` →
  app-bundle `kiro-cli` → `kiro-cli-chat`), the cost of the miss is 5 processes per chat, and the
  P9 spike that set `supports_concurrent_sessions = True` is the only evidence the path ever ran.
  Either the dashboard chat path never reaches `_open_shared_acp_session` or it fails into its
  silent `except Exception: return None` — both shapes are invisible at every surface a user or
  operator can see. Owner: core seam; needs a log line on the fallback before anything else.
- **`G33` `session_pid_<pid>.txt` is written for only some sessions, so subagent inject-back
  silently holds for some chats and not others.** Three sessions with three live CLI processes
  produced **one** pid file (`K9`), where codex produced one per session. §2.1's acceptance
  criterion names this file as the resolution mechanism for subagent completion inject-back, so
  that criterion would pass or fail per-chat with nothing distinguishing them in the UI. Owner:
  core seam.

**P2 — fidelity**

- **`G34` The read/safe auto-approve is decided by adapter prose, so the honest provider is the one
  that gets carded.** kiro's `pwd` arrives with `risk: "safe"` and `is_read_only: "1"` and still
  blocks on a card, because the classifier keys off the adapter's title and kiro titles it
  `Running: pwd` → `kind: execute` (`K5`); codex's identical shell `exec_command` titled `Read file
  '…'` → `kind: read` and auto-approved (`AAP-2`'s `C5`, `C10`). One provider's users approve every
  `ls`; the other's shell calls sail through on a mislabel. The classification input should be the
  protocol's own read-only hint, which kiro already sends and the host ignores. Owner: core seam.
- **`G35` One tool call produces two SEL rows that disagree about its risk.** The same read logged
  `invoked | {"risk": "safe"}` and `approved | {"reason": "interactive", "risk": "caution"}` (`K13`),
  so the audit trail contains two different effective risks for one event and any consumer that
  aggregates by risk is wrong depending on which row it reads. Owner: core seam.
- **`G36` The deny-list's reason reaches the user and not the audit log.** The blocked `git push`
  showed `blocked: Blocked by security policy: *git*push*` in the tool line, while its SEL `denied`
  row carries `metadata: {}` — the pattern that fired is absent from the only durable record
  (`K25`). Compare the task-mode denial, which *does* record `{"reason": "task_mode:ask"}`. Owner:
  core seam.
- **`G37` A card is two different shapes depending on which surface reads it.** The `approval`
  frame carries `id` + `risk` and no `tool_kind`; `pending_approval_info` on `GET
  /api/chat/sessions` carries `request_id` + `tool_kind` and **no `risk`** (`K5`, `K12`). So a
  REST-polling consumer cannot show risk, a WS consumer cannot show kind, and the id field is named
  differently in each — a client that resolves cards by `id` from the REST shape sends an empty
  string. Owner: core seam; one payload, both surfaces.
- **`AAP-2`'s `G21` is confirmed on the provider §2.6 named it for.** `supported_efforts: []` on all
  27 kiro agents, and a bind with `reasoning_effort: "low"` is accepted, persisted and echoed back
  (`K2`, `K10`) — so "grey the pill on kiro" has its measurement, and keying the fix off
  `supported_efforts` covers both providers as `G21` predicted. No new number.

**P3 — cosmetic / legibility / methodology**

- **`G38` Use kiro as the context-dump provider until a host-side dump exists — it retires `G26`'s
  blocker.** `AAP-2` filed `G26` because codex refuses ("I can't provide hidden context or
  instructions"), leaving the task-mode framing, persona and cancelled-turn-preamble cells
  unclosable and Phase 1's "zero UNKNOWN" bar dependent on new harness work. kiro returns its
  assembled framing verbatim on request (`K23`, `K24`), which is how `G29` — the most serious
  functional bug in this sweep — was proven rather than guessed. So the harness need is real but no
  longer blocking: prompt-side cells can be validated on kiro today, and `AAP-4`'s parity doc should
  say so. Owner: whoever runs the remaining Phase 1 follow-ups.

**Negative results worth keeping** (so nobody re-chases them): the hard deny-list **does** cover ACP
tools and names the pattern to the user (`K25`) — the first positive on that cell in three sweeps;
task-mode enforcement blocks both ask-mode and plan-mode writes and reports why, inline, without
killing the turn (`K14`, `K22`); session trust works and is honoured per-session (`K15`); queued
mid-turn messages drain end-to-end (`K15`); the per-session process is genuinely reused across turns
(`K8`) so the warm pool is warm on at least one provider; **every** kiro process tree was reaped when
the gateway died — zero orphans, where `AAP-1` leaked two (`K19`); SEL names every tool honestly on
kiro (`K12`, `K13`); and the on-disk `~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json` `expiresAt` is **not** an
auth-freshness signal (five weeks expired beside a working refresh token), so a future sweep must
prove auth with a live call rather than by reading that file.

### Incidental bugs fixed in-session (kiro-cli)

**None.** Every defect this sweep localised is structural and shared, so the plan's own rule applies
("anything structural waits for Phase 2 so fixes land against the full three-provider picture"), and
the two that look smallest are the two that would have been worst to half-fix:

- `G29`'s one-line-looking cause (the task-mode framing not re-injected on a reused ACP process) sits
  in the shared per-turn context assembly, which every provider and the native runtime traverse.
  Changing when that block is rebuilt without the three-provider picture risks re-breaking the
  compressed-history bootstrap that `4a` shows *working*.
- `G31`'s real-home hook path is one string in `agent.py`'s generator, but that generator's output is
  also the artifact §2.1 Prong B plans to place into `~/.kiro/agents/`; the path and the placement are
  one decision and belong in the same change.

`G27` (the gate is not universal), `G34` (auto-approve keyed on adapter prose), `G35`/`G36`/`G37` (SEL
and card-payload shapes) all live in `acp/translate.py` and the shared chat-runner gate path — the same
files `AAP-2` declined to touch, and outside this atom's fence. Each is filed with its exact wire
evidence instead.

## Execution log

- 2026-08-17 — `AAP-1` **PARTIAL**. Ran the audit §6 checklist against `acp:claude-code`
  (adapter `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` 0.60.0, `claude` 2.1.233.669) on an isolated
  home, 19 turns across 6 sessions plus a gateway restart. 63 audit cells marked: 35 CONFIRMED,
  6 DIVERGED, 22 NOT-EXERCISED (residual list above). All four of the audit's literal `UNKNOWN`
  cells resolved. 16 findings filed P0-P3; two P0s (`G1` cwd/home escape, `G2` contingent gate
  coverage) and four P1s. Zero incidental fixes — every defect landed outside the atom's fence.
  **DISCOVERY:** the audit's biggest predicted hole (gap 2, CLI auto-approve bypassing the host
  gate) did **not** reproduce on claude-code — every one of the 44 SEL-audited tool events surfaced
  `session/request_permission` — but only because config isolation is off by default and this
  operator's settings auto-approve nothing, so `AAP-5`'s job is to make that coverage structural
  rather than to build a new gate. **DISCOVERY:** three cells the audit marked WIRED are broken
  (slash commands, session resume, project cwd) and one marked PARTIAL prints a fabricated
  number (context-%).
- 2026-08-17 — `AAP-2` **PARTIAL**. Ran the audit §6 checklist against `acp:codex` (adapter
  `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` 1.1.4, `codex` 0.146.1.359 on an Amazon-Bedrock model provider)
  on an isolated home, 17 turns across 4 sessions plus a fork, a regenerate, a mid-turn stop and a
  gateway restart. The same 63 audit cells marked: **33 CONFIRMED, 10 DIVERGED, 20 NOT-EXERCISED**
  (residual list above). All four of the audit's literal `UNKNOWN` cells plus the two it flagged for
  codex specifically (compaction, slash commands) are now definite. Ten findings filed `G17`-`G26`:
  one P0, three P1s, five P2s, one P3/methodology. Zero incidental fixes — both precisely localised
  defects live in `acp/translate.py` and the shared gate path, outside this atom's fence.
  **DISCOVERY:** eleven of AAP-1's sixteen findings reproduce on a different adapter, CLI and
  vendor (`G1`, `G3`-`G8`, `G13`-`G16`), which promotes them from claude-code behavior to host-side
  defects; `/compact` fails with the byte-identical `-32601 _vendor.dev/commands/execute` error, so
  `G4` is a host bug, not an adapter gap. **DISCOVERY:** `G2` does not reproduce — it is worse.
  codex has **no** `GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE` equivalent at all (the bundle disclaims isolation by
  design), so every host-managed codex session runs with the operator's 12 MCP servers live, their
  skills loaded, 31 descendant processes, and writes host-driven conversation transcripts into the
  operator's real `~/.codex` — `AAP-5` has no lever to flip here and must build one (`G17`).
  **DISCOVERY:** codex's `session/request_permission` payload carries the `kind` that AAP-1's `G10`
  said only the `tool_call` frame has, and its `session/update` carries a fully structured diff
  (`type: diff`, `oldText`, `newText`, `path`) — the host discards both, so the approval card cannot
  even name the tool (`G18`) and the diff chip §2.5 wants is already on the wire (`G22`).
  **DISCOVERY:** three cells AAP-1 could not close are now closed on codex — queued messages drain
  end-to-end, session trust does **not** bypass task mode, and plan mode is **not** native on codex
  (only the host gate stops it, the kiro shape the audit did not predict here). A task-mode denial
  also kills the entire codex turn (`G19`), while a rejected approval card is graceful.
- 2026-08-17/18 — `AAP-3` **PARTIAL**, and **Phase 1 is now complete: three checked-in verified
  matrix columns.** Ran the audit §6 checklist against `acp:kiro-cli` (`kiro-cli` 2.18.1, **no
  adapter** — it speaks ACP natively via `kiro-cli acp` on the core `default` dialect) on an isolated
  home, 20 turns across 6 sessions plus two gateway restarts, a fork, a mid-turn stop, a deny-list
  probe and a context dump. **Auth precondition satisfied FIRST and three ways** — `~/.midway/cookie`
  32 minutes old, `kiro-cli whoami` resolving to an IAM Identity Center identity, and a live model
  call returning `AUTHOK` — so **no cell is recorded as `ENV`**; every failure below is a capability
  observation. The same 63 audit cells marked: **31 CONFIRMED, 12 DIVERGED, 20 NOT-EXERCISED**
  (residual list above). All four of the audit's literal `UNKNOWN` cells, the two it flagged for kiro
  (compaction, slash commands) and **all three unknowns this atom was scoped to close** are now
  definite. Twelve findings filed `G27`-`G38`: two P0s, five P1s, four P2s, one P3/methodology, plus a
  measured confirmation of `AAP-2`'s `G21` on the provider §2.6 named it for. Zero incidental fixes —
  every defect is structural and shared, and the two smallest-looking ones are the two that would be
  worst to half-fix.
  **DISCOVERY (the one that matters most):** `AAP-1`'s `G2` is no longer contingent — it is
  **measured**. Seven of thirteen tool calls in a single turn executed with **no permission request
  at all** (kiro's native `todo_list`), each labelled `risk: "destructive"` by the host, in the same
  turns where the read, write and `rm` were carded. `AAP-2` concluded "no ACP tool executed without
  passing the host gate"; on a third provider that is false, so host safety on ACP is opt-in **by the
  CLI** and Success Criterion 3 is not met (`G27`).
  **DISCOVERY:** the three named unknowns resolved as — `gideon.json` is generated *correctly*
  and stored where kiro provably never looks (`kiro-cli agent list` prints its two roots; neither is
  `$GIDEON_HOME/agents/`), and the file's own `postToolUse` hook writes to a **literal**
  `~/.gideon/audit.log`, so §2.1 Prong B's planned symlink would activate a real-home write
  (`G31`); the effort pill is a **silent no-op that round-trips** on a provider advertising
  `supported_efforts: []`, confirming `G21`; and concurrent sessions are **declared, gated on, and
  absent** — flag true, dialect true, `concurrent_sessions_enabled('default')` true, connection cached
  on `runtime_id` alone, yet three sessions ran on three five-deep process trees (`G32`).
  **DISCOVERY:** ten of `AAP-1`'s sixteen findings reproduce on a provider with **no adapter**, a third
  vendor and a third auth model (`G1`, `G3`-`G8`, `G13`, `G15`, `G16`), which settles them as host-side
  defects rather than adapter behavior; `/compact` fails identically for the third time. But **three
  prior findings do NOT reproduce, which narrows their fixes**: `G18` (kiro names every tool in cards,
  `pending_approval_info` and SEL — never `unknown`), `G19` (a task-mode denial is graceful and legible
  on kiro, so it is codex-specific) and `G26` (kiro quotes its assembled context verbatim, so the
  prompt-side cells are measurable today — `G38`).
  **DISCOVERY:** kiro is the only provider that **reuses one CLI process across a session's turns**,
  which makes its warm pool demonstrably warm — and is exactly what exposes `G29`: the task-mode
  framing is fixed at process creation, so a session switched from Plan back to Agent keeps receiving
  `## Task mode: Plan` and refuses every tool forever, while the API and the host gate both say
  `agent` and the stale block itself insists *"This posture is current as of THIS turn"*. A gateway
  restart is the user's only escape — and `G30` shows that restart cannot re-bind the provider it just
  cleared until an erroring `POST /api/chat` touches the session first.
  **DISCOVERY (positive):** the hard deny-list **does** cover ACP tools and names the pattern to the
  user — the first positive result on that cell in three sweeps — and every kiro process tree was
  reaped when the gateway died (zero orphans, where `AAP-1` leaked two). Also recorded for future
  sweeps: `~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json`'s `expiresAt` is **five weeks expired** beside a
  working refresh token, so that file is not an auth-freshness signal and reading it would mis-file
  working cells as `ENV`.

- 2026-08-18 — `AAP-5` **PARTIAL** (§2.2, gap 2 — the safety hole). Made the HOST the permission
  authority on the ACP path and, where it provably cannot be, made the *absence* of a gate legible.
  Four mechanisms: (1) `acp/permission_authority.sanitize_mode` clamps every requested native mode
  — called from `AcpClient.__init__` **and** `set_mode`, the chokepoint every path crosses
  (factory kwarg, bundle entry option, per-session override, loop/planning worker) **and** from
  `AcpSessionProvider.set_mode`, the pooled path's SECOND door (found by asking who else builds
  the dialect request directly — it bypasses `AcpClient` entirely, so clamping only the wrapper
  would have left the concurrent path open), so
  `acceptEdits`/`dontAsk`/`bypassPermissions`/`yolo` and any *unrecognized* mode become `default`
  with an SEL `mode_change:clamped_to_host_authority` row; empty now becomes `default` too, because
  "whatever the CLI defaults to" WAS the hole. (2) the deny-list is evaluated against the REAL
  command, not the display title — `command_probe` feeds the cached `tool_call` input to the hook
  chain in the `"Running: "` form, DENY-only by contract so it can never widen. (3) the permission
  frame now carries the adapter's declared `kind` — used for the card/SEL/residue, deliberately NOT
  passed to `task_mode_denies` (a CLI that labels a mutation "read" must not turn that gate's
  deny-by-default into an allow). (4) `NOT_GATEABLE` + `_report_ungated_tool_call`: a tool result for
  a call the host was never asked about is audited (`ungated` / `ungated_declared`), flagged on the
  tool row's meta, announced in the activity feed, and — when undeclared AND non-safe under
  ask/plan — aborts the turn via `session/cancel`.
  **Driven, not reasoned:** real `kiro-cli acp`, isolated home, `AAP5_REQUESTED_MODE=bypassPermissions`
  → clamped live to `default`; the CLI's own `pwd` returned the cwd we passed, so `G1`'s escape did
  not touch this drive. Turn A (pwd + write + rm): 3 tool calls, **3 gated**. Turn B (todo list +
  write + read): 6 tool calls, **1 gated, 5 ungated**. Replaying those VERBATIM frames through the
  real `_run_chat` gate with trust ON: under `task_mode=ask` the write and the `rm` are rejected with
  the standard "Ask mode — only read-only tools run" message while read-only `pwd` still runs, and
  under `task_mode=agent` the same write approves — the requirement and its inverse floor on real
  frames, with the vacuity floor satisfied inside one turn (the gate fires on the write while five
  other calls are ungateable).
  **DISCOVERY:** `G27`'s residue is WIDER than recorded. kiro does not only skip `todo_list` — it
  **self-approves its own file reads**: in one turn `Creating todo_probe.txt` raised a card while
  `Reading todo_probe.txt:1-10` (`kind="read"`) did not. Both are now declared entries; the read
  resolves to effective risk SAFE, so it is labelled and never turn-aborting. That asymmetry is the
  reason the abort rule keys on *undeclared AND non-safe* rather than on "ungated": enforcing on
  "ungated" alone would abort five of every six kiro turns.
  **DEVIATION:** the residual set is enumerated in CODE (`NOT_GATEABLE`), not in §2.7's
  `docs/agents/acp-parity.md` — that doc does not exist yet and belongs to a later atom; it should
  render the registry. **DEVIATION:** `sanitize_mode`'s `unattended=True` escape exists but nothing
  wires it — the bridge still pops `unattended` for ACP (§2.3 owns that), so loop/planning workers
  now get `default` and execute because their session already carries `_trust`; the approval becomes
  AUDITED instead of invisible, which is the intended direction, but §2.3 must thread `unattended`
  before any un-trusted background ACP run can be non-wedging. **DEVIATION:** the apps-repo half of
  the mechanism (flip `GIDEON_CC_ISOLATE` from opt-in to the bundled default in
  `claude-code-agent/provider.py:_build_env`) is NOT landed — cross-repo, handed to the owner as an
  exact diff. That lever exists ONLY in the apps bundle; core `src/` never mentions it.
  **BOUNDARY:** claude-code and codex were not re-driven live (their adapters are not installed on
  this machine), so their "residual set EMPTY" entries carry `AAP-1`/`AAP-2`'s measurement, not a
  fresh one — and per `G27` an empty set is a measurement, never a guarantee.
- 2026-08-18 — `AAP-4` **PARTIAL** (§2.1 MCP reachability, gap 1). Both prongs implemented and
  **both measured working on kiro-cli**, the only ACP CLI installed on this machine; claude-code and
  codex are NOT-EXERCISED for the honest reason that their adapters are absent.
  **Prong A (protocol) — `O18`'s open question is now ANSWERED for kiro: HONORED.** `client.py`'s
  three `session/new`/`session/load` sites and the pooled opener now carry the `gideon-core`
  spec (name + `gideon mcp-core` + an `env` array). Driven end to end, kiro spawned the server
  from the protocol field alone (a `gideon mcp-core` process appeared for the session's life,
  with no seeded config present) and invoked `@gideon-core/get_context` and
  `@gideon-core/notify`; `notify` returned `Message sent.` and the notification landed in the
  isolated home. So `G3`'s "no `gideon-core` surface at all" is closed for kiro **without any
  user-config mutation** — the outcome §2.1 called "the clean fix".
  **Session inject-back CONFIRMED via the env leg:** the SEL rows for the turn carry
  `caller_identity = <the session key passed in the spec's env>`, i.e. `mcp_core._resolve_session_key`
  read `GIDEON_SESSION_KEY` off the protocol-passed env. The `session_pid_<pid>.txt` leg was
  NOT exercised here (the probe is not the gateway's session manager, which owns those files);
  `O11` already measured that file as written on the real path.
  **Prong B (seeding) — measured discoverable, and the plan's placement is worse than an
  alternative.** `gideon` appears in kiro's `availableModes` (27 → 28 agents) once the
  generated config is seeded. **DISCOVERY:** seeding `<cwd>/.kiro/agents/` — kiro's *workspace*
  discovery root, which for an ACP session is the Gideon workspace dir — is discovered just as
  reliably as `~/.kiro/agents/` and mutates nothing of the user's real config. §2.1 prong B should
  prefer the cwd root over the `~/.kiro/agents/` symlink it currently specifies.
  **`G31` fixed at the generator.** The bundled bash-audit hook's literal `~/.gideon/audit.log`
  now resolves against `config_dir()` at generation time (a `{{GIDEON_AUDIT_LOG}}` token
  expanded in `agent.build_agent_config` / `_refresh_dynamic_fields`, fail-closed on any surviving
  placeholder). Verified in the live generated file, and the operator's real
  `~/.gideon/audit.log` was **never created** across the whole session — including the seeded
  run where kiro genuinely loaded our agent config — with the real home's file count identical
  before and after.
  **BLOCKER on two acceptance clauses (premise mismatch, not a wiring gap):** §2.1's acceptance and
  Success Criterion 2 name `knowledge_search` and `task_create`, but **neither tool exists in the
  `gideon-core` surface**. `mcp-core` serves 68 tools (artifacts / workflows / memory /
  subagents / skills / automation / notify), matching `:34`'s own description; `knowledge_search` and
  `task_create` are **native-registry-only** (`agents/native/builtin_tools.py`). No amount of
  reachability wiring can surface them — exporting those two tool groups from `mcp_core` is separate
  scope. `notify` and `subagent_run` ARE in the surface (`notify` driven; `subagent_run` present in
  the session's tool list but not invoked).
  **DISCOVERY (inert control):** the bundled `postToolUse|bash` audit hook can never fire for our own
  generated agent, because that config's `tools`/`allowedTools` is exactly `["@gideon-core"]` —
  it has no bash tool to post-hook. The hook is correct and now correctly-pathed, and still dead for
  the one agent it ships with.
  **NOTE for the owner:** prong B's seeder has no production declarer. It is deliberately opt-in via
  a new `agent_config_dir` parameter on `register_acp_cli_entry` (which directory a CLI reads is
  vendor knowledge, so it stays in the bundle), and no bundle declares it because prong A is measured
  to work on the only CLI we can drive. That is one line in `GideonApps/kiro-cli-agent/
  provider.py` whenever a CLI is measured to ignore the protocol field.
