# PROACTIVE-ASSISTANT

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/PA.md`](../atomic/PA.md) as 6 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Proactive Assistant — Triage Flagship + Personal Decision Journal

**Status:** PROPOSED (rev 2 — research-integrated 2026-07-12)  
**Created:** 2026-07-12  
**Depends on:** WORKFLOWS-V2.md Slices 0-2 (run engine + ledger); WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE.md steps 1-5 (event bus, `triggers.json`, typed-outcome run records, delivery contract) incl. the approved AUTO-R19 `pulse` kind (referenced, not duplicated); AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS NEW-1 (budget floor) + NEW-2 (typed structured-output substrate); WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL.md §3.3 (LEARN-R18 pending→resolved outcome lessons)  
**Scope:** The capstone *composed experience* over the substrate plans — the first automations a user feels every morning, not more plumbing

---

## Research Integration (2026-07-12)

Two approved recommendations folded in (mechanism-level, not appendix):

- **NEW-26** — Proactive Triage flagship: scheduled digest-collect → classifier gate → tiered strict-JSON proposals → persistent approval memory → trivial-tier auto-execution → run-outcome ranking → §1 (all sub-sections), §4 tools, §5 FE, sessions 1-3
- **NEW-23** — Personal Decision Journal: horizon-triggered review, outcome capture, calibration record, LEARN-R18 pairing → §2, §4 tools, §5 FE, sessions 4-5

---

## Overview

The substrate plans build the machine; this plan builds the two experiences that justify it. Both are **compositions** — nearly every ingredient exists or is planned elsewhere, and this plan's job is to name the composed product, specify the few genuinely new pieces, and keep them plugged into the provider architecture the way everything else is.

1. **Proactive Triage (NEW-26).** Every morning (and on demand) Gideon collects what accumulated across inbox items, channel sessions, and background-run outcomes; a lightweight classifier gate filters what matters; a strict-JSON stage emits *tiered action proposals* (trivial / low / medium / high); trivial-tier items and items matching a stored always-approve rule execute automatically under the NEW-1 budget floor; everything else lands as one digest whose one-word replies ("3 yes", "always no 3", "yes all") both act *and teach* — "always" answers persist as pattern-keyed approval rules the next digest consults. The digest leads with what mattered because ranking consumes the substrate's run-outcome classification (AUTO-R2's materiality predicate: action-vs-response weight + extracted artifact permalinks), not raw recency.

2. **Personal Decision Journal (NEW-23).** Log any real-life decision — career, financial, technical, personal — with expectations and a review horizon. The decision is a **user item** (knowledge side). At horizon, a one-shot trigger surfaces a review prompt; an outcome-capture dialogue records what actually happened; the distilled 2-4 sentence evidence-citing lesson is **harness memory** (memory side), written through the LEARN-R18 pending→resolved lifecycle the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL plan already owns. Over time the journal becomes a calibration record: predicted confidence vs realized outcome, per decision domain.

**Soul guardrail:** personal-scale, single user, local files. Proactive behaviors **propose; they never silently write** — the only auto-execution is the trivial tier plus explicitly-taught always-approve rules, both bounded by NEW-1 budgets and revocable in one click. The autonomy shape is Leon's bounded Pulse Engine and Memoh's heartbeat-vs-schedule split: the *scheduled* digest (an explicit clock trigger the user owns) stays orthogonal to the *self-directed* `pulse` kind (AUTO-R19, substrate §1.2/§7 step 10) — this plan ships the scheduled half and consumes pulse output as one more digest source when Phase 2 lands. No enterprise machinery: the approval store is memory rows, the journal is knowledge items, the rules manager is one settings card.

### Starting points (verified against code, 2026-07-12 recon)

- **Inbox alert evaluation happens ONCE at ingestion** — `evaluate_alert` (inbox.py L270: case-insensitive `alert_keywords` substring + `alert_on_name_mention` whole-word match) runs inside `InboxService._ingest` (inbox_service.py L194) and never re-evaluates stored items. The triage classifier gate (§1.2) deliberately runs at *digest time over stored items*, so it is not subject to that gotcha — the two mechanisms coexist: alerts are the real-time tripwire, triage is the batch review.
- **Inbox AI affordances already exist as one-shots**: classify / draft_reply / generate_digest via `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` over stored items, external text wrapped in `fence_untrusted` (`_fence_message`), prompts via `render_use_case_prompt("inbox_classify|inbox_draft|inbox_digest")`. The triage pipeline *extends* this pattern (new use-case prompts, same resolution and fencing path) rather than building a second background-LLM stack.
- **Only two inbox sources exist and source wiring is hard-coded**: `filesystem_source` (the poll default) and `native_source` (always-on push sink); gateway `_init_inbox` asks `get_default_provider("filesystem")` only, and Slack is *deliberately not* an inbox source (gateway L1626). "Digest-collect over inbox sources" therefore means: stored inbox items + channel-session surfaces + run-ledger outcomes — NOT a fan-out over N pollable providers that don't exist. New sources arrive later via the `MessageSourceProvider` ABC (inbox_providers/base.py: `poll/send_reply/add_reaction/get_channel_history`) and the WATCHED-SOURCES plan; the collect stage is written against the ABC so they slot in without touching triage.
- **The notification gate is singular**: `DashboardState.notify` (dashboard/state.py:1023) → `notification_allowed(kind)` (providers/entity_routes.py:171 — `mute_all` → `min_severity` rank → quiet-hours suppress <error). Digest delivery routes through it; this plan builds no second path.
- **Commitments are a MemoryKind, not a file**: `record_commitment` lives in memory_service.py L558-651 with hard-coded guardrails (opt-in `memory.proactive_commitments`, confidence ≥0.8, ≤3 active/day/agent, key `user.commitment.<md5-12>`), delivered by the heartbeat's `_deliver_due_commitments` scan — which the substrate converts to one-shot `clock/at` triggers with `delete_after_run` (substrate disposition table). The decision journal's horizon reminders (§2.3) reuse *that* conversion pattern, and the approval memory (§1.4) reuses the *key-prefix precedent* (`user.approval.<md5-12>` beside `user.commitment.<md5-12>`).
- **Memory semantic keys are constrained**: regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9_.]*[a-z0-9]$`, ≤100 chars, value ≤4096 B (vector_memory.py); kind is inferred from key prefix (`_kind_from_key`, memory_record.py L310); non-fact prefixes are excluded from ambient fact injection via `_NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE` (vector_memory.py L383). OpenJARVIS-style colon-delimited rule keys (`email_delete:domain:noreply.github.com`) are **invalid as memory keys** — the pattern lives in `value_json`, the key is the hash (§1.4).
- **Knowledge is the user-item side**: one global library, `knowledge.db`, 12 `NATIVE_TYPES`, one ingest queue, `create_typed_item(provider="native")` + `ingest_queue.enqueue` as THE creation path; Passthrough pipeline graph covers note/gist/journal/fleeting. The `decision` type (§2.1) is the 13th native type riding Passthrough. There is **no cross-linking between memory records and knowledge items** today — the journal keeps it that way structurally (soft references by id in `value_json`/metadata, no FK).
- **The run-outcome classifier is NOT new**: substrate §1.3 already specifies the materiality predicate (AUTO-R2, tryfriday's action|response|error derivation from the journaled tool calls, with extracted external permalinks). Triage ranking (§1.5) *consumes* those typed ledger rows; this plan adds zero run instrumentation.

---

## 1. Proactive Triage Flagship (NEW-26)

Shipped as a **bundled workflow-template pack** ("Morning triage") — a WorkflowDef with a clock trigger pre-attached, installable in one click and fully editable, exactly like the substrate's §5.3 templates. The pipeline is five stages; stages 1-2 are deterministic/cheap, 3 is the one strict-JSON LLM call, 4-5 are rule-driven.

### 1.1 Stage 1 — Collect

A digest-collect node gathers, per configured window (default: since last successful digest run):

- **Inbox items**: unread/pending rows from `InboxStore` (inbox.json), already fenced at rest; muted threads and dismissed items excluded (existing `InboxState` filters).
- **Channel activity**: unresolved threads across channel sessions (`channel:` session keys) via the channel transports' history surface.
- **Background-run outcomes**: typed rows from the substrate Run Ledger since the window start — the materiality-classified fires (§1.5 consumes these for ranking; the digest's "what your machine did" section renders the productive rows' written/learned diffs + artifact permalinks directly from substrate §1.3 records).
- **Pulse proposals** *(Phase 2, when AUTO-R19 lands)*: pending matters from the pulse queue fold in as one more digest section — the digest becomes the pulse's delivery surface, keeping Memoh's split intact (pulse *generates* self-directed matters; the scheduled digest *presents* them).

Each collected item gets a stable per-digest ordinal id (`1`, `2`, …) and a one-line rendering. **Anti-hallucination contract (OpenJARVIS):** downstream stages must copy item ids *exactly* from these digest lines; any proposal referencing an id not in the collect manifest is dropped with a `refused` ledger outcome.

### 1.2 Stage 2 — Classifier gate (optional, cheap)

Per-source natural-language filter rules ("from GitHub notifications only surface review requests; skip dependabot"), evaluated by a small background-tier model — this is the substrate's fire→spawn triage stage (§3.6, LocalAGI ClassifierFilter convergence) applied at digest scope: verdicts `{drop | surface | propose}`, decisions cached on item fingerprint, `skipped_triage` ledger rows carry the rationale. Resolution via `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` per the plug-in map; zero-item windows short-circuit before any LLM spend (the gcp-always-on precondition-guard pattern: one cheap store query decides whether the LLM stage runs at all).

### 1.3 Stage 3 — Tiered strict-JSON proposals

ONE LLM call over the fenced, surviving items emits an action-proposal array — schema-enforced through the NEW-2 typed structured-output substrate (`additionalProperties: false`, length caps, max 8 proposals per run):

```json
{
  "proposals": [{
    "item_id": "3",                  // MUST match a collect-manifest ordinal exactly
    "action_type": "archive|reply_draft|create_task|mute_thread|dismiss|remind|none",
    "action_config": { },            // args for the bound action provider, schema per action_type
    "tier": "trivial|low|medium|high",
    "pattern_key": "reply_draft:sender:github.com",  // the generalization this proposal instantiates
    "reasoning": "one sentence"
  }]
}
```

- **Tier assignment is prompt-guided but policy-clamped**: a deterministic post-pass caps the tier by action class (anything that sends/posts externally is never below `medium`; destructive ops never below `high`), so a jailbroken prompt cannot self-assign `trivial`. Fail-closed: unparseable output → the run degrades to a plain digest with zero proposals, `refused` outcome, never a retry loop against the schema.
- All item content crosses this stage **fenced** (`fence_untrusted` with provenance attrs per substrate decision 4) — an inbox item containing injection text can at worst produce a proposal, and proposals only *bind arguments to the pre-declared action set* (frozen action-set invariant, substrate decision 7); they can never introduce actions.

### 1.4 Stage 4 — Approval memory (the learning half)

**Routing per proposal:**

| Condition | Route |
|---|---|
| stored `always_deny` rule matches `pattern_key` | silently skip → `skipped_gate` ledger row naming the rule |
| tier `trivial` OR stored `always_approve` rule matches | auto-execute (§1.6) |
| else | queue pending in the digest |

**Reply grammar (deterministic, no LLM):** the digest delivery thread accepts one-word replies parsed by a small grammar — `3 yes` / `3 no` (act once), `always yes 3` / `always no 3` (act + persist a rule from that proposal's `pattern_key`), `yes all` / `no all`. Replies arrive over whatever surface delivered the digest: a channel reply (the `ChannelTransportProvider` inbound path — the substrate's stable event-id makes acks idempotent) or the inbox reply path (`MessageSourceProvider.send_reply` is the confirmation affordance). Unparseable replies get a help line back, never an LLM interpretation — the grammar IS the safety boundary.

**Rule persistence — memory side, explicitly.** Learned approve/deny patterns are the *harness's model of how the user wants it to behave* — memory, not knowledge. Storage follows the commitments precedent exactly:

- Semantic rows keyed `user.approval.<md5-12(pattern)>` (valid under the key regex; the raw pattern string like `archive:sender:noreply.github.com` lives in `value_json` alongside `{verdict: approve|deny, action_type, scope, created_from_digest, hit_count, last_hit_at, expires_at?}`).
- `user.approval.` joins the prefix set in `_kind_from_key` (memory_record.py) as an `approval` MemoryKind, and joins `_NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE` so rules never leak into ambient fact-injection blocks — they are policy lookups, not conversation context.
- Lookup at triage time is a **deterministic prefix query** (`MemoryProvider.query(kinds=[approval])` + exact/most-specific pattern match), never vector search — approval decisions must be exact.
- Like commitments, approval rules **never promote by heat** and are scope-bounded; unlike commitments they have no daily cap (they are user-taught, not agent-inferred) but DO carry optional `expires_at` and a hit-count so stale rules are visible.
- Writes route through the existing guarded path (`MemoryService` + S5 write-injection scan) — the rule text is derived from a proposal the user explicitly ratified, but it still passes the scanner.

**Suppression learning (Leon):** declining the *same* `pattern_key` repeatedly without saying "always no" applies escalating suppression cooldowns (24h → 7d → 30d) recorded on a shadow `user.approval.` row with `verdict: suppressed` — the digest stops re-proposing what the user keeps ignoring, without requiring them to formalize a rule. Accepting during a cooldown clears it.

### 1.5 Stage 5 — Rank + deliver

- Ranking: substrate §1.3 typed outcomes drive section order — externally-material items (runs that touched the world, items with pending external effects) lead; `response`-weight and no-op noise sinks or is folded into a one-line count. Artifact permalinks from the ledger render as deep links.
- Delivery: through the substrate's outbound delivery contract (decision 13) — `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()` gate (quiet hours/severity respected — a digest is `info`-ranked, so quiet hours defer it, which is correct for a *morning* digest), destination-aware formatting (rich block inbox/dashboard, flattened for `channel:slack`), stable event-id, statusUrl into the run journal.
- The whole digest run is a normal WorkflowRun: journaled, resumable, visible in the Runs inbox, autopause-on-true-failures per substrate §3.7.

### 1.6 Trivial-tier auto-execution — guardrails

Auto-execution is the sharpest edge; it is quadruple-bounded:

1. **NEW-1 budget floor** (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS): per-run/per-day token+dollar+action ceilings consulted before every auto-executed action; breach → remaining proposals demote to pending + needs-input, `skipped_budget` rows.
2. **Frozen capability set** (substrate decision 7): the triage template's trigger declares exactly the action providers proposals may bind (`inbox-op`, `create-task`, `send-message` draft-only, `notify`); the engine enforces at execution. External-send actions are NOT in the trivial-capable set by default — even an always-approve rule for `reply_draft` produces a *draft*, and graduating a pattern to actually-send is an explicit per-rule toggle rendered with a warning badge.
3. **Cap per run**: `max_auto_actions_per_run` (default 5) — the rest queue pending regardless of tier.
4. **Every auto-execution is a ledger row** with the matched rule named, and the digest's first section lists what was auto-done with one-click undo where the action provider supports it (archive/mute are reversible; that's why they're the trivial class).

**New action provider — `inbox-op`.** Archive / dismiss / mute-thread / mark-read / reply against `InboxStore` + the source provider's `send_reply`/`add_reaction`. Implements `ActionProvider` (action_providers/base.py), registered via `register_action_provider`, **added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555)**, settings schema via an `inbox-op-action` extension manifest — the full provider-fidelity checklist (see Plug-in Map). Once registered it is usable by ALL trigger kinds, not just triage.

## 2. Personal Decision Journal (NEW-23)

A product surface, not engine plumbing. The engine pieces (one-shot triggers, pending→resolved lesson lifecycle) belong to the substrate and LEARNING-FLYWHEEL respectively; this section specifies the data model, tools, and UX that make decision-tracking *ambient*.

**Boundary note up front (user directive):** a decision entry is a *user item* — a document about the user's life — and lives in **knowledge.db**. The distilled lesson the harness learns from its resolution is **memory** (a `lesson.*` semantic row via `write_lesson`). The calibration record is derived from knowledge items at read time. Nothing in this section writes memory except the final R18 lesson step, and nothing writes knowledge except the user's own entries and their resolution updates.

### 2.1 Data model — knowledge side

The research source (TradingAgents) proved the minimal shape with one markdown file + HTML-comment delimiters + status-in-tag lifecycle. Gideon has a better home for user items than a loose file: **`decision` becomes the 13th `NATIVE_TYPES` entry** (knowledge_providers/native), created through the one true path — `store.create_typed_item(item_type="decision", provider="native")` + `ingest_queue.enqueue` — riding the **Passthrough pipeline graph** (same class as note/journal: no scraping/extraction, straight to consolidate → entities → embed). What survives from the research shape is the *lifecycle*, not the file: append-only entries, `pending → resolved` status, pending entries never evicted.

Decision-specific structured fields ride the item's metadata JSON (no new columns needed; `_migrate` untouched):

```json
{
  "decision": {
    "status": "pending|resolved|abandoned",
    "domain": "career|financial|technical|personal|health|other",
    "expectation": "what I predict will happen",
    "confidence": 0.7,
    "options_considered": ["…"],
    "review_horizon": "2026-10-12",
    "reminder_trigger_id": "clock:…",
    "outcome": null,
    "outcome_captured_at": null,
    "lesson_memory_key": null
  }
}
```

`content` is the free-prose decision record (context, reasoning, stakes) — it embeds and retrieves like any knowledge item, shows up in the knowledge graph via entity extraction, and is @-pickable into chat. `lesson_memory_key` is a **soft string reference** to the eventual `lesson.*` row — deliberately not a FK; the two stores stay structurally uncoupled (recon: no cross-linking exists today, and we keep it that way).

### 2.2 `log_decision` chat tool

The ambient-capture affordance: mid-conversation, "log this as a decision" (or the agent offers when it detects one — offer-only, never auto-log). The tool:

1. Elicits/extracts `expectation`, `confidence`, `domain`, `review_horizon` (defaults: config `proactive.decision_default_horizon_days`, 90).
2. Creates the knowledge item via the native provider path.
3. Mints ONE one-shot review trigger: `Trigger{kind: clock, spec: {kind:'at', at: horizon, delete_after_run: true}, workflow: {ref: 'decision-review'}, created_by: 'system:decision-journal', delivery: inbox}` — deterministic id (`system:decision-journal:<item_id>`) so re-logging is idempotent, exactly the substrate's commitment-conversion pattern. Editing the horizon reschedules the trigger; abandoning the decision retires it.

Registered beside the existing knowledge tools (`agents/native/builtin_tools.py` L459-513, app `gideon-knowledge-tools`): `log_decision`, `decision_list(status?, domain?)`, `decision_resolve(id, outcome)`.

### 2.3 Horizon-triggered review + outcome capture

At horizon the trigger fires the bundled `decision-review` WorkflowDef:

1. Loads the decision item; delivers a review card to the **inbox** (through the notify gate — quiet hours respected) with the original expectation + confidence quoted back, and a statusUrl into the journal view.
2. The card opens an **outcome-capture dialogue** in chat (a linked session, the `to-chat` pattern): "You decided X expecting Y at 70% — what actually happened?" Structured capture: `outcome` prose + a simple resolution grade (`better|as_expected|worse|mixed|too_early`). `too_early` re-arms a new one-shot trigger (+50% horizon, capped at 2 deferrals — then the item surfaces as stale-pending in the journal view rather than nagging forever).
3. Resolution updates the knowledge item (`status: resolved`, outcome fields) and re-enqueues it for ingestion so the outcome text embeds too.

Non-response is fine: the trigger already fired and deleted itself; the pending card sits in the inbox under normal retention; the journal view shows overdue-pending items. No re-nag loop by default (personal-scale: one reminder per horizon, the surface does the rest).

### 2.4 Lesson distillation — memory side, via LEARN-R18

The decision journal is the *product face* of the pending-outcome lesson lifecycle LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 already specifies — this plan does **not** duplicate the resolver. Wiring: at resolution, the `decision-review` workflow files the R18 lesson-writer invocation with the decision item as evidence — strict format (2-4 sentences, plain prose, cite the stated expectation vs the captured outcome, one concrete lesson, every word earns its place — the TradingAgents write-time contract), written through `MemoryService.write_lesson` → a `lesson.<md5-12>` semantic row, deduped/superseded like any lesson. `lesson_memory_key` is stamped back on the knowledge item. Where a decision declared a *measurable* outcome (a metric + baseline), it instead journals a proper R18 `pending_outcome` contract and lets the flywheel resolver measure ground truth — the journal's subjective capture is the fallback for unmeasurable life decisions, which is most of them.

### 2.5 Calibration record

Computed, not stored: the journal view aggregates resolved decisions into a per-domain calibration strip — stated confidence buckets vs realized `better/as_expected/worse` rates, count-honest ("7 decisions — too few to mean much" below n=10). One optional ambient hook: when `log_decision` captures a confidence in a domain where the user's calibration is demonstrably skewed (n≥10), the tool echoes it back ("your 80%+ financial calls resolved 'as expected' 40% of the time") — information at the moment of prediction, never a nag. No LLM, no new store; one SQL aggregate over `knowledge.db` decision items.

## 3. Composition Map (what is consumed vs built)

| Ingredient | Source | This plan builds |
|---|---|---|
| Clock trigger + one-shot `at`/`delete_after_run` | substrate §1.2 | nothing — consumes |
| Run-outcome materiality classification + permalinks | substrate §1.3 (AUTO-R2) | ranking consumer only |
| Fencing + injection screen + frozen capability sets | substrate decisions 4/7 | triage-specific capability declaration |
| Delivery contract + `notification_allowed` gate | substrate decision 13; entity_routes.py | digest formatting, reply-grammar inbound |
| Fire→spawn triage/classifier machinery | substrate §3.6 | per-source NL rules UI + digest-scope application |
| `pulse` self-directed matters | substrate AUTO-R19 (Phase 2) | digest renders them as a section — nothing else |
| Budget floor, kill switch | AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS NEW-1 | consultation points in auto-execute path |
| Strict-JSON structured output | AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS NEW-2 | the proposal schema |
| Pending→resolved lesson lifecycle | LEARNING-FLYWHEEL §3.3 (LEARN-R18) | the invocation at decision resolution |
| Inbox stores, fencing, background one-shots | inbox.py / inbox_service.py | collect stage, `inbox-op` action provider |
| Commitments key-prefix + one-shot delivery precedent | memory_service.py L558-651 | `user.approval.` prefix + approval MemoryKind |
| Knowledge native types + ingest queue | knowledge_providers/native, ingest_queue | `decision` type + Passthrough wiring + 3 tools |
| Lessons write path | memory_service `write_lesson` | strict-format invocation only |

---

## 4. Chat Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `log_decision` | `(summary, expectation, confidence, domain?, review_horizon?)` → knowledge item + one-shot review trigger |
| `decision_list` | `(status?, domain?)` — pending/resolved/overdue |
| `decision_resolve` | `(id, outcome, grade)` — manual resolution outside the review card |
| `triage_rules` | `(list \| revoke <id> \| add <pattern> <verdict>)` — the approval-memory management surface; every rule shows hit_count + created_from provenance |
| `triage_run` | manual digest fire (bypasses min-interval per substrate manual semantics; never budget floors) |

All tools route over HTTP with session-key checks like `mcp_memory.py` does — restricted sessions (temporary) get memory-side reads/writes blocked per the existing gates; incognito blocks the rule writes.

---

## 5. FE Surfaces

1. **Digest card** (inbox + dashboard notification): auto-done section with undo, pending proposals with tier badges + one-tap yes/no/always, "what your machine did" ledger section with permalinks, statusUrl into the run journal. Strictly read-only on view; acting is explicit (the substrate's runs-inbox rule).
2. **Triage rules manager** (one settings card under Inbox settings, per the dual-writer rule: rows are `created_by: system:triage`, edit-locked on the Automations page, managed here): pattern, verdict, scope, hit count, expiry, revoke; the send-capable graduation toggle with warning badge.
3. **Decision Journal view** (a filtered knowledge view, not a new nav section — decisions ARE knowledge items): pending (with horizon countdown + overdue flag), resolved (expectation vs outcome side-by-side, linked lesson chip), the per-domain calibration strip.
4. **Template pack card** ("Morning triage") on the substrate's templates surface — install → editable trigger + per-source classifier rules form.

---

## 6. What We Deliberately Do NOT Build

- **No second pulse engine** — AUTO-R19 owns self-directed proactivity; this plan's digest is the scheduled, user-owned half of the Memoh split and later *presents* pulse matters.
- **No LLM interpretation of approval replies** — the grammar is deterministic; ambiguity gets a help line, not a guess.
- **No auto-send tier by default** — external sends are drafts until a rule is explicitly graduated.
- **No new inbox source providers** — that's WATCHED-SOURCES; the collect stage codes against the existing `MessageSourceProvider` ABC.
- **No decision-journal markdown file store** — the research shape's *lifecycle* survives; the storage is the knowledge store where user items belong.
- **No FK between knowledge items and memory rows** — soft string references only; the two subsystems stay structurally separate (recon-verified invariant, kept).
- **No calibration gamification** — one honest strip, count-caveated; this is a mirror, not a score.

---

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Injected inbox content steering proposals | fenced input + strict schema (NEW-2) + tier clamp by action class + frozen action set + exact-ordinal-id contract; adversarial test in success criteria |
| Auto-execution doing harm | quadruple bound (§1.6): NEW-1 budgets, reversible-only trivial class, per-run cap, named-rule ledger rows + undo; kill switch inherited |
| Approval rules over-generalizing | pattern keys are narrow (action_type + one qualifier); most-specific-match wins; deny beats approve; hit-count + expiry surface stale rules; one-click revoke |
| Reply grammar acting on the wrong digest | stable event-id per digest + ordinals scoped to one digest run; replies against an expired digest get "that digest expired" not best-effort execution |
| Digest fatigue | classifier gate + suppression cooldowns + materiality ranking + quiet-hours gate; empty windows short-circuit to no delivery |
| Horizon reminders nagging | one fire per horizon (trigger self-deletes), 2-deferral cap, stale-pending is a view state not a notification |
| Memory/knowledge conflation creeping in | boundary stated per artifact (§1.4, §2 preamble); review checklist item: no code path writes the other store |
| Coupling to unshipped substrate | plan is staged behind substrate steps 1-5; session 1 (approval memory + config) has no substrate dependency and can land early |

## Provider & Config Plug-in Map

Where each new piece plugs into the pluggable-provider architecture — nothing invents a parallel path:

- **`inbox-op` action provider**: implements `ActionProvider` (action_providers/base.py), registered via `register_action_provider` in `_ensure_default_providers_registered` (or app-delivered later via `provider: {type: "action"}` per the webhook-action precedent), **name added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555)**, settings schema via an `inbox-op-action` extension manifest. Reaches `InboxStore`/source providers through `ActionServices` (action_providers/services.py) like other native providers.
- **`decision` knowledge type**: extends `NATIVE_TYPES` in `knowledge_providers/native/__init__.py` + a Passthrough mapping in `knowledge/pipeline/graphs.py`; creation only via `store.create_typed_item(provider="native")` + `ingest_queue.enqueue` — the uber-pool rule. Future external knowledge providers (Drive, Photos) are orthogonal; decisions are native items.
- **`approval` MemoryKind**: `user.approval.` prefix added to `_kind_from_key` (memory_record.py L310) + `_NON_FACT_KEY_CLAUSE` (vector_memory.py L383); writes through `MemoryService` guarded paths; the prefix is inside the builtin `user.*` allowlist so no `memory.semantic_keys` config change is needed.
- **Templates**: "Morning triage" + "decision-review" ship as bundled WorkflowDefs with pre-attached triggers on the substrate's template surface; triggers minted with deterministic `system:` ids for idempotent re-registration.
- **Background LLM**: classifier gate + proposal stage resolve via `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` / the reasoning axis in `active_models.json` — never the chat axis; new prompts registered as use-case prompts beside `inbox_digest` (`render_use_case_prompt("triage_classify" | "triage_propose")`).
- **New config = a `ProactiveConfig` section**, wired through the FOUR points (recon persistence-security gotcha #1): (a) dataclass fields with `_meta(label, help)` — `triage_enabled` (default false), `digest_schedule`, `auto_execute_enabled` (default false), `max_auto_actions_per_run` (5), `classifier_gate_enabled`, `decision_default_horizon_days` (90); (b) `AppConfig.load()` explicit field-by-field mapping; (c) `to_dict()` new top-level section; (d) `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist + FE for the runtime-editable ones.
- **Delivery**: exclusively `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()`; channel formatting via registered `ChannelTransportProvider`s; redaction before every surface, as heartbeat delivery does today.
- **SEL**: auto-executions, rule creations/revocations, and send-capability graduations audit to `sel.py` like skill installs and egress do.

---

## Implementation Effort

**~5 sessions** (after substrate steps 1-5 are available; session 1 is independently landable):

- **Session 1 — Approval memory + config**: `user.approval.` prefix + `approval` kind + non-fact exclusion; deterministic rule matcher (most-specific, deny-wins); reply grammar parser (pure function, exhaustively unit-tested); suppression cooldowns; `ProactiveConfig` four-point wiring; `triage_rules` tool.
- **Session 2 — Triage pipeline**: collect node (inbox + channels + ledger, ordinal manifest); classifier gate over the substrate triage machinery + per-source NL rules; strict-JSON proposal stage (NEW-2 schema, tier clamp, exact-id contract); ranking off ledger outcomes; digest formatting + delivery contract; "Morning triage" template.
- **Session 3 — Auto-execution + `inbox-op`**: the action provider (registry + ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS + manifest); NEW-1 budget consultation + per-run cap + undo; auto-done ledger rows; adversarial injection tests (success criteria 2/3).
- **Session 4 — Decision journal core**: `decision` native type + Passthrough graph + metadata schema; `log_decision`/`decision_list`/`decision_resolve` tools; horizon one-shot triggers (deterministic ids, reschedule/retire); `decision-review` WorkflowDef + outcome-capture dialogue; R18 lesson invocation + soft back-reference.
- **Session 5 — FE + validation**: digest card (undo, one-tap replies, tier badges); rules manager card; journal view + calibration strip; template pack cards; end-to-end as-a-user validation of both flows incl. quiet-hours, restart, and revocation paths.

## Success Criteria

1. Installing "Morning triage" and sleeping through one cycle produces exactly one digest (quiet-hours deferred to morning), ranked with material items first, with a statusUrl that opens the run journal.
2. An inbox item containing prompt-injection text cannot cause any action outside the trigger's frozen capability set, cannot self-assign `trivial`, and cannot reference an item id absent from the collect manifest — verified adversarially.
3. Replying `always no 4` executes nothing, persists a `user.approval.` deny rule visible in the rules manager with provenance, and the matching item class is silently skipped (with a `skipped_gate` ledger row naming the rule) in the next digest; revoking the rule restores proposals.
4. A trivial-tier archive auto-executes under budget, appears in the auto-done section, and undo restores the item; when the NEW-1 daily budget is exhausted mid-run, remaining trivial proposals demote to pending with `skipped_budget` rows — zero silent drops.
5. `log_decision` in chat creates a knowledge item (`decision` type, searchable, @-pickable) and exactly one one-shot trigger; at horizon a review card lands in the inbox once, the outcome dialogue resolves the item, and a `lesson.*` memory row exists citing the stated expectation vs the captured outcome — with the knowledge item and the memory row linked only by soft references.
6. `too_early` defers at most twice, then the item shows as stale-pending in the journal view with no further notifications.
7. The calibration strip renders per-domain confidence-vs-outcome honestly (count caveat under n=10) from knowledge.db alone — no new store, no LLM call.
8. Nothing in the triage or journal code paths writes to the other store: grep-level audit shows knowledge writes only in §2 paths, memory writes only in §1.4 rules + §2.4 lessons.
9. Kill the gateway between digest delivery and a reply: the reply still acts (stable event-id, idempotent ack) or refuses with "digest expired" — never a wrong-target execution.
10. Disabling `proactive.triage_enabled` retires the system triggers and the rules manager renders rules as dormant-but-kept; re-enabling is lossless.

## Execution log — `PA-2` (Triage pipeline: §1.1 collect → §1.2 classifier gate → §1.3 tiered strict-JSON proposals → §1.5 rank + deliver + the "Morning triage" template) — **PARTIAL**

- [2026-08-25][PA-2] **DONE (4 of 4 done_when clauses MET), one §1.2 prose sub-clause deferred.**
  Ships `proactive/{manifest,collect,gate,proposals,rank,pipeline}.py`, the `triage-digest` action
  provider, the bundled `morning-triage` WorkflowDef, two use-case prompts
  (`triage_classify`/`triage_propose`), two ledger kinds and 62 tests
  (`tests/test_proactive_triage.py`).
  **Clause 1 (collect → stable ordinal manifest):** three lanes (inbox rows in
  `pending`/`seen`; `channel:` sessions whose last turn is not the assistant's; recent runs
  weighted by their OWN `effect` rows, so no run instrumentation is added). Ordinals are assigned
  after a deterministic sort, so two collects over one window mint the same ids — without that, a
  re-collect after a restart renumbers the window and `3 yes` acts on a different item, which is
  criterion 9's wrong-target execution reached with no adversary. Dedup is by provenance
  fingerprint, not rendered text.
  **Clause 2 (the gate drops/surfaces; zero-item windows short-circuit):** `drop` removes the item
  from the digest *and* from the proposal stage's id space; `surface` keeps it visible but
  unproposable. Four spend guards: empty window ⇒ zero calls and NO delivery; no applicable rule
  or the switch off ⇒ no gate call; nothing survived the gate ⇒ no proposal call (the digest still
  renders, for free, so the user sees the filter worked); and exactly ONE proposal call, ever.
  The gate fails **OPEN** (unparseable output, an unknown verdict token, an unmentioned item all
  resolve to `propose`) — the opposite direction from §1.3, and the same split PA-1 recorded for
  `ProactiveConfig`.
  **Clause 3 (ONE strict-JSON call, ≤8, tier-clamped, exact ordinals):** `parse_proposals`
  enforces every constraint in Python regardless of provider, because `output_type` only reaches
  providers that advertise native schema enforcement (`_enforces_json_schema_natively`);
  `proposal_schema()` emits the `additionalProperties: false` + `item_id` enum form for those that
  do. The tier clamp only ever RAISES: external reach (`reply_draft`) floors at `medium`,
  destructive (`dismiss`) at `high`, an unknown action at `high`, while `archive`/`mute_thread`
  stay `trivial`-capable per §1.6's reversibility argument. Fail CLOSED with no retry loop.
  **Clause 4 (materiality-ranked digest, notify gate, one normal WorkflowRun):** ranking is
  `MATERIALITY_ORDER` (AUTO-R2) and nothing else; the body is assembled deterministically from
  typed fields — never a second model call over fenced content; delivery rides
  `triggers.delivery.Delivery.to_notify_kwargs()` into `DashboardState.notify` at `info`, so
  `notification_allowed()`'s quiet-hours branch defers a morning digest (criterion 1) while the
  notification carries a `statusUrl` deep-linking THIS run's journal and an `event_id` DERIVED
  from `(trigger_id, run_id)` — railed both ways, so a re-delivery dedupes rather than arriving
  twice (criterion 9's substrate). The run is the bundled template's own WorkflowRun.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] DEVIATION: **§1.2's per-source NL filter rules live in the template node's
  `action_config`, not in a new store.** The plan does not say where they live; a bundled template
  is copied into the user's `defs/` on instantiate, so the rules end up editable exactly where the
  schedule and the capability set already are, versioned by the engine. A parallel rules store
  would be a second thing to back up and a second place "why was this dropped?" has to be looked
  up. PA-5's §5.2 rules manager can render them from the installed def.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] DEVIATION: **the pipeline is an `action` node, not a chain of `infer` nodes.**
  Same reasoning `selfqa-triage` recorded: the zero-item short-circuit must happen before a model
  is reachable, the ordinal contract must be *enforced* rather than requested, and the drop /
  refusal rationales must be *recorded* (`journal.step_skipped` carries no reason).
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] DEVIATION: **`GateVerdict` was renamed `GateDisposition`.** The
  `structural-duplication` gate counted it as a 24th verdict-shaped type outside
  `judge_contract.py` (`verdict-type:GateVerdict`, 0 → 1). A routing disposition over an attention
  item is not a judgment of produced work, so merging into `JudgeVerdict` would be wrong; the
  family's own rationale sanctions the alternative — "it should not be NAMED a verdict, and that
  rename shrinks this number too". Renamed through the type, the field and the wire key, so the
  concept is not called a verdict anywhere. `gate_report.py`: 6/6 PASS.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] DEFERRED (§1.2 prose, NOT a `done_when` clause): **the cross-run
  fingerprint-keyed gate-decision cache.** A persisted decision cache is a new store — state-shape
  work whose cost only grows — and no `done_when` clause needs it; the short-circuit clause is
  satisfied by the precondition guard, which is measurably free. The fingerprint it would key on
  already exists (`CollectedItem.fingerprint`, asserted stable across a re-render), so this is one
  module later, not a redesign.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] NOT IN SCOPE (correctly PA-3/PA-5): nothing is auto-executed and no approval
  rule is consulted — §1.4's routing table and §1.6's budget floor are PA-3, the digest card is
  PA-5. The pipeline's output is proposals plus a delivered digest; PA-1's `match_rules` is
  deliberately NOT called yet, because the thing it routes (an execution) does not exist here.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] SHARED-FILE TOUCHES (each one line or one block, each required for the atom
  not to be inert): `action_providers/registry.py` (register), `validation.py`
  (`ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`), `triggers/screen.py` (`WRITE_CAPABLE_PROVIDERS` — it spends and
  delivers unattended), `ledger/kinds.py` (`skipped_triage`, `proposal_refused`, both into
  `LEDGER_KINDS` so `read_events` can see them), `guardrails/audit.py` (`CALLERS` gained
  `triage_gate` + `triage_propose` — two values, not one, so a spend audit can tell the cheap call
  from the expensive one), `prompt_providers/catalog.py` (two `BundledPrompt` rows),
  `tests/test_workflows_bundled.py` (the `EXPECTED` template-set ratchet). `decisions.py` was NOT
  touched: PA-4's decision journal is a separate seam and this atom's criterion does not reach it.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] FALSIFICATION: mutated the live refusal path in `apply_gate` —
  `dropped.append(item)` → `proposable.append(item)`, i.e. a gate that admits everything —
  confirmed the mutation by grepping the two lines back, and observed **6 reds**: the drop rail,
  the digest-body-absence rail, the fail-open unmentioned-item count, the id-space narrowing, the
  `skipped_triage` ledger row, and the "a gate-emptied window makes no proposal call" spend guard.
  Restored from a file copy and re-greped. The rail's vacuity floor is `_FIXTURE_SIZE = 3`, the
  literal size of the test fixture, asserted directly — so a gate that dropped nothing (both legs
  equal) and one that dropped everything (both legs zero) each fail, which a floor read off
  `manifest.counts()` could not achieve.
- [2026-08-25][PA-2] Gate: `make lint` green (black/isort/flake8/mypy, 1019 source files),
  `python scripts/gate_report.py` **6/6 PASS**, targeted **604 passed / 0 failed** across
  `test_proactive_triage` (62 new) + the twelve gates a new registered surface drifts —
  `test_workflows_bundled`, `test_triggers_capability_fence`, `test_action_provider_chokepoints`,
  `test_ledger_golden`, `test_agent_reference` (reference regen produced NO drift: an action
  provider is not something `render_reference()` enumerates), `test_config_roundtrip`,
  `test_proactive_approval`, `test_prompt_use_cases`, `test_prompts`,
  `test_native_hook_providers`, `test_triggers_delivery`. Real-home rail clean; probe sweep 16
  total / 0 diff-introduced; tree clean, one signed-off commit.

## Execution log — `PA-3` (§1.6 trivial-tier auto-execution + the `inbox-op` action provider) — **DONE**

- [2026-08-25][PA-3] DONE. Every done_when clause is met. Recon first: `git grep -n "inbox-op"` on
  `main` @`5283468b` found the name only in COMMENTS (`triggers/screen.py:469` and the plan), so
  this was genuinely unbuilt. `proactive.max_auto_actions_per_run` was **already wired end to end**
  by PA-1 (`config/loader.py:3753` + validation at `:3784` + the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH
  allowlist), so **no config work was needed and none was done** — `loader.py` sits at 5900/6000
  with headroom exactly 100 against a `>=100` rail, so a new field there would have reddened
  `structural-size` with nothing left to compress.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] `inbox-op` is `action_providers/inbox_op_provider.py`: five ops (`archive`,
  `mark_read`, `mute_thread`, `dismiss`, `reply_draft`), every one REVERSIBLE, because §1.6 makes
  reversibility the definition of the trivial-capable class. The undo rides the platform's existing
  `ActionResult.reversal` / `ActionProvider.reverse` contract (AG §5.2/§6.1) rather than a private
  one, so `guardrails.ladder.reverse_action` resolves an inbox undo through the same path it
  resolves a task undo. The handle is base64 rather than colon-joined: two of the three things it
  carries — an item id (`{channel}_{ts}`) and a previous draft (free text) — cannot be delimited by
  any character reserved in the handle grammar. `reverse` refuses when the item MOVED ON since
  (asserted, with its own vacuity sibling), because a reversal that clobbers a newer change takes
  away the user's undo AND their evidence in one call.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] **`reply_draft` has no send path at all**, and that is asserted by a source
  scan for `send_reply`/`add_reaction`/`send_message` in the provider module — §1.6 bound 2
  enforced in the code that performs the action rather than trusted to whoever calls it. A user's
  own always-approve rule for `reply_draft` therefore still produces a draft; the graduation toggle
  PA-5 renders can only ever point at a different, send-capable provider.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] The stage is `proactive/autoexec.py`, and it runs BETWEEN stage 3 and stage 4,
  not after delivery. `run_triage` gained an injected `auto_execute` hook and passes only the
  LEFTOVERS to `render_digest`; `render_digest` gained `auto_lines`, rendered first inside the
  existing "What your machine did" heading. Ordering it after `deliver` would have produced a
  digest that offered the user a proposal for work the machine had already done seconds earlier —
  the one thing a digest cannot get wrong. Pinned by a rail: mutating `pending = auto.pending` back
  to `batch.proposals` reds on `assert 'Needs you:' not in ...`.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] 🔴 **FINDING — the first draft had §1.6's four bounds and NONE of the
  platform's two.** `test_action_provider_chokepoints.test_the_site_list_is_not_STALE` caught it:
  this module is a FIFTH unattended dispatch seam (AG §1.2) and was reaching a provider with no
  policy check, so a digest would have kept archiving through an incident and past the operator's
  denylist. Fixed by adding `incident_active()` (before the loop, fail-closed, everything deferred
  with a reason so an incident reads as a deferral and not as a digest that went silent) and
  `enforce_action(provider, config, ctx, session_key=…)` (per action, before dispatch). Both live
  in `auto_execute` itself, NOT in `_default_dispatch`: a gate inside the default dispatch is
  bypassed by any caller that supplies its own, which is the exact shape of a seam that loses a
  control. `DispatchFn` grew a `ctx` parameter so the gate screens the SAME context object the
  provider executes against. `EXECUTION_SITES` + `DENYLIST_SEAMS` both gained the module.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] DEVIATION (deliberate, documented in the module docstring): **the budget check
  fails CLOSED here, opposite to `triggers/screen.py`'s fail-OPEN.** That gate decides whether a
  trigger FIRES AT ALL, where a hung probe stopping every automation would be the worse outage.
  This gate decides whether an unattended WRITE happens, and its fallback is not an outage — the
  proposal queues pending, exactly where it would have been anyway. Nothing is lost by refusing.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] The ledger row carries the matched rule's key, and a trivial-tier execution
  with no taught rule behind it records `policy:trivial-tier` rather than an empty string: an empty
  `rule` reads as a taught rule whose key went missing. `auto_executed` + `skipped_budget` joined
  `LEDGER_KINDS` (a kind outside that set is written and then invisible to `read_events`). The
  deferral reason and the ledger kind are the SAME token for a breach, asserted, so a user counting
  breaches does not have to know which surface to trust.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] 🔴 **FINDING — `structural-import-direction` caught a core→HTTP edge** that a
  green build and green tests both missed: the provider's websocket push needs the redaction pass
  every other writer of `inbox_item_updated` runs, and that lived in
  `dashboard/handlers_inbox._redact_item`. Fixed by INVERTING the dependency as the gate asks —
  `_redact_item` moved DOWN to `inbox.redact_item` and `handlers_inbox._redact_item` is now a plain
  alias, so there is exactly one implementation. Re-implementing it in the provider would have been
  the R18 duplicate that eventually diverges on the next redaction rule. `inbox.live_state` was
  added beside the existing `live_store` for the two sets that live beside the items
  (`dismissed`/`muted_threads`), isinstance-checked for the same reason: a `MagicMock()` state
  answers every getattr, so an attribute check alone would route real writes into a fake.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] Criterion 2 (adversarial injection) is driven through the REAL parser and the
  REAL stage from a model reply that is exactly what a jailbroken item produces — four attacks in
  one payload: self-assign `trivial` for `dismiss`, self-assign `trivial` for `reply_draft`, invent
  an action outside `ACTION_TYPES`, and name an ordinal the manifest never minted. Result: two
  refused at the parse boundary, two clamped UP (`high`/`medium`), **zero dispatches**. Hand-built
  `Proposal`s were deliberately not used — a hand-built proposal has already passed the clamp the
  attack is trying to skip. Its vacuity sibling runs the same window without the injection and
  requires one dispatch, so "nothing ran" cannot be satisfied by a stage that never runs anything.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] SHARED-FILE TOUCHES: `action_providers/registry.py` (register),
  `validation.py` (`ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`), `triggers/screen.py` (`WRITE_CAPABLE_PROVIDERS` —
  reversible is not read-only), `guardrails/rungs.py` (`action.inbox_op`, floor AND ceiling
  `auto_with_undo`: `autonomous` would let an accumulated track record take the undo offer away,
  and §1.6's whole reversibility argument dies with it), `ledger/kinds.py` (two kinds + both into
  `LEDGER_KINDS`), `apps/native/inbox-op-action/app.json` (the settings-schema manifest; its `op`
  enum IS the provider's op set, asserted), `reference/{index,providers}.md` (regenerated — one
  added line + one count, unlike PA-2 which produced no drift because it shipped no native app),
  `inbox.py`, `dashboard/handlers_inbox.py`, `proactive/{pipeline,rank}.py`,
  `tests/test_action_provider_chokepoints.py`.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] FALSIFICATION, three mutations, each grep-confirmed applied and each restored
  from a `/tmp` file copy (never `git checkout`): (1) `breached = False` after the budget check →
  **1 red** (`assert 3 == 1` on the breach clause); (2) `auto_execute=None` at the provider call
  site → **2 reds** (the wiring rail and the end-to-end archive); (3) `pending = batch.proposals`
  in the pipeline → **1 red** (`'Needs you:' not in body`). The rails' vacuity floor is
  `_EXPECTED_UNDER_BUDGET = 3`, the literal inbox-lane size of the fixture asserted directly, so a
  stage that dispatched nothing (both legs zero) fails rather than passes.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] Gate: `make lint` green (black 2084 files / isort / flake8 / mypy 1026 source
  files), `python scripts/gate_report.py` **6/6 PASS** (after the import-direction fix above),
  targeted **931 passed / 1 failed / 1 skipped** across 21 suites. The one red is
  `test_guardrails_ladder::test_create_task_deletes_the_row_it_filed` — PRE-EXISTING and unrelated:
  it passes alone (`-n0`, and under xdist with this branch's changes present) and fails identically
  on `main` @`5283468b` in the same multi-file batch, so it is the known xdist
  `_isolated_home`-leak family, not a `create-task` regression. Real-home rail clean on every run;
  probe sweep 16 total / 0 diff-introduced; tree clean, one signed-off commit.
- [2026-08-25][PA-3] NOT in scope, deliberately: the digest CARD (auto-done section with the undo
  button, tier badges, the rules manager) is `PA-5`. The stage already emits everything that card
  needs — `summary()` carries `auto_executed` (with the reversal handle), `auto_deferred` (with the
  closed-vocabulary reason) and `budget_breached` — so PA-5 renders, it does not re-derive.
