# DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/DCU.md`](../atomic/DCU.md) as 7 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Desktop Computer Use — Native GUI Automation via the Accessibility Tree

**Status:** DESIGNED — created 2026-08-05. An accessibility-tree-driven GUI automation design
(~13k LOC of new capability). This plan covers **desktop application automation**, which no existing
plan owns: BROWSE-AUTOMATION (#…) is deliberately browser-only.

**Created:** 2026-08-05
**Wave:** 3 — a large, security-heavy capability. **Hard-gated on AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS** (the safety
floor + a keystone enable) and on PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1 (resource ceilings on the driver
subprocess).
**Depends on:** AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS (safety profiles, SEL audit, egress irrelevant here but the
approval ladder applies), PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1 (the driver runs as a ceilinged spawn),
SECURITY-HARDENING (this is a class-B/S capability that touches the OS input layer).

**Scope:** let the agent **read and drive the operator's own desktop applications** through the OS
accessibility layer — enumerate on-screen apps, walk one app's window into an indexed accessibility
tree, then act on an element **by index** (press, type, set value, scroll, named action), with a
coordinate path reserved for canvas/custom-drawn UI. macOS first; Windows/Linux report a typed
refusal until their drivers land. **Soul guardrail:** element-targeted, non-pointer input is the
DEFAULT and the only thing on by default; the real cursor never moves *by accident*; the whole
capability is OFF until the operator turns it on out-of-band in a file the agent can neither read
nor write. This is a power tool with a physical-world blast radius — every default is the safe one.

---

## 1. Why this is a separate plan, and why the accessibility-tree approach

**BROWSE-AUTOMATION is browser-only** (a `browse` action provider over headless Chromium). Driving
the operator's *desktop* apps — Mail, a native IDE, a design tool — is a different substrate: it
speaks to the OS accessibility API, not a DOM. Verified: no Gideon plan mentions accessibility/
AXPress/desktop-automation (grep across all 67 plans, zero hits). So this is genuinely new capability.

**The approach (validated against the open `open-codex-computer-use` MCP contract):** act on an
**indexed accessibility element**, not on screen coordinates. `computer_click` with an `element_index`
performs an `AXPress` — it activates a control with **no pointer involved at all**. This is
dramatically safer and more reliable than screenshot-and-coordinate clicking (which breaks on
theme/resolution/layout shifts and warps the physical cursor). Coordinate clicking + drag exist only
for UI that exposes no addressable element (canvases, maps), and even those post a *located* event to
the target process (`CGEventPostToPid`) rather than moving the cursor. The one path that warps the
real cursor (`click_method: "global"`) must be **named explicitly by the model** — `auto` never
resolves onto it — and emits its own SEL record.

---

## 2. Architecture (thin shim, in-gateway dispatch)

Separate the OS driver from the shim, matching Gideon's MCP-tool conventions:

```
agent (ACP)
  └─ spawns  gideon mcp-computer          (stdio MCP server)
       │      THIN SHIM — resolves session identity strictly, forwards, returns text
       ▼
  gateway dispatch (the real work; the shim holds no OS handles)
       1. enable_state.is_enabled()          keystone primary enable (out-of-band file)
       2. policy.check_app                    target policy (self + operator allowlists)
       3. index freshness (TTL) + fingerprint re-walk
       4. policy.check_input_target           secure-field / sensitive-text screen
       5. gate.require_computer_use           SEL audit (records, does not decide)
       6. platform driver (macOS AX / Windows UIA / Linux AT-SPI)
       7. re-snapshot, redact_result
```

**Why the shim is thin and the work is in-gateway:** the OS driver needs the gateway's policy,
enable-state, and SEL — replicating those in a subprocess would fork the security surface. The shim
resolves session identity and forwards; it holds no OS handles. This is the same reasoning as
Gideon's other MCP tools that dispatch back into the gateway.

**The tool surface** (element-index discipline per turn): `computer_list_apps`, `computer_snapshot`
(walk a window → indexed AX tree), `computer_click` (element_index → AXPress; or a named coordinate
method), `computer_type`, `computer_set_value`, `computer_scroll`, `computer_perform_action` (a
named AX action). Every snapshot has a TTL + fingerprint so a stale index can't act on a moved
element.

---

## 3. The security floors (non-negotiable — this touches the OS input layer)

1. **Keystone primary enable, out-of-band.** OFF until the operator writes an enable file the agent
   can neither read nor write (not a config field the agent can PATCH). No prompt, no tool, no chat
   instruction can flip it. This is the single hardest gate and it is first in the dispatch chain.
2. **Element-index default, pointer never moves by accident.** `auto` resolves to `AXPress` whenever
   an element index is present. Coordinate/global paths must be explicitly named by the model and
   each emits a distinct SEL `tool_kind`.
3. **Target policy** (`policy.check_app`): a self-plus-operator allowlist of which apps may be
   driven; everything else refused. Secure/password fields and sensitive text screened
   (`check_input_target`) before any type/set-value.
4. **Every action is SEL-audited** (`gate.require_computer_use` records, doesn't decide) and subject
   to the AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS approval ladder — an unattended profile cannot drive the desktop unless
   the operator granted it at creation time.
5. **Runs as a ceilinged spawn** (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1 `tool` profile) — a wedged/looping
   driver is bounded by the kernel, not just a userspace timeout.
6. **Honest platform story:** macOS first (AX API). Windows (UIA) and Linux (AT-SPI) report a typed
   refusal until their drivers land — never a silent no-op or a simulated success.
7. **The human-facing views grant nothing:** an optional live-view (PiP) mirrors screenshots the
   model already read; an optional cursor-motion overlay draws a *fake* cursor so a watching human
   sees where a click will land — it is not the real pointer and is invisible to screen capture.

## 4. Sessions (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — macOS driver + the safety floor (the whole gate before any capability)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| DCU1.1 | Keystone enable-state: an out-of-band enable file + `enable_state.is_enabled()`; the agent has no read/write path to it; a config field cannot substitute | `src/gideon/computer_use/enable_state.py` (new pkg) | with the file absent, every tool refuses with a WHAT/WHY/FIX pointer to the enable step; no tool/config flips it |
| DCU1.2 | `policy.py` (target-app allowlist + `check_input_target` secure-field screen) + `gate.py` (SEL audit, no decision) | `computer_use/policy.py`, `gate.py` | driving a non-allowlisted app refuses; typing into a secure field refuses; every attempt (allowed or refused) has a SEL record |
| DCU1.3 | macOS AX driver (element walk → indexed tree with TTL+fingerprint; `AXPress`; type/set/scroll/named-action; located coordinate path via `CGEventPostToPid`; the explicit `global` warp behind its own name+SEL) via ctypes FFI | `computer_use/macos_driver.py`, `macos_ffi.py`, `types.py` | on macOS with the enable on, snapshot a TextEdit window, `AXPress` a button by index, type into a field — pointer does not move; a stale index (post-TTL) refuses and forces re-snapshot |
| DCU1.4 | The thin stdio shim + in-gateway dispatch + the tool surface registered; ceilinged spawn (PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS §1 `tool` profile) | `computer_use/cli.py`, `service.py`, `tools.py`, MCP registration | the agent lists apps and clicks an element end-to-end; the shim holds no OS handles; the driver spawn carries the ceiling |
| V1 | Validation (macOS, enable ON): drive a real app by element index; confirm the pointer stays put; confirm a secure-field refusal; confirm SEL records; confirm the enable file being absent blocks everything | — | holds; recorded |

### Session 2 — Human-facing views + Windows/Linux refusal + approval integration

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| DCU2.1 | Optional live-view (PiP) mirroring already-read screenshots + optional cursor-motion overlay (fake cursor, invisible to capture); both grant the agent nothing | `computer_use/overlay*.py`, `render.py`, a dashboard view | the views render; neither adds any agent capability (assert the tool surface is unchanged with views on) |
| DCU2.2 | AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS approval-ladder integration: an unattended profile drives the desktop only with a creation-time grant; interactive sessions get the approval prompt | `computer_use/policy.py`, guardrails seam | an unattended run without the grant refuses + notifies; an interactive run prompts |
| DCU2.3 | Windows (UIA) + Linux (AT-SPI) typed refusals with a clear "not yet on this platform" message (driver stubs that refuse honestly, not silently) | `computer_use/windows_driver.py`, `linux_driver.py` | on non-macOS, every tool returns a typed refusal naming the platform; no silent no-op |
| V2 | Validation: views on/off change no capability; unattended-without-grant refuses; a non-macOS run refuses honestly | — | holds |

**Windows/Linux real drivers** are a deliberate later split (their own sessions when the owner has
the platforms to validate on) — Session 1–2 ship macOS + honest refusals, per PLATFORM-REACH ordering.

---

## Owner tasks (real world)

- **Decide the enable-file location + shape** — it must be somewhere the agent process genuinely
  cannot reach (not under a config dir the agent can PATCH). This is the load-bearing gate.
- **Confirm macOS-first is acceptable** for v1 with honest Windows/Linux refusals (matches
  PLATFORM-REACH's ordering).

## Risks & open questions

- **This is the highest physical-world blast radius in the whole roadmap.** An agent that can drive
  the desktop can, in principle, do anything the operator can. The keystone enable + element-index
  default + target allowlist + SEL + the approval ladder are all load-bearing — none is optional, and
  the plan is structured so the *entire* safety floor lands in Session 1 before any capability is
  usable.
- **Accessibility APIs are OS-permission-gated** (macOS Accessibility permission). The enable flow
  must guide the operator through granting it and refuse legibly when it's missing — never a hang.
- **Element-index staleness** is the correctness risk: acting on a moved element. The TTL+fingerprint
  re-walk is the mitigation; validate it explicitly (DCU1.3 done-when).

## Execution log

<!-- Append only: - [YYYY-MM-DD][T<id>] DEVIATION|DISCOVERY|DONE|BLOCKED: <one line> -->

- [2026-08-05][plan] Created. Routed here (not into BROWSE-AUTOMATION) because that plan is
  browser-only by soul; desktop GUI automation is a distinct substrate (OS accessibility tree, not a
  DOM). The accessibility-tree / element-index approach is adopted over screenshot-and-coordinate
  because it is safer (no pointer motion), more reliable (survives theme/layout shifts), and its
  safety model (keystone enable, element-default, target allowlist) is proven sound.

- [2026-08-15][DCU-1] DONE: keystone out-of-band enable-state shipped as
  `src/gideon/computer_use/enable_state.py`, built on `guardrails/ceiling.py`'s trust model
  instead of a second one. The enable document lives at
  `$GIDEON_HOME/governance/computer_use.enable.json` — deliberately the directory the
  governance ceiling already owns, so the keystone and the ceiling share ONE trust root and ONE
  sensitive-path denylist entry (`security.py` needed no change) — and is overridable to an absolute
  path by `GIDEON_COMPUTER_USE_ENABLE_FILE` so an operator can put it on a root-owned `0444`
  file outside the agent's home. Required content: exactly `{"version": 1, "enabled": true, "apps": ["TextEdit"]}`.
  DISCOVERY: a touch-a-marker file is unsafe here, and it is measurable — as a marker, an empty file
  and a half-flushed write both ARM the machine; as a document with a required positive shape both
  fail closed. Those two cases are now named rows in the fail-closed corpus rather than a claim.
  Fourteen malformed shapes resolve to OFF (non-JSON, wrong root type, unknown version, unknown key,
  `"true"`, `1`, `false`, missing flag); `enabled` is compared with `is True`, never for truthiness.
  An unenforced key is REFUSED rather than ignored, on the ceiling's reasoning: `{"enabled": true,
  "only_apps": ["Mail"]}` means *on, narrowed*, so honouring the flag while dropping the scope would
  grant strictly more than was asked. Read once and cached, so neither a tamper nor a legitimate
  enable widens the running process — arming costs a restart the operator performs and can see.
  `require_enabled(tool)` raises `ComputerUseDisabled` carrying a typed `AgentError`
  (`ERR_COMPUTER_USE_DISABLED`) whose FIX names the resolved path, the exact bytes, the restart and
  the env override; never a falsy return, because a no-op reads to a model as "the click landed".

- [2026-08-15][DCU-1] DISCOVERY: ⚠️ **the computer-use tool population is EMPTY on `main`, so the
  done_when's "every computer-use tool refuses" cannot be exercised over real tools yet.** Verified:
  there was no `computer_use` package at all before this atom; `DCU-4` owns the tool surface, the
  stdio shim and the in-gateway dispatch chain, and `DCU-3` the macOS driver. A test that literally
  iterated the tool set would therefore have passed over nothing. What is armed vs exercised, stated
  plainly: **exercised today** — resolution + fail-closed corpus, the refusal message and its
  WHAT/WHY/FIX shape (through a fixture tool that calls the real guard), the no-config-field and
  no-write-surface proofs, the caching property, and the boot SEL audit. **Armed but unexercised
  until `DCU-4`** — the clause "every computer-use tool", and the atom scope's "first check in the
  dispatch chain" (there is no dispatch chain to be first in). The arming is two rails plus an
  explicit vacuity marker: rail A asserts by AST that every module-level `computer_*` function under
  `computer_use/` calls the guard as its FIRST statement, proven to detect rather than to match
  nothing (the scanner is run against an unguarded twin and against a guard-placed-after-the-work
  variant, and flags both); rail B pins every public function/class in the package, closing rail A's
  stated naming gap so a dispatch surface that abandons the `computer_*` convention still trips
  something; and `test_the_computer_use_tool_population_is_currently_empty` states the size is 0 out
  loud and reds the moment `DCU-4` adds the first tool. Measured on a synthetic future tool: an
  unguarded `computer_*` tool reds 3 tests; a correctly guarded one satisfies rail A and reds only
  the two census tests (so the ratchet is a gate, not "any new function reds"); a non-`computer_*`
  dispatch surface escapes rail A and is caught by rail B.

- [2026-08-15][DCU-1] DEVIATION: added a live call site the atom's file list does not name —
  `gateway.py::GatewayOrchestrator.run` calls `ensure_computer_use_boot()` immediately after
  `ensure_governance_boot()`, resolving the keystone once and SEL-auditing source + digest + outcome
  per run. Reason: without it this atom would ship an inert module, which this repo treats as a
  defect, and the alternative (inventing a dispatch chain to have a caller) is worse — `DCU-4` owns
  that chain. The boot hook is real work today: it fixes the process posture before any service
  exists and is the tamper evidence the precedent (`ceiling.ensure_governance_boot`) exists to
  provide. Unlike governance it NEVER aborts: "no bound" would be a widening, whereas OFF is the
  normal and default state, so a typo in an operator's JSON must not take the gateway down.
  Second, smaller deviation: `ERR_COMPUTER_USE_DISABLED` is registered in `errors.ERROR_CODES`,
  following that module's documented contract ("new failure paths add a code") rather than the
  ceiling's practice — its `ERR_GOVERNANCE_*` codes are raised without being registered.

- [2026-08-15][DCU-1] DISCOVERY (falsification found a real defect, not a test gap): 8 mutations
  were run and every one reded the intended rail — none reded nothing. `is_enabled() -> True`
  unconditionally: **20 tests red**, including `test_the_fixture_tool_refuses_when_the_keystone_is_
  absent` with `Failed: DID NOT RAISE ComputerUseDisabled`. That number is only 20 because the first
  version was wrong: `require_enabled` read `state.enabled` directly, bypassing `is_enabled()`, so
  the same mutation left EVERY refusal test green and reded 18 unrelated assertions instead. Two
  independent readers of one flag is exactly how one ends up answering differently from the other,
  so `require_enabled` now reads the decision through `is_enabled()` — the one check the plan names.
  Fail-open on a parse error (the `JSONDecodeError` branch returning `enabled=True`): 4 red,
  `AssertionError: '' armed the keystone`. An unguarded future `computer_*` tool: 3 red. A
  `computer_use.enabled` entry in `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`: 1 red. Removing the gateway boot call: 1 red.
  A second shipped module naming the env var: 1 red (`... the out-of-band property is gone:
  ['computer_use/enable_state.py', 'dashboard/handlers/core.py']`). Dropping
  `.gideon/governance` from the sensitive-path denylist: 2 red (so that rail is not vacuous).
  A `write_text` inside the keystone module itself: 2 red.

- [2026-08-15][DCU-1] Gate: `make lint` clean (black 1679 files, isort, flake8, mypy 866 sources, no
  issues) · `tests/test_computer_use_enable_state.py` 42 passed · repo-wide rails 129 passed
  (`test_inert_surface_baseline`, `test_portability`, `test_durability_inventory`,
  `test_config_baseline`, `test_resilience_degraded_lint`, `test_api_manifest_drift`,
  `test_error_codes_append_only`, `test_roadmap_dag_derived`) · security-adjacent 397 passed, 9
  xfailed (`tests/security/`, `test_guardrails_ceiling`, `test_security*`, `test_gateway`). The
  real-home rail reported `~/.gideon` unchanged on every run. The inert-surface baseline was
  NOT regenerated and did not need to be: this atom adds no config key, enum member, trigger kind,
  `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` entry or SDK export. No CHANGELOG entry — there is no user-reachable capability
  to announce (no computer-use tool exists to enable, and the only observable change on a default
  install is one boot-time SEL row), so the reasoning is recorded here instead per the atom's
  instruction. DISCOVERY (pre-existing, NOT fixed here — one concern per commit): `governance/` is
  neither claimed nor ignored by the durability inventory, so `audit_home()` would report it
  unclaimed if an operator ever creates it. Measured: `is_ignored('governance')` is False,
  `claim_for('governance')` is None, and no INVENTORY entry is nested under it. It does not red today
  because the directory does not exist on a default install and no test creates one. It arrived with
  the ceiling, not with this atom, and the correct fix is an *ignore* entry (operator-owned
  out-of-band state must not be snapshot-restored — restoring it could re-arm a machine), which
  belongs to whoever owns that inventory row.

- **2026-08-23 — `DCU-2` COMPLETE (all three clauses). Atom stays `todo` only because this code is
  unmerged**; flip it when the PR lands.
  Three clauses, all offline-testable, against `DCU-1`'s shipped keystone: a non-allowlisted app refuses,
  a secure/password destination refuses, and **every** attempt — allowed or refused — leaves a SEL row.
  The OS driver is `DCU-3` and is not touched here.
  **The allowlist lives in the out-of-band enable document, NOT `config.json` — a decision, not a
  convenience.** `DCU-1` built the keystone so *"no tool or config path can flip the state"*. The app
  allowlist is what stands between "computer use is on" and "the agent may drive your password manager", so
  PATCH-editable config would hand an agent with config-write access a route to widen its own reach. Same
  threat, same storage.
  **The `ENABLE_DOCUMENT` tension, resolved rather than deferred.** That constant is quoted verbatim in the
  refusal's FIX line precisely so *"the message a model reads and the bytes this module accepts can never
  drift apart"*. Once `apps` is required, the old two-key document arms a capability that drives nothing —
  an operator would follow the FIX exactly, hit a second refusal, and that one names no further fix, which
  teaches them the message cannot be trusted. So the quoted bytes became
  `{"version": 1, "enabled": true, "apps": ["TextEdit"]}`, one deliberately benign target, and a test runs
  the constant through the real parser and asserts the result can actually drive something. Verified at
  integration rather than taken on report.
  **Absent and explicit `[]` are identical BY CONSTRUCTION** (`data.get("apps", [])`), not by two branches
  — neither can mean "all" without inverting the narrower of the operator's two grants into the widest one.
  `[]` is deliberately not a parse refusal: "armed, targets not chosen yet" is coherent, and reporting it as
  malformed would collapse it with "your JSON has a typo", the distinction `EnableState.detail` exists to
  keep.
  **Name matching is exact byte equality, and every normalisation was rejected with a reason:** case-folding
  reaches a differently-cased app the operator never named (and these names are case-sensitive on the
  platforms this drives), sub/superstring reaches `TextEditPro`, display-name↔bundle-id reaches
  `com.apple.TextEdit`, stripping makes a padded entry start matching. So `parse_enable_document` REFUSES a
  non-list, a non-string entry, an empty or padded entry, and an exact duplicate — naming the offender —
  rather than normalising into something broader. Probed live: padded, duplicate and unknown-key documents
  all read as OFF with an empty allowlist.
  **`policy` decides; `gate` only records.** That split is the plan's, and it is enforced by naming: neither
  module uses the `computer_*` prefix, because that prefix is what the keystone ratchet binds to
  `require_enabled()`, and a second keystone reader inside the chain is exactly the drift
  `require_enabled`'s own docstring was written about (an earlier version read `state.enabled` directly and
  *"forcing `is_enabled` to return True left every refusal test GREEN"*).
  **Unknown means no, per shape.** `check_input_target` screens role/subrole/label/value across both the
  bare and `AX*` spellings, and **every present spelling must pass, not the first found** — a target
  claiming `{"role": "AXTextField", "AXRole": "AXButton"}` refuses, because screening whichever came first
  lets the caller choose which of its two claims gets enforced. A non-mapping, an empty mapping, a missing
  or empty role, a role outside the editable set, a subrole outside the allowed set, or any screened key
  holding a non-string all refuse. Falsified at integration: disabling the role guard reds 4, including the
  contradictory-spellings case and the never-seen-role case.
  **"Sensitive text" reuses the repo's one definition** — `security.redact_credentials`, refusing when it
  warns — rather than minting a second sensitivity vocabulary. The separate label lexicon (`password`,
  `passcode`, `cvv`, `otp`, …) identifies the FIELD, not the content, and exists because the commonest real
  password field is a web-view `AXTextField` titled "Password" with no secure subrole at all. Word-bounded,
  so `Pinned messages` and `Shipping address` do not refuse; the refusal never quotes the value it refused.
  **DEVIATION — no implicit self-allowance.** The plan says "self-plus-operator allowlist"; Gideon
  itself is NOT granted. Driving Gideon's own windows means clicking its own approval dialogs and
  settings — the one target where computer use converts into raising the agent's own permissions. "Self" is
  an ordinary operator-listed entry, and an empty allowlist refuses everything including Gideon. Not
  escalated as E4 because the ambiguity only resolves toward granting MORE, and the strict version ships
  correctly.
  **The audit records and cannot decide.** `require_computer_use` never raises: the whole body is wrapped,
  and a dropped write logs a **WARNING** (a deliberate step up from `DCU-1`'s `logger.debug` on its
  once-per-run boot row — this one is per-attempt, so a broken audit is a silent ONGOING hole) naming the
  tool, outcome and app. A test asserts the level, the content, and that it fires exactly once, so "fails
  open" stays distinguishable from "never ran". `outcome` passes through unvalidated: coercing an
  unrecognised outcome would record a different verdict than happened, and rejecting it would be a decision.
  **`metadata` carries no free text, enforced structurally — and the reason is a real finding about the
  SEL.** `redact_event` protects nothing here: `log()` writes `json.dumps(asdict(event))` to disk
  **unredacted** (verified at `sel.py:339`; redaction runs only on the forward callback at `:344` and the
  read surface), and it recognises credential-shaped strings, not personal data. A window title like
  "Bank of America — Checking" is neither, so it would pass through and live in the audit log forever. So
  strings and containers are replaced **wholesale** with a `<str len=N>` shape — wholesale, not walked, so
  there is no depth at which a string survives and no recursion to get wrong.
  **Four things only the MERGE could resolve, all fixed here.** (1) The public-surface AST ratchet needed
  one combined entry for both new modules — three branches editing one dict literal is the conflict the
  fence exists to prevent, and both agents correctly deferred it. (2) `ERR_COMPUTER_USE_APP_NOT_ALLOWED`
  and `ERR_COMPUTER_USE_SECURE_FIELD` were missing from the append-only `ERROR_CODES` registry the way
  `DCU-1` registered its code; added, and verified by extracting the codes `policy.py` actually names and
  checking every one is registered. (3) The package docstring still said *"the only module here today is
  enable_state"*. (4) **Two owner-maintained docs stated required content the parser no longer accepts** —
  `DESKTOP-COMPUTER-USE.md:172` and `DCU.md:36` both said the file must contain exactly
  `{"version": 1, "enabled": true}`, which after this change arms a capability that can drive nothing.
  **A premise in the briefing was wrong, and the agent was right to override it.** I required `DCU-1`'s
  ratchet to pass untouched as the compatibility proof. It cannot: `DCU-1` deliberately chose `apps` as its
  canonical **unenforced scope key**, with a parametrized case asserting
  `{"version":1,"enabled":true,"apps":["Mail"]}` must refuse with *"does not enforce"*. `DCU-2` enforcing
  `apps` makes that assertion factually false. The case was **re-keyed to `windows`, not deleted**, so the
  case count and the property survive — and a falsification accepting unknown keys still reds it, proving
  the edit left it detecting rather than vacuous.

- **2026-08-24 — `DCU-2` AUDIT: the deliverable IS on `main` (commit `22f28ad6`), so the entry above's
  own condition for flipping — *"stays `todo` only because this code is unmerged"* — is met.** Audited
  rather than rebuilt: a branch carrying the DCU-2 commit rebased onto `main` reported *"dropping … patch
  contents already upstream"*, and `policy.py` (395 lines) + `gate.py` (197 lines) are present with the
  merge-resolution items verified individually — both codes registered in `errors.ERROR_CODES`
  (`errors.py:59`, `:64`) and both modules pinned in the public-surface AST ratchet
  (`test_computer_use_enable_state.py:524-531`). 192 tests green across the four computer-use files.
  **All three clauses hold as MODULE CONTRACTS, proved by driving the real functions, not by reading them.**
  Against a tmp `GIDEON_HOME` with `{"version":1,"enabled":true,"apps":["TextEdit"]}`: `TextEdit`
  allowed, while `Terminal`, `textedit`, `TextEditPro` and `Gideon` all refuse
  `ERR_COMPUTER_USE_APP_NOT_ALLOWED`; an ordinary `AXTextField` and one titled `Pinned messages` are
  allowed, while `AXSecureTextField`, a web-view field titled `Password`, an `AXButton`, contradictory
  `role`/`AXRole` spellings, a target with no role, and a field already holding an API-key-shaped value
  all refuse `ERR_COMPUTER_USE_SECURE_FIELD`. With the enable document ABSENT the allowlist is `()` and
  every app refuses including Gideon — the fail-closed direction needs no exemption.
  **Clause 3 re-proved against a REAL on-disk SEL, because the suite proves it against a fake.**
  `test_computer_use_gate.py` substitutes `gate.SecurityEventLog` with a capturing stand-in, which shows
  `log()` was *called* but not that the row is *writable*. Driving a real `SecurityEventLog` at a tmp
  `base_dir` produced exactly 2 rows in `security_events.jsonl`: the ALLOWED one
  (`operation=computer_click`, `outcome=completed`, `resources=app=TextEdit`, `error=""`) and the REFUSED
  one (`operation=computer_type`, `outcome=denied`, `error=ERR_COMPUTER_USE_APP_NOT_ALLOWED`). The
  metadata leak-proofing holds on a real write: `{"window_title": "Bank of America - Checking"}` landed as
  `{"window_title": "<str len=26>"}`. Real-home rail: `~/.gideon` unchanged.
  **Four falsifications, each mutating the LIVE line and restoring from a file copy (never
  `git checkout --`), md5-verified back to `e07c66a9`/`3e63c00b`:** dropping the allowlist comparison in
  `check_app` reds 15; admitting `AXSecureTextField` into `_ALLOWED_SUBROLES` with `_SECURE_SUBROLES`
  emptied reds 7; repointing `_SECRET_FIELD_TERMS` at a string that matches nothing reds 2 (so the
  web-view-password rail detects rather than merely matching nothing); an early `return` before
  `SecurityEventLog().log(...)` reds 34, **including `test_allowed_attempt_produces_one_sel_row` and
  `test_refused_attempt_produces_one_sel_row_with_the_refusal_code` separately** — the allowed half is
  the one a single "a row exists" assertion would have let rot.
  **THE FINDING, and it is the one this repo keeps rediscovering: all three screens have ZERO production
  callers.** Censused by AST (not `grep` — `policy.py`'s and `gate.py`'s own docstrings name all three, so
  a text-shaped scan reads as "already wired"): `check_app`, `check_input_target` and
  `require_computer_use` are invoked from `tests/` only. The whole package's sole production importer is
  `gateway.py:3869`, which imports `ensure_computer_use_boot` — `DCU-1`'s once-per-run boot row. So no
  clause is enforced against a real driving path, and in particular **nothing links a refusal to a SEL
  row**: `policy` raises without recording, by design, because `gate` is a separate step a caller must
  remember. That is correct sequencing (`DCU-3` owns the driver, `DCU-4` owns `service.py`'s chain and the
  `computer_*` tools) but it means the `done_when`'s end-to-end phrasing is only demonstrable at `DCU-4`,
  whose own `done_when` already repeats it verbatim ("a secure-field refusal, SEL records present").
  **This inertness was invisible to every gate on `main`, so it is now a test.** Added
  `tests/test_computer_use_call_sites.py` — an AST census of the three screens' production call sites,
  shipped at the measured population (ZERO) per the repo's rail idiom, which reds the moment the first
  caller appears and tells that author to assert the CALL SITE (refusal through the dispatch path, and a
  SEL row on the ALLOWED path as well as the refused one — separately). Nothing else could catch it:
  `inert-surface-baseline.json` censuses five surface kinds (config, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`, enum, trigger
  kind, SDK export) and has **zero** occurrences of `computer_use`, so a module-level function with no
  importer is outside its vocabulary; `test_the_packages_public_surface_is_pinned` pins the three names
  as API but says nothing about anyone calling them. Three vacuity floors ship with it — a synthetic
  wired caller in all three spellings IS detected, prose naming the screens is NOT counted, and the
  corpus glob really reaches both shipped modules. Falsified: adding one real
  `policy.check_app(...)` call to `gate.py` reds it naming the file.
  **DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT — an owner call, not a guess.** A chain rail binding steps 2/4/5 the way
  `DCU-1`'s `test_every_computer_use_entry_point_guards_first` binds step 1 would have to choose
  `DCU-4`'s composition for it: a per-tool "must call `check_input_target`" rail contradicts `DCU-4`'s
  scope (the chain lives in a central `service.py` dispatch, not in each tool), and a central-dispatch
  rail has no dispatch to bind to yet. `DCU-1` left the same tension unresolved — its keystone rail
  requires every `computer_*` function in the package to call `require_enabled()` FIRST, which a central
  chain would satisfy only if the tools re-check it. Recorded for whoever takes `DCU-4`.
