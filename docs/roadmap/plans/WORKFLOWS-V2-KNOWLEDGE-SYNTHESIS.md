# Plan: Knowledge Artifact Synthesis via Workflow Nodes

**Status:** DONE — sessions 34-39 shipped (PRs #173-#177, on `main`): store semantics +
`item_relations`, the `knowledge-persist`/`knowledge-retrieve` provider pair (registered in
`action_providers/registry.py`, allowlisted in `validation.py` + `triggers/screen.py`, and consumed
by 4 bundled templates), the long-run engine additions, consolidation/maintenance, contradiction +
retrieval polish, and the template slate. `KnowledgeConfig` 4-point wired. `read_when` retrieval
matching is live, so the S35 "NOT DONE" note is stale.
**Residual:** the model-tier conflict pass is unwired to a live model. Status corrected 2026-08-04 by
code audit. (rev 2 — research-integrated 2026-07-12)

## Boundary: KNOWLEDGE vs MEMORY vs ARTIFACTS (read first)

This plan was flagged for conflating memory and knowledge. Rev 2 draws the line where the code draws it (verified against `src/gideon/` 2026-07-12):

**KNOWLEDGE = the user's personal items.** Documents, files, photos, notes, bookmarks, journals — one GLOBAL library in `~/.gideon/workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db` (`knowledge/store.py`, one item = one logical document; the `namespace` column was deliberately dropped — there is NO per-project partitioning). Future knowledge PROVIDERS may be Google Drive, Google Photos, Notion, etc. The seam for that exists — `knowledge_providers/base.py` `KnowledgeProvider` ABC (async) + object-keyed registry + the `provider` attribution column on items — but today retrieval bypasses it entirely (`registry.search_all()` has zero production callers; the real path is `knowledge/retrieval.py` `HybridRetriever` directly). **Making that seam real for retrieval is in-scope here** (§2.2).

**MEMORY = the harness's own internal mechanics.** What the agent knows about the user and its work: semantic facts, preference facets, episodic records, procedural priors, lessons, persona, commitments — `~/.gideon/memory.db` (`vector_memory.py`, `memory_service.py`), cwd-PARTITIONED (unlike knowledge's one global library), with its own sync `MemoryProvider` ABC, string-keyed registry, normalized embedding blobs, and its own decay/promotion/consolidation machinery. **Memory is entirely OUT of scope for this plan.** Anything in the approved research that is really about memory — lessons, facets, decay weighting, episodic→semantic promotion, user-modeling extraction — is re-pointed to **WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL.md** with an explicit cross-reference at the point of re-direction. This plan never writes to memory.db and never introduces a memory↔knowledge cross-link (none exists in code today, deliberately).

**ARTIFACTS = a third, separate registry.** `artifacts/registry.py` holds named, VERSIONED, LLM-generated content (widget/html/markdown/svg) under `~/.gideon/artifacts/`. It has no structural relationship to knowledge today — the `also_artifact` link proposed in rev 1 **does not exist**; this plan specifies it as an explicit dual-write (§2.1, field `also_artifact`), i.e., two registry calls with metadata back-references, not a shared record. (Beware the naming collision: `knowledge/pipeline/runner.py:_cleanup_orphaned_artifacts` refers to derived media FILES, not the artifacts registry.)

Consequences enforced throughout this plan:
1. `knowledge_persist` / `knowledge_retrieve` are **knowledge-store action providers ONLY**. They read/write knowledge.db via the store + the ONE ingest queue. No memory writes, ever.
2. Knowledge is **never ambiently injected into chat** (existing deliberate invariant — it enters chat only via the composer @-picker or agent `knowledge_search` tool). §5.3's Session Brief injects into **workflow runs**, not chat context, preserving this.
3. Knowledge embeddings are raw un-normalized f32 (`knowledge/embedder.py`); memory's are L2-normalized. The stores share exactly one seam — the active embedding binding (`embedding_providers/registry.get_active_embed_fn()`) — and nothing else.

---

## Overview

Knowledge artifact synthesis evolves from a terminal side-effect of loop completion into a **first-class composable pattern** within Workflows v2. No new node types are required — synthesis is expressed as a three-node sequence (accumulate → synthesize → persist) using existing node kinds plus new **action providers** (`knowledge_persist`, `knowledge_retrieve`, and an optional deferred `render_report`). Long-running workflows update knowledge incrementally with bounded cost, and workflows consume existing knowledge as input.

Rev 2 adds the two halves rev 1 was missing:

1. **Store semantics** (§3): structured, idempotent, provenance-carrying writes (typed kinds + claims, deterministic identity, compiled-truth + append-only timeline, typed relations, contradiction flagging) — a correctness requirement under the engine's retry/resume/rewind, since a naively re-executed persist node must be a harmless no-op.
2. **Long-run mechanics** (§4): item identity + persistent seen-sets, bounded diff-aware synthesis windows, volume-driven triggers, and lineage-capped consolidation — the difference between the monitoring template demoing once and running for months.

It also adds the missing **maintenance lifecycle** (§3.4): the plan previously only created knowledge; nothing maintained it.

---

## 1. The Synthesis Pattern: Three Existing Node Types

The canonical knowledge-synthesis pattern composes from standard nodes:

```yaml
# Accumulate (zero-token, reshapes prior stage outputs)
- id: accumulate
  kind: transform
  expr: "{{nodes.research.output | flatten | filter('verdict','confirmed')}}"

# Synthesize (LLM stage, produces structured article)
- id: synthesize
  kind: stage
  label: "Synthesize knowledge article"
  prompt: |
    Synthesize the accumulated findings into a structured knowledge article.
    Findings: {{nodes.accumulate.output}}
    Consolidate existing data; do not generate new knowledge.
    Produce: title, summary, body (markdown), topics, key points, claims with evidence.
  schema:
    title: string
    summary: string
    body: string
    topics: [string]
    key_points: [string]
    claims: [object]
  effort: high

# Persist (zero-token action, writes to knowledge store)
- id: persist
  kind: action
  label: "Save to knowledge base"
  provider: knowledge_persist
  config:
    title: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.title}}"
    content: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.body}}"
    summary: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.summary}}"
    tags: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.topics}}"
    kind: insight
    claims: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.claims}}"
    citations: "{{nodes.rag.output.trace_id | as_list}}"
    also_artifact: true
    artifact_kind: markdown
```

**Why no new node type:** Each step maps cleanly to an existing kind. The `transform` collects data, the `stage` runs synthesis intelligence, and the `action` persists. This is a PATTERN (reified as a template macro / subworkflow), not a primitive.

**Persist returns its item id** in the node output (`{{nodes.persist.output.item_id}}`) — downstream nodes and later iterations reference the persisted item through normal node-output bindings. (Rev 1's `{{state.last_persist_id}}` was a dangling reference to state that nothing set; KNOW-R1c removes the need for it.)

---

## 2. New Action Providers

### How these plug into the provider architecture (non-negotiable wiring)

Per the platform's pluggable-provider rules (recon: providers.md):

- **Delivery:** the providers ship as a native app `apps/native/knowledge-actions/` with `providers[]` in the manifest (an app may contribute N providers via `AppManifest.all_providers()`), each `{type: "action", implementation: "provider:create_<name>", entity: "knowledge"}` — following the `apps/webhook-action` precedent and WORKFLOWS-V2's own `apps/native/run-workflow-action/`. Each factory returns an `ActionProvider` (`action_providers/base.py:50`: `name`/`display_name`, `supports_blocking=False`, `supports_dry_run=True` for `knowledge_retrieve` (read-only) and False for `knowledge_persist`, `execute(action_config, ctx, timeout) -> ActionResult`).
- **Allowlist:** every new action provider name MUST be added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (`validation.py:555`) or hook create/update rejects it even though the UI offers it. Names added: `knowledge-persist`, `knowledge-retrieve` (+ `render-report` when §6.2 ships).
- **Registration:** the app loader's ActionTypeHandler registers into `action_providers/registry.py:register_action_provider`, making them dispatchable from all three dispatch sites (`hooks.py:494`, `gateway.py:701`, `event_triggers.py:214`) AND the workflow engine's `action` node dispatcher (WORKFLOWS-V2 Slice 1).
- **Config:** knowledge currently has NO config dataclass — `knowledge.fetch_top_n`/`fetch_max_tokens` are raw dict reads in `handlers/knowledge.py`. This plan introduces a typed `KnowledgeConfig` dataclass and wires it through **all FOUR points**: (a) dataclass fields with `_meta(label, help)`, (b) `AppConfig.load()` field-by-field mapping, (c) `to_dict()` (new top-level section), (d) `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist + FE for the runtime-editable knobs. New fields: `fetch_top_n` / `fetch_max_tokens` (migrated from raw reads), `synthesis_window` (default 20), `seal_threshold_items` (0 = off), `lint_every_n_persists` (12), `session_brief_max_tokens` (1200).
- **Retrieval through the provider seam (making it real):** `knowledge_retrieve` resolves providers via `knowledge_providers/registry.py` — native first, then any registered external — instead of calling `HybridRetriever` directly. The `NativeKnowledgeProvider` grows a `search()` implementation that delegates to `HybridRetriever`; `search_all()` gains its first production caller. This is the concrete step that lets a future Google Drive/Photos `KnowledgeProvider` participate in workflow retrieval the day it registers (the ABC + registry + `provider` column already exist; no OAuth/sync work in this plan). Also fix in passing: `knowledge_providers.registry:create_native_provider` currently returns `None` (the app-manifest factory is a stub; real construction lives in `dashboard/state.py:1108`) — repoint the manifest factory at the real constructor.
- **Writes through the ONE queue:** `knowledge_persist` writes via `store.create_typed_item(...)` (or the idempotent update path, §2.1) + `ingest_queue.enqueue(item_id)` — the single enrichment path all creators use. Synthesized notes route through the Passthrough pipeline graph (they arrive already structured; terminal stages still run entities/embedding/dedup).

### 2.1 `knowledge_persist` — Write to Knowledge Store *(KNOW-R1, R13, R17, R19)*

| Config Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | Article title |
| `content` | string | Markdown body |
| `summary` | string | One-line summary for retrieval |
| `tags` | [string] | Topic tags |
| `kind` | string | Typed taxonomy: `fact` / `decision` / `insight` / `report` / `reference` / `known-issue` / `preference-note` / `glossary` / `overview` / `probe`. Stored in a new nullable `kind` column added via the store's `_migrate` machinery; `item_type` stays one of the 12 `NATIVE_TYPES` (default `note`) because it routes the ingestion pipeline graph. |
| `claims` | [object] | Optional structured claims: `{id, statement, status, confidence, hedging: asserted\|hedged\|speculative, evidence: [{source_ref, quote}], valid_at, invalid_at}`. Statement rule: phenomenon-level (numbers/specifics live in `quote`/`source_ref`), so claims are comparable across sources. Supersession SETS `invalid_at`, never deletes — "what was true when" stays queryable. Stored in `file_metadata` JSON (items are not chunked; no new table). |
| `ops` | object | Optional op-list payload alternative to a blob: `{create: [...], update: [...], delete: [...]}` against near items the synthesis stage was pre-loaded with — diff-shaped writes with built-in dedup. |
| `citations` | [string] | Ids into retrieval traces / source items (§5.2). The provider ENFORCES "no synthesized item without citations" for `kind: insight|report` unless `unsourced: true` is set explicitly. |
| `source_ref` | string | Provenance (auto-filled: `workflow:{run_id}:{node_id}`) |
| `source` | object | `{source_system, date, url?, source_tier: primary\|secondary, origin: user\|agent}`. `origin: user` items are protected gold (§4.4). `unsourced: true` replaces silent unattributed storage. |
| `extraction` | string | `llm` / `heuristic` — provenance of the extraction tier (§2.3) |
| `expires_at` / `ttl` | string | Optional expiry for knowledge that goes stale on a known clock (price quotes, schedules). `knowledge_retrieve` demotes/filters past-expiry items via freshness metadata (§2.2d). |
| `also_artifact` | bool | ALSO register in the artifacts registry (`artifacts/registry.py`) — an explicit second write producing an `Artifact` whose metadata carries the knowledge `item_id` back-reference, and the knowledge item's `file_metadata` carries the artifact name. No shared record exists or is created (boundary section). |
| `artifact_kind` | string | `markdown` / `json` / `csv` / `html` |
| `mode` | string | `create` / `upsert` (default) / `append_evidence` (§3.1) |

**Idempotency by construction (KNOW-R1b):** deterministic logical identity `{kind}:{normalized_title}` resolved via lookup-before-write (items keep their UUID PKs; the logical key is an indexed derived column), plus a content hash of the persisted payload. A retried/resumed/rewound persist node whose `(logical_key, content_hash)` already exists is a **no-op returning the existing `item_id`**. Same-content re-persist of a known claim appends a *mention* `{source_ref, confidence, quote}` and re-aggregates confidence via `1-∏(1-cᵢ)`, exposing `support_count` as a retrieval ranking signal (§3.1) — reinforce-on-duplicate, never duplicate-insert.

**Capacity budgets with error-as-return (KNOW-R1 am5):** each `kind` carries a size budget (KnowledgeConfig); a persist that would exceed it returns a descriptive `ActionResult{success: false, error: "over budget by N chars — condense and retry"}` (not an exception), so the synthesizing stage can condense and retry under the engine's normal retry semantics.

**Fire-and-forget enrichment:** the primary record writes synchronously; embedding/entity extraction runs async via the existing ingest queue (never blocks the workflow path); an idempotent backfill loop (`{processed, remaining, done}`) covers records the queue missed.

**Return value:** `{item_id, logical_key, created: bool, mentions_appended: int}`.

**Decision-shaped payloads (KNOW-R13):** `kind: decision` accepts `{question, options, choice, rationale, rejected_alternatives, constraints}` rendered into a canonical body — journals keep the "what", decisions keep the "why" that consolidation otherwise drops. A bundled decision-log pattern: each approval/gate/steer event in a run (e.g. §6's `approve-publish` gate) appends a `kind: decision` item tagged with the run's project, included in §5.3's Session Brief so resumed/forked runs don't re-litigate settled choices. *(The memory-side half of R13 — retention/decay weighting for `source=user` MEMORY records — belongs to the memory subsystem and is re-pointed to WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL.)*

### 2.2 `knowledge_retrieve` — Query Knowledge Store *(KNOW-R8, R12)*

Routes through the `knowledge_providers` registry (native → `HybridRetriever`: FTS5 + entity-graph + vector, RRF k=60, relevance-cliff 0.30, min cosine 0.25 — all existing).

| Config Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | string | Natural-language query (or binding expression) |
| `mode` | string | `semantic` (default) / `fts` — an LLM-free full-text tier over `items_fts` with cursor pagination, distinct from the budgeted semantic tier |
| `filters` | object | `{tags: [...], kind: ..., item_type: ..., date_range: ..., project: ...}` (project = tag-scoped within the ONE global library — knowledge has no partitions) |
| `top_k` | integer | Max results (default 5, hard cap) |
| `detail` | string | `brief` / `compact` / `full` — per-result token caps replacing rev 1's `include_content: bool`, so a `top_k: 10` context-load can't blow a downstream stage's window |

**Each hit carries (KNOW-R8c,d):**
- `evidence: exact_title | keyword | vector | graph` + `create_safety: exists | probable | unknown` — so workflow nodes branch update-vs-create WITHOUT an LLM duplicate check (this is what §2.1's idempotent persist keys off);
- freshness metadata `{age_days, last_verified, expired: bool}` (from `updated_at` + a new `last_verified` column + `expires_at`) so the synthesizing LLM can reason about staleness;
- `relevance_score`, `support_count`, `status: seedling|growing|evergreen` (§4.4f) as ranking inputs.

**Retrieval mechanics (KNOW-R8e + amendments):** always-include the matching `kind: overview` item when one exists; one-hop expansion over `confidence ≥ 0.7` typed relations (§3.2) with graph hits enriching but never displacing direct hits; explicit degradation ladder vector → FTS → substring with strategy telemetry in the trace (§5.2); topic-extraction-before-retrieval as a template convention for persist-time neighbor checks (cheap pass extracts topics from new input, uses them as queries — "understand first, then check what I already know"); optional local cross-encoder rerank arm delivered later as a normal local-model provider (out of this plan's critical path).

**`read_when` triggers (KNOW-R12):** `knowledge_persist` accepts an optional `read_when: [string]` trigger-condition list (stored in `file_metadata`); `knowledge_retrieve` additionally matches `read_when` conditions against the current node's task text. A retrieve returning zero results emits a `coverage_gap` run-journal event that the periodic synthesizer turns into a persist proposal.

**Output:** `{items: [...], trace_id, strategy, truncated: "N older items not consulted" | null}`.

### 2.3 Zero-Model Heuristic Extraction Floor *(KNOW-R17)*

When no LLM resolves for the synthesis use-case (`provider_bridge.can_resolve_use_case` is the cheap no-instantiate probe), `knowledge_persist` and ingest templates degrade to a deterministic tier: frequency + bigram candidate extraction, first-paragraph summary, wikilink/reference structural linking — filing entries with `extraction: heuristic`. A background enrichment workflow (provider-available event or sparse cadence) re-runs LLM extraction on `heuristic`-stamped entries and upgrades them in place. The template graph shape stays identical; only the extraction tier swaps. This is the local-first resilience floor — the pipeline never silently stops on provider loss.

---

## 3. Store Semantics for Workflow-Maintained Knowledge

### 3.1 Compiled Truth + Append-Only Timeline *(KNOW-R2)*

Every workflow-MAINTAINED knowledge item (monitors, watchers, living documents) has one shape:

- a **compiled-summary section** on top (the current truth), and
- **append-only dated evidence entries** below — delimited regions with explicit markers so the document stays human-editable and machine-parseable (the item's single `content` field; items are one logical document by design, chunking was removed).

The periodic synthesizer rewrites ONLY the compiled section (`mode: upsert` targets the compiled region). Evidence entries are immutable and can be persisted EARLY (`mode: append_evidence` — persist-raw-first while sources are fresh, including evidence-bundle manifests `{files, digests, summary}`), with synthesis arriving later.

Store-level invariants:
1. Scoring/annotation of existing items persists as **sidecar overlay records** `{value, reason, model, scored_at}` in the item's `file_metadata`, keyed to the canonical item — the watcher re-processes only overlay-stale items.
2. Persisting an already-known claim appends a **mention** and re-aggregates confidence (§2.1) — `support_count` becomes a ranking signal.
3. **Contradiction rule:** keep both claims with citations under a source-precedence ladder (user statement > compiled truth > timeline > external), never silently pick one.

Rev 1's `"Topic — Progress ({{iter}})"` per-iteration item spam becomes **ONE canonical item** with an evidence/mention history.

### 3.2 Typed Relations + Contradiction Flagging at Persist Time *(KNOW-R6)*

**Typed item relations:** a new `item_relations(source_item_id, target_item_id, relation_type, confidence, provenance, created_at)` table (added via `_migrate`; sibling to the existing entity-level `entity_relations`), with a 5-verb vocabulary: `supersedes`, `contradicts`, `derived_from`, `depends_on`, `part_of`; upsert on `(source, target, relation)`. Edges carry provenance `extracted` (deterministic, confidence 1.0) vs `inferred`/`ambiguous` (LLM, confidence-scored). `derived_from` doubles as §4.4's `parent_ids` — one mechanism. Deliberately item-fields-plus-report, NOT a graph database, per personal-scale guardrails.

**Contradiction check on persist:** (1) deterministic pre-LLM test — flag claims sharing subject+predicate with different objects, or subject+object with different predicates (zero-cost, enabled by §2.1's claims structure); (2) then retrieve semantically-near items (the existing hybrid retriever gives a strictly better neighbor set than a recency window) and run a fast-model conflict check via `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")`. Conflicts store as first-class records surfaced in the knowledge UI and in periodic-synthesizer output — flag at ingest, not query.

**Cost controls:** background edge inference is memoized per-item by content hash (only changed items re-hit a haiku-class model); deterministic candidate shortlist (field/entity overlap scoring, cap 30, exclude same-source) before ONE fast-model call proposing ≤5 typed edges with ≤25-word justification — graph-size-independent marginal cost; ≤10 relations per pass. The background pass's action vocabulary for each new item's neighbors: `link` / `merge` / `update-neighbor-tags` — new knowledge can retroactively refine its neighbors. Merges canonicalize to a stable representative id preserving source lineage (never orphan back-references).

### 3.3 Per-Store `schema.md` Conventions Contract *(KNOW-R16)*

A durable conventions document at `workspace/knowledge/schema.md` — kinds in use, naming conventions, linking rules, ingest conventions, emphasis rules — loaded into `knowledge_persist`/synthesis context on every write/synthesis operation. Structure IS the contract; the intelligence tier is swappable (heuristic floor and LLM nodes write into identical structure).

The synthesizer may **PROPOSE** edits to schema.md when the user repeatedly overrides conventions — routed through the propose-don't-write proposal queue owned by **WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL** (the trust anchor; modeled on the existing `skills/proposals.py` pattern), never direct writes. Accepted schema edits trigger a re-validate warning on downstream templates.

### 3.4 Maintenance Lifecycle: Three Cost-Tiered Bundled Templates *(KNOW-R7)*

The plan previously only created knowledge; nothing maintained it. Three bundled templates, cheap→expensive:

1. **`knowledge-health`** — deterministic, zero-LLM, frequent-trigger: stub detection (<100-char body), orphans (zero inbound relations — flag, never auto-delete), broken references/citations, FTS/embedding/store consistency, past-expiry `kind: probe`/TTL items. Pure `transform` + `action` nodes.
2. **`knowledge-lint`** — semantic LLM pass cadenced by **mutation count** (`lint_every_n_persists`, default ~12 — not wall clock): contradictions (§3.2 report), staleness, gaps + suggested sources. Rule: health runs first ("linting an empty item wastes tokens").
3. **`gap-healing`** — phantom-hub detection (entity referenced by ≥N items with no item of its own) drafts missing entries from source excerpts but emits them as **PROPOSALS through the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL queue**, never direct writes (direct-write healing is the studied anti-pattern). Complement: unresolved wikilinks render in the knowledge reading UI as a visible affordance with click-to-propose-draft — the store's growth frontier surfaced continuously.

**Differential refresh:** ingested items store a source back-pointer + content hash — whole-source `content_hash` PLUS per-section `chunk_hashes` in `file_metadata` — and the refresh template re-synthesizes only sections whose hash changed. Invariant: store and compare the SAME hash form (the studied truncated-vs-full mismatch made everything permanently stale).

## 4. Incremental Knowledge Updates During Long Runs

### Problem

A research workflow running for hours accumulates findings across dozens of stages. Waiting until the end to synthesize means partial results are invisible, a crash loses unsynthesized work, and the user can't query in-progress findings. And a naive `until_cancelled` watcher degrades within days: re-processed items, unbounded sibling context, self-synthesis drift.

### Solution: Periodic Synthesis via Parallel Watcher (rev 2 mechanics)

```yaml
root:
  kind: parallel
  join: any  # Complete when the main work finishes (watcher runs alongside)
  children:
    - id: main-work
      kind: loop
      mode: {until_dry: {streak: 3, progress_field: "new_findings"}}
      body:
        kind: stage
        label: "Research cycle"
        prompt: |
          Already known (do NOT re-report — return only the DELTA):
          {{nodes.context-load.output.items | map('summary') | join('\n')}}
          ...
        schema: {findings: [{guid: string, statement: string, significance: string}],
                 new_findings: integer}

    - id: periodic-synthesizer
      kind: loop
      mode: {until_cancelled: true}  # runs until sibling completes (join:any cancels it)
      body:
        kind: sequence
        children:
          - kind: wait
            duration_secs: 300
            # or buffer-seal (§4.3): condition = buffer_full OR stale_timeout

          - id: novel
            kind: transform
            expr: "{{siblings.main-work.output | window(20) | unseen}}"
            # window = synthesis_window; unseen = engine-maintained seen-set (§4.1)

          - id: synthesize-progress
            kind: stage
            label: "Synthesize progress snapshot"
            prompt: |
              Consolidate existing data; never generate new knowledge.
              Prior compiled truth: {{previous.output.summary | default('None yet')}}
              Novel findings this window: {{nodes.novel.output}}
            schema: {report: string, confidence: string, gaps: [string]}
            effort: low

          - id: persist
            kind: action
            provider: knowledge_persist
            config:
              title: "{{inputs.topic}} — Monitor"
              content: "{{nodes.synthesize-progress.output.report}}"
              kind: insight
              mode: upsert          # ONE canonical item; compiled section rewritten,
                                    # evidence appended (§3.1). Idempotent on retry.
            on_error: journal_and_continue   # persist failures are non-fatal (§4.2e)
```

### 4.1 Item Identity + Persistent Seen-Set + Delta Rule *(KNOW-R3)*

- Every accumulate iteration emits items with a stable **`guid`** (composable from extracted fields, RSS-style).
- The engine maintains a per-watcher **persistent seen-set** for `until_cancelled` loops (in the run journal, surviving resume/crash) so the synthesizer only ever sees novel items.
- **Delta rule:** the retrieval stage's already-known output is injected into the scan/research prompt with an explicit "return only the DELTA" instruction.
- Source streams are consumed **cursor-style** with a consumed-only-advance rule and per-item bounded retry (window queries drop late/transiently-failed items rather than stalling the cursor).
- A **web-item hygiene** transform preset (off-domain drop, min-title-words) so monitoring templates don't reimplement junk filtering.
- Template-doc anti-pattern note: stateless repetition of cumulative work is a designed-in failure — `until_cancelled` bodies MUST thread persisted per-iteration state.

### 4.2 Bounded-Context, Diff-Aware Continuation *(KNOW-R4, R14)*

- **`synthesis_window: N`** (KnowledgeConfig default 20): the synthesize stage merges only the last N findings per cycle — `{{siblings.main-work.output}}` no longer returns ALL iterations unbounded.
- **`{{siblings.<id>.output}}` defaults to a filtered insight view** — only items above a significance threshold (default 0.7) cross the sibling boundary, with an explicit `| full` opt-out (KNOW-R14). The engine additionally compresses any single sibling payload >2000 chars via LLM-summarize with a deterministic-truncate fallback when the model call fails.
- **Convergence guard (KNOW-R14):** in multi-source templates, the synthesize stage computes pairwise diversity over accumulated inputs; diversity < 0.7 without high confidence flags "sources converged early / possible echo" in the output schema and persisted artifact.
- **`{{previous.output}}` binding** — the prior successful cycle/run of the same template — plus auto-threaded continuation inputs (`prior_report`, `prior_findings`, `prior_seen_refs`) make synthesis **diff-aware**: the interesting knowledge is the diff, not the snapshot.
- **Run-continuity state (zero-setup tier):** a bounded rolling object stored ON the workflow def/trigger record itself — `{summary: last-5 dated outcome lines, recent_topics: cap 10, recent_refs: cap 20}` — auto-injected into the next recurring run under a "Context from previous runs — avoid repeating, build on prior work" header. This is engine/run state, NOT the memory subsystem, and no knowledge-store round-trip is needed for it.
- **Synthesize-then-truncate:** after a successful persist, the accumulated sibling window is pruned from next cycle's injection — the synthesis output doubles as a structured handoff for a fresh session.
- The cycle's structured output may propose `next_cycle_delay_seconds`, clamped to a configured `[min, max]`.
- **Persist failures inside the watcher are non-fatal** — journaled, retried next cycle.
- **Payload discipline:** run-outcome persists capped (~800 chars, keyword-searchable hints, not blob storage); retrieved snippets injected capped under explicit headers with a verify-before-relying disclaimer.

### 4.3 Buffer-Seal: Volume-Driven Synthesis Trigger *(KNOW-R9)*

Alternative watcher trigger alongside wall-clock cadence: accumulate findings into a buffer; synthesize fires when the buffer FILLS (seal), with a `flush_stale` path for long-idle buffers. Template config: `seal_threshold: N items | K tokens`, `flush_stale_after: duration`. Composes with existing loop/wait nodes (the wait condition becomes buffer-full OR stale-timeout) — no new node kind. A quiet week costs zero LLM calls; a busy hour synthesizes promptly.

Third trigger mode (write-triggered compaction, production-verified): on each `knowledge_persist`, retrieve the new item's neighborhood; if ≥5 items cluster at ≥0.62 similarity, LLM-summarize with doctrine "preserve EVERY distinct detail"; archive originals with `summary_id` back-refs (reversible — `is_archived` flag, never delete); on failure leave the cluster untouched. Cost scales with writes, not store size.

### 4.4 Consolidation Mechanics + Lineage Caps for the Periodic Synthesizer *(KNOW-R5, R13)*

The "synthesize progress snapshot" stage gets tested, parameterized mechanics:

1. **Lineage caps:** every synthesized item carries `parent_ids` (= `derived_from` relations, §3.2) back to its inputs; inputs get a `reflection_count` increment with eligibility `reflection_count < 3` for future passes — without this the watcher re-synthesizes its own output and drift compounds.
2. **Deterministic pre-dedup** (normalize, fuzzy-hash ~0.95) before any LLM call; plus a zero-LLM structural pre-pass clearing already-consolidated raw entries so each pass is incremental.
3. **Reference algorithm:** cluster accumulated items via similarity/graph traversal (similarity ≥0.75, min cluster 5, cap ~10 clusters/sweep, batch cap 100); LLM-synthesize ONE insight per cluster with a confidence score; persist the summary WITH parent links; demote originals (archive + ranking demotion via `is_archived` — knowledge items have no decay field and this plan does not add one) but **never delete**.
4. **Prompt doctrine** for all background synthesis: "consolidate existing data, never generate new knowledge".
5. **Trigger/precondition gate stack:** a `consolidated` flag-cursor (batch-select-where-unprocessed, flip on success; backlog count as a health metric), min-hours + min-new-material gates, consolidation lock (abort if contended, via the existing `single_flight` seam), pre-run snapshot + post-run diff + rollback on failure, preview/dry-run mode, bounded stale-candidate set (top 20). Aging tier: DATE-BUCKETED compaction — entries older than a threshold grouped by week/month, one summary per bucket replacing originals with source-id back-references. Track a **compression ratio** per pass as the subsystem's health metric.
6. **Maturity field:** `status: seedling | growing | evergreen` on items, weighted by `knowledge_retrieve` ranking.
7. **Human-gold protection (KNOW-R13):** `source.origin: user` items are persisted FIRST and are exempt from demotion/archival in any consolidation pass — agent discoveries are re-derivable; user decisions are not.

> **Boundary note (KNOW-R5 re-point):** all of the above operates on knowledge.db items produced by workflows. The research's per-memory-kind consolidation modes (episodic-only / semantic-only "dream" passes) describe the MEMORY subsystem — Gideon already has that machinery (`vector_memory.promote_episodic_patterns`, `memory_service` consolidation cadence), and any changes to it belong to **WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL**, not here.

### Loop Mode: `until_cancelled`

Unchanged from rev 1 (adopted into WORKFLOWS-V2): the loop runs indefinitely until externally cancelled (sibling completing in a `join:any` parallel, user cancellation, or timeout). Cleanest expression of watcher/monitor patterns.

```
loop modes: counted{n} | until{condition} | until_dry{streak, progress_field} | until_cancelled
```

### Sibling Output Access

**Binding: `{{siblings.<id>.output}}`** — resolves to outputs emitted by a named sibling within the same `parallel` block, as a filtered, windowed view by default (§4.2). `| full` opts out of the significance filter; `| window(N)` bounds it; `| unseen` applies the persistent seen-set.

---

## 5. Knowledge as Workflow Input

### 5.1 Pattern: Retrieval Stage at Workflow Start

```yaml
- id: context-load
  kind: action
  label: "Load relevant knowledge"
  provider: knowledge_retrieve
  config:
    query: "{{inputs.topic}}"
    filters: {tags: ["{{inputs.domain}}"]}
    top_k: 10
    detail: compact        # per-result token caps — can't blow the downstream window

- id: work
  kind: stage
  prompt: |
    {{nodes.context-load.output.items | fenced_sources}}
    Now do: {{inputs.task}}
```

### 5.2 Provenance Journaling, Citation Enforcement, Fencing *(KNOW-R10)*

- `knowledge_retrieve` journals a **retrieval trace** `{query, strategy, ranked candidates with scores, selected flags}` as a run-journal record (trace_id returned in output) and emits sources as a typed side-channel event on the progress stream.
- Retrieved content interpolated into stage prompts MUST be wrapped in the existing `<untrusted_content>` fence (`security.fence_untrusted`, re-exported via `sdk.security`) with a numbered-sources block and a cite-[n] / "say so if sources don't answer" instruction — knowledge items partly derive from web/inbox content, so raw interpolation bypasses the platform's fencing doctrine. (Knowledge already fences at ingest — `knowledge/insights.py:29` — and redacts on the way out in `search-for-context`; this extends the same doctrine to workflow interpolation via a `fenced_sources` binding filter.)
- `knowledge_persist` for synthesis nodes accepts `citations[]` (ids into retrieval traces / source items), enforcing "no synthesized item without source citations" **at the provider, not the prompt** (§2.1).

### 5.3 Push-Based Retrieval: Project Session Brief *(KNOW-R12)*

Per-project curated knowledge (project = tag/`project_id`-scoped within the ONE global library; knowledge has no partitions) compiles into a bounded **Session Brief** (`session_brief_max_tokens`) injected at the start of every workflow RUN in that project — the cheap, non-engine-invasive realization of the explicitly-deferred `auto_rag` runtime hint (no per-stage engine injection). Includes the project's decision log (§2.1).

**Scope guard:** the Session Brief is composed by the workflow engine into RUN context only. It does NOT create ambient knowledge injection into chat sessions — the platform's deliberate "knowledge is never auto-injected into chat" invariant (composer @-picker / agent tool only) stands.

`coverage_gap` journal events (zero-result retrieves, §2.2) become persist proposals for the periodic synthesizer — closing the accumulate→synthesize→persist feedback loop.

### Automatic Context Enrichment (still deferred)

Engine-level `auto_rag` (inject a retrieve before every stage) remains explicitly DEFERRED post-v2. The Session Brief covers the 80% case without engine complexity.

## 6. The Monitoring → Synthesis Pattern + Visual Outputs

### 6.1 Monitoring Template (rev 2)

```yaml
name: market-monitor
description: "Monitor market trends and produce periodic synthesis reports"
inputs:
  topic: {type: string, required: true}
  sources: {type: array, required: true}
  report_interval_hours: {type: integer, default: 168}
  # KNOW-R11/OpenJarvis parameter vocabulary — variation is configuration, not new YAML:
  observation_compression: {type: string, default: summarize, enum: [summarize, truncate, none]}
  retrieval_strategy: {type: string, default: hybrid, enum: [hybrid, keyword, semantic, none]}
root:
  kind: loop
  mode: {until_cancelled: true}
  body:
    kind: sequence
    children:
      - id: known
        kind: action
        provider: knowledge_retrieve
        config: {query: "{{inputs.topic}}", filters: {kind: report}, top_k: 3, detail: brief}

      - id: scan
        kind: foreach
        items: "{{inputs.sources}}"
        max_concurrency: 3
        body:
          kind: stage
          label: "Scan {{item}}"
          prompt: |
            Already known: {{nodes.known.output.items | fenced_sources}}
            Check {{item}} for NEW developments about {{inputs.topic}} — return only the DELTA.
          schema: {developments: [{guid: string, headline: string, significance: string, source: string}]}

      - id: filter
        kind: transform
        expr: "{{nodes.scan.output | flatten | hygiene | unseen | filter('significance','high')}}"

      - id: synthesize
        kind: stage
        label: "Periodic synthesis"
        prompt: |
          Consolidate existing data; never generate new knowledge.
          Prior compiled truth: {{previous.output.report | default('None yet')}}
          New developments this period: {{nodes.filter.output}}
        schema: {report: string, key_trends: [string], alerts: [string],
                 next_cycle_delay_seconds: integer}
        effort: high

      - id: persist
        kind: action
        provider: knowledge_persist
        config:
          title: "{{inputs.topic}} Monitor"
          content: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.report}}"
          tags: ["monitor", "{{inputs.topic}}"]
          kind: report
          mode: upsert            # ONE canonical item, compiled truth + evidence timeline
          also_artifact: true
        on_error: journal_and_continue

      - id: wait-interval
        kind: wait
        duration_secs: "{{nodes.synthesize.output.next_cycle_delay_seconds | clamp(3600, 604800) | default(inputs.report_interval_hours * 3600)}}"
```

Composes `loop{until_cancelled}` + `foreach` + `transform(hygiene|unseen|filter)` + `stage` + `action(upsert)` + `wait(adaptive)`. No special "monitoring" node type.

### 6.2 `render_report` Action Provider *(KNOW-R15 — deliberately last, deferrable)*

Optional terminal step for synthesis/monitoring templates: takes synthesized content plus a declarative spec (markdown sections; sort/filter/compute table ops over collected outputs; charts compiling to Mermaid xychart-class output) and produces a **sanitized** self-contained HTML/SVG artifact (nh3-style sanitization — inputs are LLM-over-untrusted-web). The SPEC TEXT is stored as the versioned record in the **artifacts registry** (`artifacts/registry.py` — versioning lives there, not in knowledge; knowledge items have no version history) with the rendered output as a derived export, so the periodic synthesizer regenerates visuals from updated data for free.

Plumbing: same as §2 — ActionProvider in `apps/native/knowledge-actions/` `providers[]`, name added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`. Ships only after the store-semantics work lands.

---

## 7. Bundled Template Slate *(KNOW-R11, R18)*

Templates are the plan's proof-of-life — field-tested shapes with real daily content that exercise every new mechanism (guid-dedupe, compiled-truth upserts, retrieval, watcher):

### 7.1 The Slate

1. **`knowledge-synthesis`** — the three-node pattern as a reusable subworkflow macro (§1).
2. **`market-monitor`** — §6.1, the flagship `until_cancelled` instance.
3. **`trending-repo-digest`** — flagship monitor instance with real content: clock → HN/GitHub-trending fetch (via `net.fetch` egress chokepoint) → foreach → guid-dedupe vs store → synthesize plain-English pitch → `knowledge_persist` + inbox digest, per-item "spotted on X" provenance.
4. **Dual-sink watcher variant** — the same synthesizer emits `knowledge_persist` (queryable article) AND an artifact update, with a delivery leg (digest → inbox/channel alert via existing `notify`/`send-message` action providers, subject to the `notification_allowed()` gate).
5. **`meeting-prep`** — upcoming event input → `knowledge_retrieve` on attendees/topics → synthesize brief. (No calendar provider exists today; the event is a template input until one does.)
6. **`thesis-tracker`** — falsifiable statement + pillars + invalidating risks + evidence entries tagged strengthen/weaken/neutralize + review cadence; a pure §3.1 compiled-truth item.
7. **Raw → rolling-summary → one-pager tiering** — period-keyed raw evidence entries, rolling N-month summary, one-page distillation with a will-not-do negative-space slot.
8. **`quality-document`** — synthesizer-maintained artifact grading project modules A–D on verification/legibility/test-stability; downstream runs read it to pick the lowest-grade target first.
9. **`paper-ingest`** — fetch+slice (action) → parallel {summarize+critique on reasoning axis, extract-claims on fast model} → metadata → assemble → parallel deterministic {persist, reference-match, candidate-shortlist, entity-stubs} → link (1 fast-model call) → apply-edges → lint scoped to new items — with a provable 4-LLM-call-per-item budget as a design invariant. (Model tiers via use-case bindings: `reasoning` axis for deep passes, `background` for fast ones — `one_shot_completion` semantics.)
10. **`living-document`** — source set → structured per-source extraction → diff-vs-current-state → NEW/RECURRING/RESOLVED/ON-HOLD reconciliation against the document's own append-only changelog → approval gate; suppressed-recurring-findings state stored in the knowledge item (learned noise-suppression).
11. **`publish-article`** (retained from rev 1) — the full artifact lifecycle: draft (stage) → dual review (parallel, join: all) → revise → approval gate → `knowledge_persist {kind: reference, also_artifact: true}`, with the gate decision appended as a `kind: decision` item (§2.1).
12. **Maintenance trio** — `knowledge-health`, `knowledge-lint`, `gap-healing` (§3.4).

### 7.2 Classifier-Then-Dispatch Rich-Ingest Template *(KNOW-R18)*

"Ingest a 2-hour meeting transcript and populate knowledge + tasks in one pass", composed ONLY of existing node kinds: a cheap classifier stage examines the input and selects which extraction lenses apply (bias: when uncertain, include more lenses — the specialists do final filtering); a `parallel` node fans the SAME input through per-lens extraction stages, each with a different prompt lens and output schema; a converge node dedupes and conflict-checks across lens outputs (§3.2) before final persist.

**Lenses (knowledge + tasks ONLY):** decisions (→ `kind: decision`, §2.1 decision shape), reference materials (→ `kind: reference`), facts/concepts (→ `kind: fact`/`glossary`), reports/summaries (→ `kind: report`), action items (→ the existing `create-task` action provider).

> **Boundary note (KNOW-R18 re-point):** the research's episodic-events and preference/procedural lenses are user-modeling — that is the MEMORY subsystem's job (after-turn capture, preference facets, episodic writes) and is re-pointed to **WORKFLOWS-V2-LEARNING-FLYWHEEL**. This template writes knowledge items and tasks only; it never writes memory.

---

## 8. Changes to WORKFLOWS-V2.md

1. **New loop mode:** `until_cancelled` (§4) — add to Section 1 node taxonomy, with per-watcher persistent seen-set state in the run journal.
2. **New bindings:** `{{siblings.<id>.output}}` (filtered/windowed by default, §4.2) and `{{previous.output}}` (prior successful cycle/run). Binding filters: `window(N)`, `unseen`, `hygiene`, `fenced_sources`, `full`, `clamp`.
3. **New action providers:** `knowledge-persist`, `knowledge-retrieve` (+ deferred `render-report`) — delivered via `apps/native/knowledge-actions/` `providers[]`, registered through the action `_TypeHandler` into `action_providers/registry`, **added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (`validation.py:555`)**.
4. **Run-continuity state** on the workflow def/trigger record (§4.2) — bounded rolling `{summary, recent_topics, recent_refs}` auto-injected into recurring runs.
5. **Journal event types:** `coverage_gap`, retrieval traces, non-fatal persist-failure records.
6. **Bundled templates:** the §7 slate (was: two templates).
7. **Add to Slice 7:** `until_cancelled` + sibling/previous bindings + seen-set.

## 9. Store & Config Changes (this plan's own scope)

- `knowledge/store.py` `_migrate`: new nullable `kind` column + indexed `logical_key` derived column + `last_verified`, `expires_at` columns; new `item_relations` table (§3.2). All additive; existing rows unaffected.
- `file_metadata` JSON carries: claims, mentions, overlays, `parent_ids`/`reflection_count`, `read_when`, content/chunk hashes, `source` provenance block, artifact back-ref.
- New `KnowledgeConfig` dataclass wired through the FOUR config points (§2).
- `NativeKnowledgeProvider.search()` implemented over `HybridRetriever`; `create_native_provider` manifest stub repointed at the real constructor; `search_all()` gains its first caller (`knowledge_retrieve`).
- `workspace/knowledge/schema.md` conventions file (§3.3).
- Knowledge UI: contradiction report surface + unresolved-wikilink affordance (§3.2, §3.4).

---

## Implementation Effort

**6 sessions** (was 2), after Workflows v2 Slices 0-2; +1 optional for `render_report`:

- **Session 1 — Store semantics groundwork:** `kind`/`logical_key`/`last_verified`/`expires_at` migrations, `item_relations` table, claims/mentions/overlay `file_metadata` shapes, content+chunk hashing, `KnowledgeConfig` four-point wiring, `schema.md` scaffold.
- **Session 2 — The provider pair:** `apps/native/knowledge-actions/` app; `knowledge_persist` (idempotent upsert/append_evidence/ops modes, budgets, citations enforcement, dual-artifact write, heuristic floor) + `knowledge_retrieve` (modes, detail budgets, evidence/create_safety, freshness, graph expansion, traces, `read_when`); `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` additions; native provider `search()` + registry routing; three-node pattern end-to-end.
- **Session 3 — Engine additions:** `until_cancelled` loop mode + persistent seen-set; `{{siblings.*}}` (filter/window/unseen) + `{{previous.output}}` + run-continuity state; buffer-seal wait condition; adaptive delay clamp; non-fatal persist handling; convergence guard.
- **Session 4 — Consolidation + maintenance:** §4.4 reflect mechanics (lineage caps, pre-dedup, gate stack, date-bucketed aging, compression-ratio metric); `knowledge-health` / `knowledge-lint` / `gap-healing` templates; proposal routing to the flywheel queue; differential refresh.
- **Session 5 — Contradiction + retrieval polish:** persist-time deterministic + fast-model conflict pass, typed-edge background inference (memoized, capped), contradiction report UI surface; Session Brief + coverage-gap loop; fencing filter (`fenced_sources`).
- **Session 6 — Template slate + validation:** §7 slate incl. rich-ingest; long-run validation of the watcher (idempotent re-runs, bounded cycle cost, seen-set persistence across restart).
- **Session 7 (optional/deferred) — `render_report`** (§6.2).

## Dependencies

- Knowledge store (`knowledge/store.py`) + ingest queue (`knowledge/ingest_queue.py`) — existing; ALL persist writes route through them.
- Artifacts registry (`artifacts/registry.py`) — existing; `also_artifact`/`render_report` write into it explicitly (no knowledge↔artifact link exists today; this plan adds metadata back-refs only).
- Action provider registry + app-loader action `_TypeHandler` (existing) + `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` update (code change in `validation.py`).
- `wait` node support (WORKFLOWS-V2 Slice 1); `until_cancelled` mode (this plan's scope).
- `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` for fast-model passes; `reasoning` axis for deep synthesis (existing use-case bindings).
- `security.fence_untrusted` / `sdk.security` (existing) for §5.2.
- LEARNING-FLYWHEEL proposal queue for §3.3/§3.4 proposal routing (can stub to `skills/proposals.py`-pattern queue if flywheel lands later).

## Risks & Guardrails

- **Self-synthesis drift** → lineage caps (`reflection_count < 3`), "consolidate, never generate" doctrine, demote-never-delete, pre/post snapshots + rollback (§4.4).
- **Retry/rewind double-writes** → idempotency by construction: logical key + content hash no-op, mention-append on duplicates (§2.1).
- **Token burn in long runs** → seen-set + delta rule, `synthesis_window`, filtered siblings, buffer-seal, payload caps (§4).
- **Prompt injection via retrieved knowledge** → mandatory `<untrusted_content>` fencing at interpolation + provider-enforced citations (§5.2).
- **Boundary creep into memory** → this plan touches only knowledge.db + the run journal; every memory-shaped rec is explicitly re-pointed to LEARNING-FLYWHEEL (see Research Integration + boundary notes in §4.4, §7.2).
- **Enterprise-machinery creep** → item-fields-plus-report instead of a graph DB; single-user cadences (mutation-count lint, not fleets); everything propose-don't-write for schema/gap healing.

## Success Criteria

1. A research workflow that runs 10+ cycles produces ONE canonical knowledge article (compiled truth + evidence timeline) accessible via knowledge search, with claims, citations, and `workflow:{run_id}` provenance.
2. Re-executing a persist node (retry/resume/rewind) is a provable no-op: no duplicate items, mention counts stable.
3. The periodic synthesizer runs for a week of simulated cycles with bounded per-cycle token cost (seen-set + window verified) and zero re-processed guids.
4. A `knowledge_retrieve` at workflow start enriches downstream prompts inside `<untrusted_content>` fences, under `detail` budgets, with a journaled retrieval trace.
5. The monitoring template runs indefinitely, adapting its cadence, surviving gateway restart (seen-set + cursor persisted), until cancelled.
6. `knowledge-health` (zero-LLM) and `knowledge-lint` (mutation-cadenced) run over a 100+-item store; gap-healing emits proposals, never direct writes.
7. The contradiction report surfaces a seeded conflict (same subject+predicate, different object) at persist time, with both claims retained under the precedence ladder.
8. The rich-ingest template turns one meeting transcript into typed knowledge items + created tasks in one pass — and writes nothing to memory.db (asserted in the test).
9. The `publish-article` workflow goes draft → dual-review → revise → gate → persist, appending a `kind: decision` item at the gate.
10. With no LLM provider bound, `knowledge_persist` still files entries (`extraction: heuristic`) and the enrichment workflow upgrades them when a provider returns.

## Execution log

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Store semantics groundwork (session 34 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-knowledge-store`. `knowledge/semantics.py`: the 10-kind taxonomy, logical
  identity (`{kind}:{normalized_title}`, unicode/case/punctuation-folded), content + chunk hashing,
  `1-∏(1-cᵢ)` confidence aggregation with a hard sub-1.0 ceiling, claims/mentions with
  source-dedup and `invalid_at` supersession, freshness from `last_verified`/`expires_at`, the
  create/update/reinforce/no-op decision, and the 5-verb typed item relations.
  `knowledge/schema_conventions.py`: the write-once `schema.md` contract. `store.py`: five additive
  columns, the `item_relations` table, and the logical-key index. `KnowledgeConfig` through all four
  wiring points. 11829 tests.

- **DEVIATION — `KnowledgeConfig` did not exist.** The plan reads as though it were an existing
  dataclass gaining fields; it was created from scratch through all four points (dataclass + `_meta`,
  `AppConfig` field, `load()` mapping + section read, `to_dict`, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`).

- **DISCOVERY — three of my own defects, each caught by measuring rather than reading.** The
  logical-key index had to be created inside `_migrate` (the schema block runs before the column
  exists — it failed on a fresh db and silently no-opped on an upgraded one). My index test was
  asserting against a `sqlite3.Row` repr and so could never fail, which is how the missing index went
  unnoticed until the assertion was fixed. And confidence aggregation reached exactly 1.0 at ten
  sources, contradicting its own docstring and making such a claim unfalsifiable.

- **NOT DONE — nothing writes the new columns yet.** They exist, are indexed, and the semantics
  module is pure and store-agnostic so the session-35 provider pair (`knowledge_persist` /
  `knowledge_retrieve`) can be written against it without re-deriving the identity rules. The `ops`
  payload, `also_artifact` dual-write and async enrichment/backfill belong to that pair.

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — The provider pair (session 35 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-knowledge-providers`. `knowledge-persist` (idempotent, error-as-return, claims
  with mention accumulation, tags, TTL, FTS sync) and `knowledge-retrieve` (degradation ladder with
  strategy telemetry, create-safety, freshness, per-result detail caps, always-first overview,
  coverage-gap reporting). Both registered in the action registry AND `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` in the
  same commit. Node provenance threaded through `dispatch_action`. 11870 tests.

- **DISCOVERY — six defects, all found by measuring rather than reading.** `items_fts` is an
  external-content index with NO triggers, so a plain SQL write is not searchable and every retrieve
  degraded to substring silently; the FTS delete must read the OLD values before the row is rewritten
  (a view over the live row returns the new ones, so the delete removed nothing); the hybrid
  retriever fuses with RRF so its ~0.033 scores were rejected wholesale by a cosine-space 0.30 cliff;
  it does not return `kind` or the timestamp columns, so the kind filter matched nothing and freshness
  read zero; both tag tables have NOT NULL timestamps, so every tag insert failed inside a swallowing
  `except`; and `ActionContext` has no `run_id` attribute, so provenance read as "unknown".

- **Validated end-to-end through the live engine:** a three-node retrieve → persist → confirm
  template. First run: coverage gap, create, then a hybrid hit with `safety=exists`. Second run of the
  same template: the SAME `item_id`, `created: false`, "identical content already stored — idempotent
  no-op". That is the property the whole session exists to provide.

- **NOT DONE:** the `ops` payload, `also_artifact` dual-write, retrieve-time `read_when` matching, the
  `coverage_gap` ledger event, and the async enrichment/backfill loop — the last is a deliberate
  best-effort hook whose target does not exist yet, and the backfill covering what the queue missed
  belongs to session 37.

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Long-run engine additions (session 36 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-engine-longrun`. `workflows/longrun.py` + the `until_cancelled` loop mode and
  its reaper, `{{siblings.*}}`/`{{previous.output}}` with the `window`/`unseen`/`significant`/`full`/
  `hygiene`/`clamp` pipes, buffer-seal `wait`, adaptive-delay clamp, four ledger kinds, two new
  validator errors. 11957 tests.

- **DEVIATION (premise mismatch, resolved in place) — `join: any` does NOT cancel a watcher.** The
  plan says it does; measured, `container_outcome` checks for non-terminal children before the ANY
  rule, so the run never completes. That check is deliberate (a join must not fire early on a
  fan-out). So reaping is a separate pure rule, `reap_watchers`, rather than a change to join
  semantics. The plan's intent was buildable as written; only its stated mechanism was wrong.

- **DISCOVERY — three PRE-EXISTING engine defects, all live on `main`, all found by running the
  plan's flagship shape.** `_base_path` truncated at the last iteration marker instead of removing
  it, so a `wait` inside a loop body was looked up as its parent sequence and read as a gate ("gate
  timed out with no answer", for a template with no gate); `_loop_parent` required the path to END
  at `@N`, so a container-bodied loop never advanced and the run deadlocked after one iteration; and
  instance paths sorted as strings, so `body@10` preceded `body@2` and "oldest first" silently
  became wrong at the tenth cycle. Five SHIPPED templates use container-bodied loops. Fixing the
  second also required advancing the counter only when the whole body is terminal, derived through
  the scheduler's own `derive_state` rather than a second notion of completeness.

- **Validated end-to-end through the live engine:** the sibling view grew 2→4→8 across cycles as the
  worker produced, `previous.output` chained each cycle to its predecessor, the seen-set journaled
  one novel item per cycle, and `watcher_reaped` fired with `accompanied_work_complete` — the run
  COMPLETED in 10s instead of hanging forever.

- **NOT DONE:** the `transform(hygiene|unseen)` node preset (the pipes ship), LLM-summarize for
  oversized sibling payloads (deterministic truncate ships as the always-works fallback), and the
  run-continuity INJECTION SITE (the functions ship and are tested; wiring them onto the trigger
  record is session 37's recurring-run work).

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Consolidation + maintenance (session 37 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-knowledge-maintenance`. `knowledge/consolidation.py` (gate stack, deterministic
  pre-dedup, injectable-metric clustering, lineage caps, health checks, differential refresh, phantom
  hubs, lint cadence), the `knowledge-health` / `knowledge-consolidate` / `knowledge-gaps` providers,
  the three bundled templates, four config knobs. 12059 tests.

- **DEVIATION — the plan's 0.75 cluster threshold is an EMBEDDING number.** Measured: six human
  paraphrases of one fact score 0.12-0.36 pairwise on token Jaccard, so applying 0.75 to the
  embedder-free metric clustered nothing at all — a pass that ran, reported success, and consolidated
  zero items every time. The metric is now injectable and the DEFAULT THRESHOLD FOLLOWS THE METRIC
  (0.30 token / 0.75 cosine). Same defect class as session 35's cosine-cliff-vs-RRF bug.

- **DEVIATION — the plan's `<100-char` stub rule over-fires on real content.** An 83-character
  complete fact is not a stub, and six of those in a stub report trains the reader to ignore it. A
  stub is now short AND unspecific (no number, path, identifier or version).

- **DISCOVERY — five silent-failure bugs.** `items_fts` is keyed by ROWID not item id (every item
  read as unindexed; the reindex path had the mirror bug, writing entries no search can match);
  `content_hash()` is keyword-only and `items.item_type` is NOT NULL (the hand-rolled INSERT failed,
  so the write now goes through `knowledge-persist` — one writer per table); the persist provider
  silently DROPPED a `metadata=` argument, so the whole consolidation lineage never reached the row
  (now an explicit `lineage` key, not an open passthrough that could clobber `claims`); an embedder
  returning None must not be cached as an empty vector, because a 0.0 cosine silently means
  "unrelated" and that item would never cluster again; and phantom-hub detection is a set difference,
  not a search — the first draft passed `min_mentions` as a search query.

- **NOT DONE:** `gap-healing`'s drafting stage was not observed to completion live (a real Bedrock
  call still running after ~5 min, cancelled). Gap drafts are NOT routed to
  `learning.proposals.enqueue`: its `Kind` enum is CLOSED to six kinds and none is a knowledge draft,
  so filing there needs either a seventh kind or a mislabel — the extension belongs to the flywheel
  plan that owns the enum. The template persists a TTL'd `probe` tagged `proposal` instead.
  Contradiction-at-persist (§3.2) and typed-edge inference are session 38's.

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Contradiction + retrieval polish (session 38 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-contradiction`. `knowledge/contradiction.py` + `knowledge/session_brief.py`, the
  persist-time conflict pass with typed-edge writes, the `fenced_sources` binding filter, read-only
  conflict/relations routes, a `ConflictPanel` Knowledge view, two config knobs. 12123 tests.

- **DISCOVERY — a PRE-EXISTING split-brain in the knowledge store path.** The dashboard's `AppState`
  opens `<home>/workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`; every provider from sessions 35-38 composed
  `<home>/knowledge/knowledge.db`. Workflow-persisted knowledge landed in a second database the UI
  could never read — both writes "succeeded", both reads "worked", and the browsed store simply never
  contained what workflows wrote. Found only by driving the new conflicts route live after a workflow
  had written a conflict. Now ONE `knowledge_db_path()` in `store.py`, all four call sites through it,
  plus a test asserting no module composes the path itself.

- **DISCOVERY — six more silent-failure bugs.** The numeric conflict branch skipped the similarity
  gate (two unrelated properties of one subject read as a conflict); the prose-negation rule was
  UNREACHABLE behind the SPO gate, which requires the very decomposition those statements fail;
  plain Jaccard is the wrong instrument for a polarity comparison because negating ADDS tokens
  (measured 0.60 vs a 0.75 floor — added `core_similarity`); conflict details built from the
  normalized object lost the decimal point; the neighbour scan searched FTS for CLAIM text, which
  is not in the index, so it found nothing unless a claim echoed its item's title; and the edge
  write used RUN provenance as a row id, so the foreign key silently wrote nothing while the
  conflict record looked correct.

- **DEVIATION — no resolve endpoint, deliberately.** Both claims are always kept and the precedence
  ladder returns "" for two same-tier sources. Deciding a conflict is a judgement about the sources;
  a resolve route would invite the system to discard evidence irreversibly.

- **Validated live:** a workflow persisted two contradicting claims, the conflict was flagged at
  ingest with `prefer` favouring the user-origin decision, both API routes returned it (edges from
  both directions with resolved titles), and a second run read `{{brief.count}} = 2` with the
  decision ranked first and every item fenced.

- **NOT DONE:** the model-tier conflict pass is built and tested but unwired to a live model — that
  needs a `stage` node, since an LLM call inside an action provider is what the action/stage split
  exists to prevent. Background typed-edge inference beyond `contradicts` is parse-ready but unwired.
  The `coverage_gap` → persist-proposal loop and the template slate are session 39's.

- **2026-08-01/02 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Template slate + long-run validation (session 39, the
  plan's LAST session).** Branch `feature-wf2-knowledge-slate`. Four bundled templates
  (`knowledge-synthesis`, `rich-ingest`, `thesis-tracker`, `publish-article`) plus
  `tests/test_knowledge_longrun_validation.py` for the §8 criteria. 12186 tests. This closes the
  plan's six sessions (34-39).

- **DEVIATION — 4 of 12 slate items, and every omission is a missing PROVIDER.** `net.fetch` does not
  exist as an ACTION provider (the egress chokepoint is a library function, not dispatchable), which
  blocks `trending-repo-digest`, the dual-sink variant, `market-monitor` and `paper-ingest`; there is
  no calendar source for `meeting-prep` (the plan itself says the event is a template input until one
  exists, which makes it `knowledge-synthesis` with extra steps); and `quality-document`, the
  raw→rolling→one-pager tiering and `living-document` are artifact-centric variants of the
  compiled-truth pattern `thesis-tracker` already demonstrates. Building a template against a
  provider that cannot be dispatched would ship a spec that validates and then fails at run time —
  the exact failure `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` exists to prevent.

- **The long-run assertions were mutation-tested.** Removing the sibling window makes the view grow
  to 840 items over 168 cycles (the test caps at 20); removing the seen-set marking produces 95
  duplicate re-processings over 20 cycles. Both fail when their mechanism is removed. Idempotency is
  tested at FIFTY calls because a duplicate-on-Nth bug survives a two-call test.

- **Structural boundaries asserted rather than trusted:** `rich-ingest`'s providers must be exactly
  `{knowledge-persist, create-task}` (the KNOW-R18 memory boundary), every lens must carry
  `allow_failure`, each lens must persist under its own kind, and every slate template must render
  retrieved items through `| fenced_sources` rather than interpolating them raw.

- **Validated live:** all four templates in the Store; the zero-token retrieve correctly reported a
  coverage gap on an empty store; and `publish-article`'s tail driven against the REAL store — a
  `reference` stored, the approval recorded as a separate `kind: decision` citing it, a hybrid
  retrieve finding both, and `fenced_sources` rendering two numbered fenced blocks.

- **NOT DONE:** the synthesis STAGE was not observed to completion live (a real Bedrock subagent call
  still running after ~7 min, cancelled — the same latency session 37 hit). A minimal `infer` probe
  confirmed the model path works, so this is latency, not a defect. Criterion #10 (heuristic
  extraction with NO provider bound) is unverified: it needs a provider-less environment.
