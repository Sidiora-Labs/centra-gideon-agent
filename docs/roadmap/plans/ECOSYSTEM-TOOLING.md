# ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/ET.md`](../atomic/ET.md) as 8 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Ecosystem Tooling — Scaffold, Registry, Exemplars

**Status:** DESIGNED — deepened 2026-07-18 with code recon (initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18; owner: "yes, please plan for this")
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Wave:** 2 (S1-2: scaffold + registry data tier) + 3 (S3-4: exemplars, bounties, registry surface)
**Depends on:** OSS-OPERATIONS (front-door policy), PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY S1-3 (manifest self-description), CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING S2 (apps-repo CI the template inherits), plan 32 (manifest gains `cli.*`/`loggerRoots` — scaffold emits them).
**Scope:** collapse app-author time-to-first-run to minutes and give Gideon-native apps a discovery surface. **Soul guardrail:** the registry starts as **data in a git repo** the Store consumes — no registry service, no accounts, no upload pipeline. The scanner-gated install path remains the only install path; the registry adds discovery, never a bypass. Scaffold output must pass the apps-repo CI *as generated* — a template that needs fixing is a defect.

---

> 📎 **The first-party app suite in [PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY](PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY.md) §7 (#68) ARE this plan's exemplars** — added 2026-08-05. A comparable product suite spans ~11 first-party product apps (Code Review, Research Lab, Design Critique, PPTX/Papyrus, Notes, Issue Radar, Ops, Spec Builder, Companion); #68 §7 designs Gideon equivalents as a phased program, one PR each. This plan's scaffold generates their skeletons and its exemplar list should record them as they ship — they prove the platform far better than the four throwaway exemplars in T3.1. Coordinate: #68 §7 builds the apps; this plan builds the scaffold/registry they're built with.

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18)

- CLI uses argparse subparsers (`cli.py:205+`, existing two-level pattern e.g. `cron`/`spawn`/`security` subcommands) — `gideon app new` slots in cleanly.
- Sources API is live: git sources (`/api/apps/sources`) list-without-clone, shallow-clone-at-install behind the scanner; local sources (`/api/apps/local-sources`). A registry = **one well-known default git source** entry — near-zero core change.
- The worked example (`third-party-apps/demo-dashboard`) exercises every platform surface (backend, UI, storage, api/events/cron/agent permissions, MCP server); the app-creation guide is 322 lines. Manifest schema (`apps/manifest.py`) validates name/semver; capability types: model/search/tool/channel/action/skills-marketplace/inbox-source/backend+UI.

## Design

- **Scaffold:** `gideon app new <name> --type <capability>` — interactive when flags absent; emits `app.json` (valid, incl. plan-32 fields), provider stub for the chosen type (each type's stub = minimal compilable implementation of its ABC with one TODO-free example method), `test_provider.py` (passing, stub-based like the first-party pattern), `README.md` (front-matter template), `LICENSE` (MIT prefilled). Types map to real sdk contracts — the generator's type table is **derived from the provider registry**, not hardcoded (self-description tenet). Also `--from-template` fetching the template repo for fork-and-go users.
- **Template repo (`gideon/app-template`):** the scaffold's `--type tool` output committed + apps-repo CI preconfigured + a README walking the author from clone to installed-in-Store in minutes.
- **Registry (`gideon/registry`):** `registry.json` — `[{name, repo, types, permissions_declared, license, maintainer, added, last_validated}]`; PR-based listing; CI validation on PRs: manifest fetch+parse, repo exists, license present, scanner dry-run verdict recorded into the PR (never auto-blocking listing on `warning` — the verdict is *displayed*; `dangerous` blocks listing). Store integration: the registry repo URL ships as a default git source (config seed + Settings toggle to remove it); listings render with the same consent surface as any source.
- **Exemplars (org repos, scaffold-generated):** `watched-source-github` (a watched-source provider — coordinates with WATCHED-SOURCES contract timing), `action-home-assistant` (action provider calling HA webhooks), `inbox-github-notifications` (inbox source), `channel-null` (the guide's teaching channel, conformance-kit-passing). Each: small, real, forkable, listed in the registry.
- **Bounty board:** labeled issues (`bounty`) per wanted app (channels from plan 40 T7.3, providers, sources) with the scaffold + guide + conformance links; showcase channel in the community surface.
- **Registry surface (S4):** static generation on gideon.dev from `registry.json` — cards show name, types, **declared permissions and last scan verdict pre-install** (publishing the consent surface).

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### C1 — Scaffold (`src/gideon/cli_app_new.py`, wired via §3.10 subparser)
`gideon app new <name> [--type <t>] [--from-template]`. The type table is **derived from the provider registry** (enumerate capability types + their ABC module at runtime — not hardcoded, self-description tenet). Each type emits: `app.json` (valid, incl. plan-32 `cli.*`/`loggerRoots` when relevant), a provider stub implementing that type's ABC minimally, a passing stub-based `test_provider.py` (the `sys.modules` stub pattern, §CI), `README.md`, `LICENSE`. **Generated output must pass apps-repo CI as generated** (test `test_app_scaffold.py`).

### C2 — `registry.json` schema (in the `gideon/registry` repo)
```jsonc
{
  "apps": [
    { "name":"…", "repo":"https://github.com/…", "types":["search"],
      "permissions_declared":["network"], "license":"MIT",
      "maintainer":"handle", "added":"<ISO>", "last_validated":"<ISO>",
      "last_scan_verdict":"clean|warning|dangerous" }   // from a scanner dry-run at validation
  ]
}
```
PR validation workflow: manifest fetch+parse (core `apps/manifest.py`), repo liveness, license present, scanner dry-run verdict recorded; `dangerous` blocks listing, `warning` lists-with-display. The registry repo URL ships as a **default git source** (existing `/api/apps/sources` mechanism, §3.8 — no new install path; scanner gate unchanged at install).

**AS BUILT (`ET-3`, 2026-08-18) — `scratch/registry/`, three deltas from the sketch above.** (1) The row schema is **closed** (`additionalProperties: false`) and `last_validated`/`last_scan_verdict` are **CI-owned**: a listing PR omits them and anything it does supply is overwritten from the run that actually happened. (2) `registry.schema.json` is **generated** from the Python constants (`validate_registry.py --emit-schema`) rather than hand-maintained, so its `types` enum tracks core's `PROVIDER_TYPES` on regeneration; `test_registry_validation.py` reds on drift. (3) Two checks were added beyond the four listed: the row's `types`/`permissions_declared` must equal what the fetched manifest declares (those two fields ARE the pre-install consent surface S4 publishes, so a row that under-declares lies on the user's behalf), and a symlink resolving outside the clone blocks before anything reads the tree (the validator quotes matched evidence into a public PR comment).

### Integration points
- **Calls:** provider registry (type table), `apps/manifest.py` (validation), `SkillScanner` dry-run (verdict), the sources-seeding path.
- **Consumed by:** 40 (a `channel` scaffold template + bounties), 47 (registry records signer identity per listing), 36 (registry surface on the site).
- **Depends on:** 32 (manifest `cli.*`/`loggerRoots` fields the scaffold emits), 37 (front-door policy), PLATFORM-LEGIBILITY (manifest self-description).

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — Scaffold + template

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | Type table derived from the provider registry (enumerate capability types + their ABC/module mapping programmatically; record the mapping source in the Execution log) | `src/gideon/cli_app_new.py` (new), wired via `cli.py` subparser pattern | `gideon app new --list-types` prints the derived table; adding a provider type upstream appears without editing the generator |
| T1.2 | Generators per type: manifest (+plan-32 fields), provider stub implementing the type's contract minimally, passing stub-based `test_provider.py`, README, LICENSE | `cli_app_new.py` + `src/gideon/templates/app/` data files | for EVERY type: generate → `pytest <dir>` passes → local-source install succeeds → provider registers (scripted loop in a test) |
| T1.3 | Generated-output CI conformance: a core test generates each type into tmp and runs the apps-repo checks (manifest validate, sdk-boundary, tests) against it | `tests/test_app_scaffold.py` | scaffold drift = red test |
| T1.4 | `docs/app-creation-guide` (apps repo) gains the scaffold quickstart at the top ("minutes to first run"); template repo content emitted + README | apps repo guide; `gideon/app-template` repo content (prepared in-tree under `scratch/`, pushed by owner task 1) | quickstart tested verbatim; template repo content complete |
| V1 | Validation: stranger-shaped run — scaffold a `search` app, implement one real method (wikipedia-style), install via Store local source, use it in chat; time it (<30 min target) | — | timed run recorded |

### Session 2 — Registry data tier

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | `registry.json` schema + validation script (manifest fetch/parse, repo liveness, license, scanner dry-run verdict capture) + PR workflow running it | `gideon/registry` repo content (schema, script, CI, CONTRIBUTING-for-listings, delisting policy per Design) | a valid sample PR passes; a dangerous-verdict fixture blocks with the reason |
| T2.2 | Default-source seeding: registry URL ships as a default git source (seed into `app-sources.json` on first run behind a config flag; Settings shows it as removable-default) | sources seeding site (locate first-run seeding in `apps/` bootstrapping), Settings sources UI | fresh home lists registry apps in Store; removing the source persists |
| T2.3 | Store card provenance line: for registry-sourced apps, show maintainer + last_validated from registry metadata (data already in the catalog payload path — extend the git-source catalog listing) | `apps/source.py`/catalog path, Store card component | registry cards show provenance; local/first-party cards unchanged |
| V2 | Validation: list→install→use a registry app end to end; verify the scan gate still runs at install (deliberate warning-fixture app shows consent) | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Exemplars + bounties (Wave 3)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | Build the four exemplars per Design (scaffold-generated, then minimally implemented; each ≤300 LOC target, README-led) | four org repos (content prepared in-tree, pushed by owner task 1) | each installs from its git URL through the Store; registry-listed |
| T3.2 | Bounty board: labeled issues from the wants-list (channels + providers + sources), each linking scaffold/guide/conformance; showcase thread seeded | GitHub issues | ≥6 bounties live |
| V3 | Validation: fork-simulate one exemplar (clone, rename via scaffold rename helper if built, else manual), install — the third-party path proven end to end again post-registry | — | holds |

### Session 4 — Registry surface (Wave 3)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4.1 | Static registry pages on gideon.dev generated from `registry.json` (cards: name/types/permissions/verdict/maintainer; per-app page with README fetch) | site repo (plan 36's sync pipeline extension) | site lists registry; permissions + verdict visible pre-install; rebuild picks up registry changes |
| V4 | Validation: a registry PR merge appears on the site after rebuild; card data matches Store consent surface | — | holds |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **Create the org repos** (`app-template`, `registry`, four exemplar repos) and push the prepared content (executor prepares everything in-tree; you create+push — or grant the session push rights and skip this). ~20 min.
2. **Approve the delisting policy** wording (what gets removed and how appeals work) — it's a community-governance statement.
3. **Seed the first bounty rewards decision:** recognition-only vs small monetary bounties (recognition-only recommended at this stage; monetary bounties need payment logistics you may not want).
4. When exemplar `action-home-assistant` is validated: a Home Assistant instance (yours if you run one; else mark that exemplar community-validated).

## Risks & open questions

- **Registry trust-washing risk:** a listing must never read as an endorsement — card copy says "community-listed, scanned at install" explicitly; verdict display is the honest differentiator.
- **Open:** scaffold rename/refactor helper (`app new --from <existing>`) — nice-to-have; DISCOVERY-file if demand appears.

## Execution log

- **2026-08-17 — ET-2 (T1.4) DONE.** Template repo content + the guide quickstart + `app new
  --from-template`. Template content staged at `scratch/app-template/` (the `--type tool`
  output at the repo root, a hand-written clone-to-installed `README.md`, a root-level variant
  of the apps-repo CI's four jobs, `.gitignore`); the apps-guide insert is staged at
  `scratch/apps-guide-quickstart.md` with its own insertion instructions. `scratch/` is outside
  `testpaths` and outside `make lint`'s targets, so it does not join the core build. **Owner
  push still required** (Owner task 1) — see `scratch/README.md`.
- **DISCOVERY — the quickstart was wrong twice until it was run verbatim.** Step 6 claimed
  `GET /api/apps/{name}` returns top-level `enabled` and `provider` keys; it returns
  `installed.enabled` and `manifest.provider`. And `gideon doctor` prints the section
  under the app's *name* (`my-tool`), not its displayName. Both were found by executing the
  text, not by reading it. Measured after correction: **2.4 s wall clock, steps 1-6**, from an
  empty directory against a freshly-homed gateway (`--list-types` → generate → pytest → token →
  install+enable → verify). The plan's "<30 min" target is for V1's stranger-shaped run with a
  real method implemented; this number is first-run only.
- **DISCOVERY — this repo's pre-commit hook reformats the staged template.** `black` runs over
  every staged `.py`, including `scratch/app-template/`, and rewrote the generated
  `CONTRACT_METHODS = ('a', 'b')` to double quotes — silently making the staged template differ
  from generator output. Fixed at the source: the generator now emits double quotes
  (`f'"{m}"'`, not `repr(m)`), so scaffold output is black-clean by construction. A template
  that needs reformatting is the same class of defect as one that needs fixing.
- **DEVIATION — `--from-template` takes no NAME.** It fetches the template verbatim into
  `<dir>/app-template`, and refuses a NAME with a message pointing at `--type tool`. Renaming
  properly spans five files (manifest name/displayName/loggerRoots, the provider class + logger
  root + `name`/`display_name` bodies, the test's expectations, the README title, the LICENSE
  holder) — that is the rename helper this plan's Risks section deliberately leaves open, and
  a partial rename would ship a manifest `name` that disagrees with the provider's `.name`
  property, which every per-type registry keys on. The template README documents the four-edit
  rename instead.
- **MEASURED — the live fetch is UNPROVEN, and honestly so.**
  `https://codeload.github.com/gideon/app-template/tar.gz/refs/heads/main` answers **HTTP
  404** today, and `app new --from-template` refuses it fail-closed
  (`error: template fetch returned HTTP 404 (expected 200)`). So the URL, the host allowlist and
  the real TLS transport are all exercised against the real host; only the repo's *content* is
  missing. Extraction is proven end-to-end against a local tarball and a loopback HTTP server.
  Nothing in core changes when the owner pushes.
- **FALSIFICATION — the traversal tests initially passed for the wrong reason.** Disabling the
  `..` name check by hand left both traversal tests GREEN: the post-canonicalisation containment
  check was firing and emitting a message that matched. The two refusals now say different
  things ("escapes the target" vs "resolves outside the target") and
  `test_containment_refuses_even_if_the_name_check_is_bypassed` bypasses the first layer so the
  second is proven live on its own. With BOTH layers disabled, `../../PWNED.txt` really escapes
  two directories out of the target — measured, not assumed.
## Execution log

- **2026-08-17 — DONE (`ET-1`): `gideon app new` scaffold with a registry-derived type table** (#1553).
  `--list-types` prints 18 types read at runtime from `manifest._providers_section()` -> `PROVIDER_TYPES` +
  the provider registry — the same derivation the agent manifest publishes, so an upstream capability type
  appears without editing the generator. That is tested, not asserted:
  `test_an_upstream_type_appears_without_editing_the_generator` injects `fake_capability` and requires it to
  both list AND scaffold; hard-coding the list reds it, and `cli_app_new.py` contains zero type-list
  literals. Thirteen types resolve a contract off `gideon.sdk.*`; five publish no SDK ABC (`agent`,
  `duty_gate`, `notification`, `task`, `workflow`) and are labelled `- (duck-typed stub)` rather than
  emitting a deep-core import that would break the app boundary. The per-type loop is 18/18 on all four
  legs — generate -> `pytest <dir>` (7 tests each) -> local-source install -> provider registers with
  `error == ""` — and `tests/test_app_scaffold.py` runs the **apps repo's own three CI jobs** read out of
  its `ci.yml`, so scaffold drift reds. `duty_gate` genuinely failed the register leg first
  (`must expose an async on_duty(now, ctx)`) and was fixed by carrying that requirement in a table read off
  the handler's own refusal, not by excluding the type. Generated stubs assert `__abstractmethods__` empty,
  so a scaffolded provider is instantiable rather than merely parseable. Gate: lint EXIT=0, mypy clean on
  903 files, 137 passed + 1 pre-existing skip, `manifest_reference` no-diff. Five falsifications, none green.
- **2026-08-17 — V1 + DISCOVERY (`ET-1`): the generated README's own install snippet did not work.**
  Timed stranger walkthrough: **6 seconds** end to end, run twice. The first drive returned
  `{"error": "Token required"}` twice because the template used `Authorization: Bearer $GIDEON_TOKEN`,
  and the gateway accepts `Bearer` only for **app-scoped narrowing** tokens —
  `dashboard/token_auth.py:977-986`; the owner token comes from `?token=` or the `pc_token_<port>` cookie
  (verified in code during ship review, not taken on report). The template now uses `?token=` plus the
  follow-up `enable` call, and the final run executed the snippet **verbatim from the generated README**.
  A scaffold whose own README fails is worse than no scaffold, so this is recorded as the finding V1 exists
  to produce.
- **2026-08-17 — NOTE.** This plan had no `## Execution log` section before today (one of 7 of 70); the
  section was created with `ET-1`'s entry rather than the entry being filed elsewhere.
- **2026-08-18 — DONE (`ET-3`, T2.1): the registry data tier, staged as registry-repo content in
  `scratch/registry/`.** Follows `ET-2`'s convention (`scratch/` is tracked, outside `testpaths` and
  outside `make lint`'s targets, and nothing in core imports it), so the owner copies the directory to a
  new `gideon/registry` root and pushes. Twelve files: `registry.json` (empty until `ET-6`),
  a **generated** `registry.schema.json`, `validate_registry.py`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the listing policy),
  `DELISTING.md`, `requirements.txt` (`gideon==0.1.3`, pinned so the scanner rule set — i.e. what the
  registry accepts — cannot change without someone choosing it), three workflows and three app fixtures.
  **All three behavioural clauses are driven, not asserted.** The validator reaches a repo exactly one way —
  `git ls-remote` for liveness, `git clone --depth 1` to fetch — and git treats `file://` and `https://`
  identically, so 44 committed tests build real one-commit git repositories from the fixture trees and run
  the REAL fetcher offline. Nothing is stubbed, skipped or xfailed. Measured: valid → exit 0, verdict
  `clean`, `rows_validated: 1`; dangerous → exit 1 with `scanner_dangerous:destructive_root` naming
  `scripts/install.sh` and quoting `rm -rf / --no-preserve-root`; warning → **exit 0, `blocking == []`**,
  verdict `warning` (not `low` — scanning at `community` tier deliberately, because `official`/`trusted`
  would report a softer verdict than the user's own install gate) with `scanner_warning:curl_network` in
  `display` and "shown, not blocking" in the PR body. **`file://` requires an explicit
  `--allow-file-repos`** that none of the three workflows passes (pinned by a test), so the offline
  affordance is not a production hole.
- **2026-08-18 — DEVIATION + DISCOVERY (`ET-3`): three additions the plan did not ask for, each because
  the four listed checks left a real hole.** (1) **Row↔manifest agreement.** S4 publishes `types` +
  `permissions_declared` as a pre-install consent surface, so validating the manifest while trusting the
  row's copy of it would let a listing under-declare permissions on the user's behalf; both are now derived
  from the fetched manifest (`Permissions.to_dict()` keys — so the two permission fields a sibling agent
  added to `manifest.py` today are picked up with no edit here) and exact equality is required.
  (2) **Escaping-symlink refusal.** The validator quotes matched scanner evidence into a **public** PR
  comment, so a committed symlink to `/etc/passwd` would have had its contents read and echoed by a CI
  runner. Blocked before anything reads the tree, for absolute AND `../`-climbing targets. (3) **Scheduled
  re-validation** (`revalidate-listings.yml`): `DELISTING.md`'s grounds are all detected by re-running the
  validator, and a delisting policy with no detection mechanism is inert doctrine. **The discovery came
  from a vacuity assertion**: the "an internal symlink is left alone" control initially reported
  `repo_symlink_escape`, because an ABSOLUTE in-repo symlink stops being in-repo the moment the repo is
  cloned elsewhere — correct behaviour, wrong fixture. The fixture now uses a relative target and the
  escape test covers both shapes. A live hand-drive also surfaced a copy defect: GitHub answers a
  nonexistent repo with `Authentication failed`, so the verbatim git message sent a contributor who
  mistyped a repo name hunting for a credentials problem; the reason now says what actually happened
  (asserted at the call site, with a vacuity case proving an ordinary git error does NOT get the hint).
- **2026-08-18 — NOTE (`ET-3`): the listing policy is written down for the first time, and is
  OWNER-CONFIRMABLE.** `ET-3`'s declared dep is OSS-OPERATIONS' front-door / community-listing policy,
  which is not separately shipped, so `CONTRIBUTING.md` states the adopted policy explicitly and marks
  its provenance: four rules come from this plan's Design (§Registry), and the rest — a closed row schema,
  exact row↔manifest agreement, unique kebab-case names equal to the manifest's, `https`-only repo URLs
  with no userinfo and no explicit port, and the maintainer expectations — are stated there so the script
  implements a written policy rather than an implied one. `DELISTING.md` splits grounds into immediate
  (`dangerous` verdict, malware/impersonation) and 14-day-notice (repo gone across two consecutive weekly
  runs, manifest stops validating, license removed, row↔manifest divergence), and says plainly that
  delisting stops NEW discovery and **uninstalls nothing**. Both documents are owner-confirmable, not
  owner-confirmed. **Not proven, and unprovable until the repo exists:** whether GitHub runs the three
  workflows. Their action versions mirror core's own `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as observed today
  (`checkout@v7`, `setup-uv@v7`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8`, `github-script@v9`), and the
  fork-token split (validation holds a read-only token and writes an artifact; a `workflow_run` sibling
  posts the comment) is copied from core's `ci.yml`/`pr-feedback.yml` pair for the same reason — a fork PR
  gets a read-only token whatever `permissions:` asks for. The live `https` legs WERE driven by hand once:
  `github.com/octocat/Hello-World` cloned and then blocked `manifest_missing` with verdict "not reached"
  (a `None` verdict is never read as clean), and a nonexistent repo blocked `repo_unreachable` without ever
  hanging on a credential prompt — which is the no-prompt git environment working.
- **2026-08-18 — PARTIAL (`ET-4`, T2.2): the registry ships as a SEEDED, removable default git source.**
  `apps.registry_source_enabled` (new `apps` config section) gates a one-time seed of
  `https://github.com/Gideon/registry.git` into `apps/app-sources.json` at gateway start
  (`_app_sources_seed_startup` → `catalog.seed_default_git_sources()`). **Deliberately NOT added to
  `_DEFAULT_GIT_SOURCES`:** that tuple is folded into every read of `list_git_sources()`, so a "removed"
  member is back on the next read — the mechanism the done-clause "removing the source persists" rules out.
  The seed instead writes one ordinary row plus a `"seeded": ["registry"]` marker; the marker OUTLIVES the
  removal, which is what stops the next start re-seeding. Every source write path round-trips the marker
  (dropping it from `_write_sources` resurrects a removed default — falsified live: proc A seed → remove →
  proc B re-seeds). Drove a real gateway on an isolated home: fresh start seeds; `DELETE /api/apps/sources`
  removes it; a genuinely new process on the same home lists only the bundled default. Flag off on a fresh
  home creates **no** `app-sources.json` at all; `PATCH apps.registry_source_enabled=true` then a restart
  seeds. Five wiring points: dataclass+`_meta` (`AppsConfig`), `load()`, `to_dict()`, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`
  (`apps.registry_source_enabled`), and a Settings › Apps toggle. `config-baseline.json` regenerated (the
  `config-baseline` gate reds otherwise — one added path, nothing else).
- **2026-08-18 — UNMET clause (`ET-4`): "a fresh dev home lists registry apps in the Store" — TWO
  independent gaps, neither of them this atom's.** (1) `scratch/registry/registry.json` ships `{"apps": []}`
  until `ET-6`. (2) **Measured, and cheaper to fix than it looks:** core enumerates a source's listings from
  an index file named **`app-registry.json`** (`catalog._REGISTRY_FILENAME`), while `ET-3` publishes
  **`registry.json`** — but the *shapes already agree* where it matters. `_parse_registry` accepts
  `{"apps": [...]}` and `RegistryPointer.from_dict` needs `name` + `repo`, both of which are REQUIRED in
  `registry.schema.json`. So the whole gap is the filename. Deliberately NOT closed here: widening the
  accepted index name changes listing behaviour for *every* git and local source as a side effect of a
  seeding atom, `T2.3` owns reading registry metadata into Store cards (and wants the richer
  `maintainer`/`last_validated` fields, which `RegistryPointer` drops), and with the registry empty the new
  path would ship unexercised. Recorded so `T2.3`/`ET-6` can take the cheap route knowingly.
- **2026-08-18 — DISCOVERY (`ET-4`): a polarity helper on this flag would have been DEAD CODE.**
  First cut read the flag with `_expose_flag` (fail-closed, "any flag whose True opens a network surface")
  for present-but-garbage values. A test proved it unreachable: `load()`'s schema type-gate already replaces
  a non-bool with the field's **dataclass default** (`_apply_field_default`, the "using default" warning)
  before the field mapping runs, so the helper could only ever see a real bool. Consequence, stated in code
  and pinned by a rail: a corrupted value resolves to the SHIPPED posture (registry **on**), not to off —
  that is the platform-wide config policy, not a choice of this field.
- **2026-08-18 — DEVIATION (`ET-4`): fixed a swallowed write in the sources UI, in scope.** The Store's git-
  source rows rendered a Remove button on the BUNDLED default too, where the backend's DELETE is a no-op by
  construction — click it and the row stays. The catalog envelope now reports `defaultGitSources` (rows
  Gideon shipped → "Default" label) and `builtinGitSources` (the unremovable subset → no remove
  control), mirroring the `firstPartySources` pattern already used for local sources. `remove_git_source`
  semantics are UNCHANGED (a bundled default is still a silent no-op there, and its existing test still
  passes) — the fix is that the UI no longer offers the button.
- **2026-08-18 — NOTE (`ET-4`): the scanner gate is unchanged, proven behaviourally.** No new install path:
  seeding only edits the source LIST. A registry-listed app with dangerous content, installed via the exact
  `pointer` the Store card hands over, is refused with `Verdict.DANGEROUS` even with `confirm=True`; replacing
  the gate's `default_scanner.scan(...)` with a clean report makes that install succeed and reds the test.
