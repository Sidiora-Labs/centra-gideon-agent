# PROMPT-CACHE-SUBSTRATE

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/PCS.md`](../atomic/PCS.md) as 8 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Prompt-Cache Substrate — One Middleware Seam That Makes Every Turn Cheaper

**Status:** DESIGNED (rev 2) — created 2026-07-29; **redesigned 2026-07-30** after a code audit falsified rev 1's central mechanism (owner ask: capability gap analysis; owner direction: "an elaborated base middleware type subsystem that just plugs into the right location and provides all the places with prompt caching benefits"; owner ruling 2026-07-29: "Redesign the plan now and implement when it should be implemented in natural order of roadmap items wherever it fits")
**Created:** 2026-07-29
**Wave:** 2 (S1: wire-order repair + prefix stability; S2: the marker + provider adoption; S3: the measurement surface)
**Depends on:** nothing hard. Builds entirely on shipped seams: `ModelProvider.complete()` (`llm/base.py:150`), `ProviderCapability` (`llm/capabilities.py:47`), `pricing.estimate_cost` (which ALREADY prices `cache_read`/`cache_write` — `pricing.py:63-83`), and `LLMEvent.cache_creation_tokens`/`cache_read_tokens` (`llm/events.py:63-64`). Coordinates with COST-AND-TOKEN-OBSERVABILITY (its savings readout is this plan's proof surface — that plan owns the UI, this plan owns the numbers reaching it), CONTEXT-ECONOMY (DONE — compaction rewrites history, a cache-invalidation event this plan must reason about, §C5), MODEL-USE-CASES-V2 (per-use-case chains resolve different providers; caching is declared per provider *type*, so a chain fallback must not assume the cache), CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES (the sibling plan that owns tool-schema stability and failure retention — **this plan owns ONLY the cache marker + prefix/wire ordering**; do not implement that plan's items here).

**Scope:** Gideon prices cached tokens in `model_pricing.json` for 26 models and *declares* `cache_creation_tokens`/`cache_read_tokens` on `LLMEvent` — but **never asks any provider to cache anything, and never reads a cache number off any response**. Verified 2026-07-30: zero `cache_control` blocks in core and in all first-party apps; zero `cachePoint` in the apps repo. A known production-agent position is that KV-cache hit rate is the single most important production-agent metric (a measured ~10× delta on a ~100:1 input:output ratio); another report cites a 72% inference cost reduction from Bedrock prompt caching. This plan builds **one provider-agnostic middleware seam** that (a) declares cache *intent* on the message list in a vendor-neutral shape, (b) is translated to each vendor's wire format inside that vendor's own adapter (never in core), (c) makes the assembled prefix actually reachable and byte-stable enough to hit, and (d) reports hit-rate + saved dollars so the win is measurable rather than asserted.

**Soul guardrails:** (1) **provider-agnostic marker, vendor translation at the edge** — core emits a neutral hint on message dicts; the word `cache_control` appears ONLY inside a vendor adapter, never in `agents/`, `context.py`, or any core caller (the provider boundary is lint-enforced); (2) **byte-identical when off** — with caching unavailable or disabled, the request that reaches the wire must be byte-for-byte what ships today (a test asserts this), so a non-caching provider is never penalised; (3) **never trade correctness for a cache hit** — no content is reordered, dropped, or deferred to improve hit rate beyond the two deliberate, enumerated relocations in §C2/§C3; if a stability change would alter *what the model is told*, it is out of scope; (4) **measure before claiming** — no session may be marked complete on an asserted win; a provider-reported cache read is the only acceptable evidence (§S3).

Class **A** for the marker/middleware and the wire-order repair (no persisted state), class **B** for the one new config section + the cache-stats persistence that COST-AND-TOKEN-OBSERVABILITY owns — pre-LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE, so those land as **plain clean breaks under the pre-1.0 banner** (tolerant reads, no gate/migration; CHANGELOG entry).

---

## Why this plan was redesigned (read this before the Design — rev 1 would not have worked)

Rev 1 was written from a reading of the call sites; a full audit of the **wire** path found three defects. Two were false premises, one was a latent data-loss bug the plan would have introduced. All four findings below are reproduced from code, with the reproduction recorded so an executor need not re-derive them.

**F1 — FATAL to rev 1's mechanism: the "stable head" is not the head of the wire request.** Rev 1's §C4 defined the cacheable span as `messages[0..k]` where `k` is the assembled-context *user* message, and marked a breakpoint at its end. But `_translate_messages` (`anthropic.py:108-183`) **hoists every `system`-role message out of the list and concatenates them into the top-level `system=` parameter** (`anthropic.py:183`), which Anthropic places **ahead of `messages[0]`** in the served prompt. The native loop appends exactly one `system` message: the per-turn `turn_note` (`runtime.py:711-712`), which carries the tool catalog and group stubs inside it (joined at `runtime.py:930`). Reproduced:

```
$ python -c "from gideon.llm.anthropic import _translate_messages; ..."
system= param -> 'VOLATILE_TURN_NOTE'
messages    -> [{'role':'user','content':'ASSEMBLED_CONTEXT_PREFIX'}, ...]
```

So a **volatile, per-turn string is the first thing the model sees**, ahead of the entire stable prefix. A cache breakpoint at the end of `messages[0]` covers a span whose *prefix* changes every turn — and prompt caching matches on an exact prefix, so **the hit rate would have been zero while every test passed**. This is the exact failure mode rev 1's own risk section called "silent no-win," and it was structural, not incidental. §C2 fixes the wire order; it is now S1's first task and the precondition for the marker having any value.

**F2 — a latent bug rev 1 would have SHIPPED: moving the date to the tail puts it in the truncation window.** Rev 1's §C3 moved `[CURRENT DATE]` to the **end** of the assembled block. But `build_session_context` hard-truncates from the **end**: `context = context[:_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS]` with `_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS = 165_000` (`context.py:120, 992-1002`). A user with large memory/skills/thread history would silently lose the date line entirely — the model would no longer know what day it is, a correctness regression traded for a cache hit, which guardrail (3) forbids. §C3 keeps the relocation (it is the right idea) but makes the date line **truncation-immune** by appending it after the truncation step, and states the invariant as a test.

**F3 — a false premise about existing plumbing.** Rev 1 asserted "cache token accounting is ALREADY plumbed end-to-end … the measurement machinery needs no new math." Half true, and the wrong half was load-bearing. The **consumers** exist (`stats.py:42-84`, `pricing.py:63-83`, `chat_runner.py:2530-2574`, `guardrails/model_call.py:296-297`, `acp/adapter.py:31-32`); there is **no producer**. Neither adapter reads a cache field off a response: `anthropic.py` parses only `usage.input_tokens` / `usage.output_tokens` (`:302-309`, `:457-464`) and never constructs `LLMEvent` with either cache argument. So `cache_read_tokens` is **always 0**, `estimate_cost` always applies a zero cache term, and the stats counters can only ever increment by 0. Reading the two `usage.cache_*_input_tokens` fields off the Anthropic response is **new work this plan owns** — it is now T3.1, and without it the whole plan is unfalsifiable.

**F4 — a false premise about the capability precedent.** Rev 1 said `prompt_cache` should copy `structured_output` "verbatim … same apps-declare mechanism." The field exists as described (`capabilities.py:63`, default `NONE`, with the documented rationale) — but per AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS' execution log its apps-side half shipped as a **documented DEVIATION**: core ships the descriptor and apps declare it through `BrandedProviderSpec`, a deliberate cross-repo seam. It is a valid precedent for the *shape* of a graded default-off capability, and this plan copies that shape. It is **not** evidence that the apps-side declaration is free: that half is a coordinated apps-repo change, and it is listed as an owner task rather than assumed. Do not delete or "clean up" `structured_output` on the belief that it is dead code — it is not.

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-30 — verified against code, every claim has a citation)

**What already exists:**
- **The stateless completion seam is the right insertion point.** `ModelProvider.complete(messages: list[dict], *, tools, model, reasoning_effort)` (`llm/base.py:150`). The native loop owns history and passes the entire message list every turn (`agents/native/runtime.py:747`). One decoration of that list reaches every native turn, every provider, with no per-provider caller changes.
- **The pricing half is real and needs no new math.** `pricing.estimate_cost(..., cache_read_tokens=0, cache_creation_tokens=0)` (`pricing.py:63-64`) applies `cache_read` and `cache_write` rates (`pricing.py:82-83`); `model_pricing.json` carries real per-model rates for 26 models (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.6`: `in 3.0 / cache_read 0.3 / cache_write 3.75` — a 10× read discount). What is missing is the **producer** (F3), not the arithmetic.
- **The capability-declaration shape to copy.** `ProviderCapability.structured_output: StructuredOutput = StructuredOutput.NONE` (`capabilities.py:63`), with the in-code rationale "Defaults to NONE so a provider that doesn't declare it gets the universal … path — the correct, safe behavior for every provider until it opts into native enforcement." `prompt_cache` copies this **shape** (graded enum, default-off, apps declare via `BrandedProviderSpec`) — see F4 for what that precedent does and does not license.
- **The Anthropic adapter is the reference translation site.** `llm/anthropic.py:393::complete` builds `request_kwargs`, calls `_translate_messages(messages)` and `_translate_tools(tools)`. It already demonstrates a provider-specific request-shape decision made locally (the `thinking` budget clamp + `temperature` drop, `:428-437`).
- **The OpenAI adapter needs NO marker** — OpenAI-family prompt caching is automatic on a stable prefix (no per-request opt-in). Its entire win comes from §C2 + §C3, which makes the ordering half of this plan load-bearing rather than cosmetic.

**The obstacles (each verified, each addressed by a numbered contract):**
1. **The wire order defeats a naive prefix marker** — F1 above. Addressed by §C2.
2. **A minute-precision timestamp sits at position 2 of the assembled prefix.** `context.py:773` — `parts.append(f"[CURRENT DATE] {now.strftime('%A, %Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z')}\n\n")`, immediately after `render_snippet_block("critical-rules")` (`context.py:764`). Because `%H:%M` changes every minute, **every new session assembles a different prefix**, so cross-session reuse is impossible even where a provider would offer it free. This is precisely the well-known anti-pattern that is the canonical cache killer. Addressed by §C3 — with F2's truncation clause.
3. **There is no stable `system` message today.** There is exactly ONE `system`-role message the native loop ever appends: the per-turn `turn_note` at `runtime.py:712`. It is the joined `notes` list from `_prepare_turn_tools` (`runtime.py:930`), so the group-change note, the tool catalog and the inactive-group stubs all ride inside that single volatile message. The assembled session context ships as the **first `user` message** (`runtime.py:707`). So the cacheable span is "the assembled-context message", not "the system prompt"; and after §C2 it is "the stable system block **plus** that message". An executor who assumes a stable system prompt already exists will build the wrong thing.
4. **Compaction rewrites history wholesale.** `_maybe_compact()` (`runtime.py:739` → `:1292`) can replace `self._messages`. Addressed by §C5's generation bump.

**Honest limits of the win (state these in the PR, do not oversell):**
- The per-turn tool-schema reselection is a real cache limiter, but it is **a no-op until the active tool pool exceeds `DEFAULT_K = 48`** (`tool_retrieval.py:30`) and it *defers parameter schemas* rather than adding/removing tools (`runtime.py:869-930`). Its fix belongs to CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES. This plan must not "fix" it — but §C2 does move the catalog **behind** the stable span so its churn stops poisoning the prefix.
- Only vendors with explicit cache markers benefit from §C4 (Anthropic-family and Bedrock-Anthropic today). OpenAI-family benefits via §C2+§C3 only. Local/Ollama/vLLM benefit only if the app declares a prefix-caching capability.
- **Never log a saving a provider didn't report.** The readout is driven by provider-reported cache tokens, never an estimate — mirroring `model_pricing.json`'s existing "a model absent here costs 0.0 (honest: we never invent a price)" discipline.

## Design

- **S1 — make the prefix reachable and stable (no marker yet, and valuable on its own).** Two ordering repairs, both of which pay off *immediately* for automatic-caching vendors and are the precondition for the marker to hit at all. (a) §C2 splits `system`-role messages by stability at the translation edge: the stable assembled context leads the served prompt, and per-turn runtime notes move to the **end** of the message list, so nothing volatile precedes the stable span. (b) §C3 moves the volatile `[CURRENT DATE]` line out of prefix position 2 — truncation-immune per F2. After S1, an OpenAI-family provider can hit a cross-turn prefix with **zero** further work.
- **S2 — the neutral marker + provider adoption.** A new core module `llm/prompt_cache.py` owns the vendor-neutral hint and the one middleware function that decides which message carries it; `ProviderCapability` gains `prompt_cache: PromptCache = PromptCache.NONE`; the core Anthropic adapter translates the hint into `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`; the core OpenAI adapter declares `AUTOMATIC` and translates nothing. A rails test pins vendor cache syntax to the one adapter.
- **S3 — the proof.** Read the two cache fields off the Anthropic response into `LLMEvent` (**the missing producer, F3**), aggregate a hit-rate + saved-USD off provider-reported numbers only, and hand them to the surface COST-AND-TOKEN-OBSERVABILITY renders. **S3 is not optional polish — it is what makes S1/S2 falsifiable.** Ordering note: S3's producer is what V2 measures against, so if S2 and S3 land in one session, do T3.1 first.
- **What this is NOT:** not a response cache (identical-prompt→stored-answer changes semantics; explicitly out of scope); not a semantic/embedding cache; not context compaction (CONTEXT-ECONOMY owns it, this plan only reacts); not tool-schema stabilisation or failure retention (CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES owns both); not a new capability-negotiation protocol (it extends the one that exists).

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE](INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md))

### C1 — The neutral cache hint + middleware (`llm/prompt_cache.py`, new)

```python
class PromptCache(str, Enum):
    """Graded, opt-in prompt-cache support — copies the SHAPE of
    StructuredOutput (capabilities.py:63) deliberately: default NONE = the
    safe path for every provider until it declares otherwise."""
    NONE = "none"            # no caching; middleware is a byte-identical no-op
    AUTOMATIC = "automatic"  # vendor caches a stable prefix with no request marker (OpenAI-family)
    EXPLICIT = "explicit"    # vendor requires a per-request breakpoint marker (Anthropic-family)

# The neutral marker. Set by the middleware on AT MOST ONE message dict.
#   {"role": "user", "content": "...", "cache": True}
# Meaning: "a provider with EXPLICIT support should place a cache breakpoint at
# the END of this message." A provider that does not understand the key IGNORES
# it — every existing adapter passes unknown message keys over silently, so this
# is additive and safe by construction.
CACHE_HINT_KEY = "cache"

def mark_cacheable_prefix(
    messages: list[dict], *, support: PromptCache, generation: int = 0
) -> list[dict]:
    """Return ``messages`` with the stable-head message hinted as cacheable.

    Rules (all load-bearing — an executor must implement every clause):
      * ``support is PromptCache.NONE`` → return ``messages`` UNCHANGED (same
        list object, same dicts, no copies). The byte-identical guarantee.
      * ``support is PromptCache.AUTOMATIC`` → return ``messages`` unchanged
        too: the vendor needs no marker, and adding a key it ignores would make
        the dicts differ from today's for no benefit.
      * ``support is PromptCache.EXPLICIT`` → hint the LAST message of the
        STABLE HEAD (§C5 defines the head). Never hint more than one message:
        vendors cap breakpoints (Anthropic allows 4) and one at the head
        boundary captures the large, reusable span. Never hint a ``tool`` role.
      * The returned list is a NEW list; the hinted dict is a SHALLOW COPY with
        the hint added (never mutate a caller's dict — the native loop keeps
        ``self._messages`` as durable turn state and a mutation would persist a
        wire-format detail into conversation history).
      * ``generation`` is opaque here; it exists so a caller can force a miss
        (§C5) — the middleware does not interpret it.
    """
```

Placement rule: this module imports NOTHING vendor-specific and contains no vendor string. `grep -i "cache_control\|ephemeral" src/gideon/llm/prompt_cache.py` must return zero — the neutral/edge split is the whole point.

### C2 — Wire order: stability-ordered `system` messages (`llm/anthropic.py`) — **the fix for F1**

The defect: `_translate_messages` concatenates **all** `system` messages into `system=` (`anthropic.py:129-132, 183`), which Anthropic serves **ahead of `messages[0]`**. Since the native loop's only `system` messages are per-turn volatile ones, today's served prompt begins with a string that changes every turn.

The contract: **`system` messages are split by stability, not merged blindly.**

```
TODAY (served order, verified by reproduction):
  system=  ← the per-turn turn_note (note+catalog+stubs)   ★ VOLATILE, FIRST
  messages[0] = assembled context (stable)
  messages[1..] = conversation

AFTER:
  system=  ← the STABLE assembled context only            ★ stable, first
  messages[0..] = conversation
  messages[-1] = the per-turn turn_note (note+catalog+stubs)       ★ volatile, LAST
```

Rules an executor must honor:
- The native loop **tags** its messages so the edge can tell stable from volatile; the adapter must not sniff content. Add a neutral, documented key set by the loop (e.g. `{"role": "system", "content": ..., "volatile": True}` on the turn-note message at `runtime.py:712` — the one and only volatile `system` message). Untagged `system` messages keep **today's** behavior (hoisted into `system=`) — a provider or caller that knows nothing of this key is unaffected.
- A volatile note is delivered as a **`system`-role message at the end of the message list** if the vendor permits mid-list system content, and otherwise as the closing `user`-role turn. Whichever shape is chosen, **the note's text is unchanged and it is still delivered every turn** — this is a position change, never a content change. Guardrail (3) applies: if a vendor cannot carry it late without altering meaning, leave that vendor's order alone and record it.
- **The content the model receives must be equivalent, and a test must prove it**: assert that the concatenation of all delivered text (system + messages) contains every note that shipped before, exactly once.
- This is an ordering change with a **behavioral surface** (the model sees the turn-note late rather than early). Recency generally *helps* an instruction take effect, but V1 must confirm no regression in tool-catalog comprehension — specifically, that a model still calls `tool_schema` for a deferred tool after the catalog moved late. If it regresses, that is a DISCOVERY and a stop, not something to paper over.

### C3 — Prefix stability: the volatile date line (`context.py`) — **with F2's truncation fix**

```
TODAY   (context.py:764-773, verified):
  [critical-rules snippet]
  [CURRENT DATE] Tuesday, 2026-07-29 14:23 JST      ← changes EVERY MINUTE
  [agent identity / runtime]
  [workspace identity] [skills] [memory] [lessons] [hooks] [thread history]

AFTER:
  [critical-rules snippet]
  [agent identity / runtime]
  [workspace identity] [skills] [memory] [lessons] [hooks] [thread history]
  [CURRENT DATE] Tuesday, 2026-07-29 14:23 JST      ← appended AFTER truncation
```

The date line's **text is byte-identical**; only its position moves. Keep this rationale in the code comment: everything ahead of the volatile line becomes a stable prefix reusable across sessions for the same agent, and recency also helps the model treat "today" as current.

Three clauses an executor must honor — the third is the F2 bug fix and is **not optional**:
- `build_session_context` has an `is_custom` branch that skips skills/workspace identity (`context.py:751-758`). The date line must be last in **both** branches.
- Any test asserting the date's position must be updated in the same commit — `tests/test_context.py:698-707` and the freeze fixture at `tests/test_context_engine.py:45` are the known sites; grep `CURRENT DATE` for others.
- **The date line must be appended AFTER the `_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` truncation step** (`context.py:992-1002`), not before. Truncation cuts from the end (`context[:_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS]`), so a tail-positioned date is the first thing a large context loses. Structure it as: assemble → truncate → append the date line. A test must assert the date survives when the assembled body exceeds `_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` (build an oversized context and assert `[CURRENT DATE]` is still present and last). Without this clause the change silently regresses "what day is it" for exactly the heaviest users.

### C4 — Capability declaration + vendor translation (edge-only)

```python
# llm/capabilities.py — additive field on the EXISTING dataclass (capabilities.py:47)
prompt_cache: PromptCache = PromptCache.NONE   # default-off, same shape as structured_output

# llm/anthropic.py::complete — the ONLY core site that may say "cache_control".
# After `system_prompt, anth_messages = _translate_messages(messages)` (anthropic.py:417):
#   for a hinted message, append cache_control to its LAST content block:
#     block["cache_control"] = {"type": "ephemeral"}
#   After §C2 the stable span IS the `system=` param, so the marker normally
#   attaches to the last system block — which requires `system=` to be
#   BLOCK-SHAPED (a list of {"type":"text",...}) rather than a bare string.
#   The translation owns this asymmetry; core never learns it.

# llm/openai.py — declares PromptCache.AUTOMATIC and translates NOTHING.
```

Provider-boundary note: vendor cache syntax in a *core* adapter is permitted **only** because `llm/anthropic.py` and `llm/openai.py` are already the two in-core protocol clients enumerated in `docs/architecture/provider-boundary.md`. No new exception is created, and **no vendor cache syntax may appear anywhere else in core** — a rails test asserts it (T2.4).

### C5 — What counts as the "stable head", and when the cache generation bumps

After §C2, the stable head is **the assembled-context content that reaches `system=`** plus, for vendors without a system param, `messages[0]`. Everything after it — every conversation turn, the per-turn runtime notes now at the tail, and the tool block — is **outside** the head and is never hinted.

Explicit non-goals inside this contract, so nobody widens it:
- The **tools kwarg is never marked.** It is reselected per turn (`runtime.py:851-930`) and stabilising it belongs to CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES.
- The volatile runtime notes are never marked (they are per-turn metadata by construction — `runtime.py:711` says so).

Generation bump (forces a deliberate miss rather than a silent one) on:
1. **Compaction** — `_maybe_compact()` replacing `self._messages` (`runtime.py:1292`) invalidates everything; the loop increments its generation counter at that point.
2. **Agent-definition change** mid-session (model or prompt swap), which rewrites the prefix content anyway.

A bump is a normal, expected event; log at DEBUG only (never a warning — this is not an error condition).

### C6 — Config (§2.1 five-point wiring — all five points required)

```python
# config/loader.py, inside the models/llm section (follow the nearest existing sibling):
prompt_cache_enabled: bool = field(
    default=True,
    metadata=_meta("Prompt caching", "Ask providers that support it to cache the stable "
                   "prompt prefix. Reduces cost and latency on multi-turn work. No effect "
                   "on providers without cache support."),
)
```

Wire through: (1) dataclass + `_meta`; (2) `load()`'s explicit mapping; (3) `to_dict()`; (4) the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist (`dashboard/handlers/core.py:436` — the `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` dict, `{"type": "bool"}`); (5) a frontend control in the Models settings panel. `tests/test_config_roundtrip.py` catches misses — complete the wiring, don't fight it.

**Scope of the switch (sharpened in rev 2):** it gates the **marker** (§C1/§C4) only. It does **not** revert the §C2/§C3 ordering repairs: those are unconditional improvements that must not fork into two maintained orderings (clean-break doctrine — no dual paths). An executor must not add a second code path to "restore" the old order when caching is off.

**Default-ON justification** (an executor will ask): caching is semantically transparent — the model sees the same tokens either way — and every provider path degrades to a byte-identical no-op. It is a cost optimisation with no behavioral surface, so opt-out is the honest default. The switch exists for diagnosis (ruling caching out when debugging a provider), not because caching is risky.

### Integration points

- **Calls:** `ProviderCapability` (`llm/capabilities.py:47`), `pricing.estimate_cost` (`pricing.py:63`, unchanged — already accepts both cache args), `AppConfig.load()`.
- **Called by:** `agents/native/runtime.py` (ONE new middleware call immediately before `complete()` at `:747`, plus the volatile tagging in §C2); the two core adapters read the capability.
- **Storage owned:** none in S1/S2 (class A). The cache-hit aggregate persists through whatever store COST-AND-TOKEN-OBSERVABILITY defines — **this plan must not invent a second stats file**; `stats.py:42-84` already has the counters.
- **Deliberately NOT touched:** compaction internals (CONTEXT-ECONOMY), tool retrieval/`_prepare_turn_tools` (CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES), ACP runtimes (an external CLI owns its own request shape — out of scope by construction), `stream()`'s stateful history path (only the stateless `complete()` path is in scope; `stream()` is the legacy simple-prompt adapter).

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under [EXECUTION-PROTOCOL](EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md))

### Session 1 — Wire-order repair + prefix stability (no marker; pays off on its own)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | §C2 wire order: tag the loop's per-turn `system` message volatile (`runtime.py:712` — a single message carrying note+catalog+stubs); `_translate_messages` keeps untagged `system` in `system=` and delivers volatile notes at the END of the message list. Test asserts (a) the stable assembled context leads the served prompt, (b) every note that shipped before still ships exactly once, (c) an untagged-only message list produces **today's exact** request kwargs | `src/gideon/llm/anthropic.py`, `src/gideon/agents/native/runtime.py`, tests | served order is stable-then-volatile; content-equivalence test green; no-tag path byte-identical |
| T1.2 | §C3 date relocation **incl. the truncation fix**: move `[CURRENT DATE]` to the end of the assembled block in BOTH branches, appended AFTER the `_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` truncation; update `tests/test_context.py:698-707` and the `test_context_engine.py:45` fixture; comment states both reasons (cache stability + recency) | `src/gideon/context.py`, affected tests | date text unchanged and present in both branches; **an oversized context still ends with the date line** (explicit test); assembling twice ~1 min apart is byte-identical up to the final date line |
| V1 | Validation as a user: on an isolated dev home with a real Anthropic-family model, run a 4-turn conversation including one turn that triggers the deferred-tool catalog; confirm from the gateway log that the served prefix is stable across turns, and confirm the model still calls `tool_schema` for a catalog tool (the §C2 recency check). `make lint` + targeted pytest + `make test` + web typecheck/test/build | — | holds; no tool-comprehension regression |

### Session 2 — The neutral marker + provider adoption

|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | `llm/prompt_cache.py`: `PromptCache`, `CACHE_HINT_KEY`, `mark_cacheable_prefix` (every C1 clause incl. shallow-copy-never-mutate); unit tests incl. **the byte-identical assertion** for `NONE`/`AUTOMATIC` (assert the returned list `is` the input and no dict gained a key) | `src/gideon/llm/prompt_cache.py`, `tests/test_prompt_cache.py` | `NONE`/`AUTOMATIC` return the input object unchanged; `EXPLICIT` hints exactly one non-`tool` message; caller dicts never mutated; vendor-string grep returns zero |
| T2.2 | `ProviderCapability.prompt_cache` (default `NONE`, docstring mirroring `structured_output`'s rationale); core OpenAI adapter declares `AUTOMATIC`; middleware wired into the native loop before `complete()` with a loop-owned `_cache_generation` bumped on compaction (`runtime.py:1292`) and agent-definition change, DEBUG-logged | `llm/capabilities.py`, `llm/openai.py`, `agents/native/runtime.py`, tests | default-off preserved for every undeclared provider; a `NONE` provider's message list is byte-identical to today; a compaction bumps the generation |
| T2.3 | Anthropic translation: hinted span → `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` on its last block, incl. the **block-shaped `system=`** required by §C4; declares `EXPLICIT`; test asserts the wire shape and that an unhinted list produces today's exact request kwargs | `llm/anthropic.py`, tests | marker lands on exactly one block; unhinted requests byte-identical; block-shaped-system case covered |
| T2.4 | Config `prompt_cache_enabled` through all five §C6 points incl. the frontend control; middleware treats disabled as `NONE`; **assert the ordering repairs are NOT gated** by it | `config/loader.py`, `dashboard/handlers/core.py`, `web/src/pages/settings/`, tests | `test_config_roundtrip.py` green; PATCH round-trips; toggling off yields the byte-identical marker path with ordering intact |
| T2.5 | Rails test: `cache_control` / `"ephemeral"` appear ONLY in `llm/anthropic.py` — a sweep over `src/` fails on any other occurrence, mirroring the existing provider-boundary residue sweep. Prove it fails by temporarily introducing a violation | `tests/` (beside the existing rails sweep) | sweep fails on an injected violation |

### Session 3 — The measurement surface (**the producer — F3; do T3.1 first if merged with S2**)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | **The missing producer.** Read `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` / `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` off the Anthropic response in BOTH accumulation sites (`anthropic.py:302-309` and `:457-464`) and pass them into the terminal `LLMEvent` (the terminal event constructed at `:386` and `:533`). Defensive `getattr` like the existing token reads, so an SDK without the fields yields 0 | `llm/anthropic.py`, tests | a mocked response carrying cache usage produces a non-zero `cache_read_tokens` on the event; a response without the fields yields 0 and does not raise |
| T3.2 | Aggregate per turn and expose `cache_read_tokens`/`cache_creation_tokens`/`cache_hit_pct` + saved-USD (via existing `estimate_cost` rates) on the turn-complete telemetry COST-AND-TOKEN-OBSERVABILITY consumes, reusing `stats.py`'s counters — **do NOT create a second store**; never estimate when the provider reported nothing | `agents/native/runtime.py`, `stats.py`, tests | a real multi-turn run reports a rising hit-rate and non-zero saved-USD; an unpriced model reports tokens with 0.0 saved (honest-zero test) |
| V2 | Validation as a user: with a real Anthropic-family model AND a real OpenAI-family model bound, run the same 5-turn conversation on each; record hit-rate + saved-USD for both; confirm turn 1 reports `cache_creation_tokens` and turns 2+ report non-zero `cache_read_tokens`; confirm the OpenAI path reports vendor-side cache reads with **no marker sent**; confirm a local/Ollama model (undeclared ⇒ `NONE`) runs byte-identically with zeros; toggle the config off and confirm the marker stops while the ordering holds; full local gate | — | holds. **A near-zero hit rate is a DISCOVERY (log it), not a silent pass** |

## Owner tasks (real world)
1. **Coordinated apps-repo change (S2 follow-up, owner-sequenced):** declare the real posture on the branded model apps — `bedrock-models` (`EXPLICIT` for Anthropic-family on Converse, which uses `cachePoint` blocks rather than `cache_control` — the app owns that translation, core never learns it), `openai-compatible`/`openrouter-models` (`AUTOMATIC` where the upstream caches), `ollama-models`/`vllm-models` (`EXPLICIT` only if prefix caching is actually enabled server-side; otherwise leave `NONE` — an undeclared provider must never be assumed).
2. **Confirm the §C2 volatile-note relocation is acceptable behaviorally.** It is the one change in this plan that alters what position the model sees an instruction in. V1 checks tool-catalog comprehension; the owner should sanity-check a real session before S2 builds on it.
3. **Decide whether to widen the marker beyond one breakpoint** after seeing real hit-rates. Anthropic permits 4; a second breakpoint after the tool block only pays once CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES stabilises tool schemas. Deliberately deferred, not forgotten.
4. **Confirm the default-ON call** (§C6). The plan argues for it on transparency grounds; reversible with one field default.

## Risks & open questions
- **Silent no-win — the risk that already materialised once.** Rev 1 would have shipped a marker that could never hit (F1) with every test green. Mitigation is now structural: S1 fixes the wire order *before* any marker exists, and V2 requires *provider-reported* cache reads before a session may be marked complete. An unmeasured claim is not a done task. If hit-rates are near-zero after S1–S3, that is a DISCOVERY pointing at CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES' tool churn, not licence to widen this plan.
- **§C2 has a real behavioral surface.** Moving per-turn notes late changes where the model sees them. Recency usually helps, but "usually" is not "verified" — hence the explicit V1 comprehension check and owner task 2.
- **Cache-write cost exceeding the read saving on short sessions.** Writes are priced above base input (`cache_write 3.75` vs `in 3.0` for sonnet-4.6). A one-turn session pays ~25% more on the cached span. Accepted: the marker rides only the large stable head, and multi-turn agentic work (the dominant shape here, per the ~100:1 ratio) amortises it within two turns. The saved-USD readout must show this honestly, **including when it is negative** — do not hide a negative.
- **Provider drift.** Vendor cache syntax and TTLs change (Anthropic's `ephemeral` TTL is 5 minutes by default; Bedrock uses a different block shape entirely). Containment is the point of §C4: exactly one file per vendor to update.
- **Open:** whether `stream()`'s stateful path should also mark (deferred — it is the legacy simple-prompt adapter; the native loop uses `complete()`).
- **Open:** ACP-backed runtimes cannot participate (the external CLI owns its request shape). Recorded as a known parity gap rather than papered over; ACP-AGENT-PARITY may revisit.

## Execution log

**2026-07-30 — REDESIGN (rev 2), docs-only. No code changed.**

Owner ruling 2026-07-29: "Redesign the plan now and implement when it should be implemented in natural order of roadmap items wherever it fits." A pre-implementation audit of the wire path (not just the call sites) falsified rev 1's central mechanism and found a bug rev 1 would have introduced. Four findings, all reproduced from code and recorded in the new "Why this plan was redesigned" section:

- **F1 (fatal to rev 1):** `_translate_messages` (`anthropic.py:129-132, 183`) hoists ALL `system` messages into the top-level `system=` param, which Anthropic serves ahead of `messages[0]`. The native loop's only `system` messages are the single per-turn `turn_note` (`runtime.py:712`), which carries the tool catalog inside it (`runtime.py:930`). Reproduced: a volatile string leads the served prompt. Rev 1's breakpoint at the end of `messages[0]` would therefore have had a **structurally zero hit rate with every test passing**. New §C2 fixes the wire order and is now S1's first task.
- **F2 (a bug rev 1 would have shipped):** rev 1 moved `[CURRENT DATE]` to the tail, but `build_session_context` truncates from the tail (`context.py:992-1002`, `_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS = 165_000`). Heavy-context users would have silently lost the date line — a correctness regression traded for a cache hit. §C3 keeps the relocation but appends the date **after** truncation, with a required oversized-context test.
- **F3 (false premise):** rev 1 claimed cache accounting was "ALREADY plumbed end-to-end." The consumers exist (`stats.py`, `pricing.py`, `chat_runner.py`, `guardrails/model_call.py`, `acp/adapter.py`); **no producer does** — neither adapter reads a cache field off a response, so `cache_read_tokens` is always 0 and the plan was unfalsifiable. Reading those two fields is new work, now T3.1.
- **F4 (false premise):** `structured_output` is a valid precedent for the *shape* of a graded default-off capability, but its apps-side half shipped as a documented DEVIATION (a deliberate cross-repo seam), not for free. Noted explicitly, with a standing warning **not** to delete `structured_output` as dead code — it is not.

Restructured S1/S2 into three sessions so the ordering repairs (valuable alone, and the precondition for the marker) land before the marker, and the producer lands before the proof. Sharpened §C6 to state that the config switch gates the marker only and must not fork the ordering into a dual path. No task was dropped; T1.1 and T3.1 are new, and every rev-1 task survives with its clauses intact.

Status stays DESIGNED — implementation deferred to its natural roadmap position per the owner ruling.

- **PCS-2 DONE — [CURRENT DATE] moved after truncation (§C3).** `context.py::build_session_context`
  no longer appends the date line into `parts` (which is joined then hard-truncated at
  `_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS`, cutting from the END — so a mid-block date was the first thing an oversized
  context silently lost, regressing "what day is it" for the heaviest users). The line is now
  rendered once at assembly time (timestamp captured there) and appended to `context` AFTER the
  truncation step, for the single assembly tail both the custom and gideon paths take. Date
  text byte-identical; date now always the final block, exactly once. **Scope:** PCS-2 only (the
  ordering repair) — independent of PCS-1's volatile-tagging (different file: `context.py` vs
  `llm/anthropic.py`+`runtime.py`), so taken now without waiting on PCS-1; the cache MARKER + its
  measure-before-claiming gate remain PCS-1/T2.2/S3. No user surface → no CHANGELOG. **Gates:**
  `make lint` clean (697 files); 2 new `test_context.py` cases (date survives a shrunken-cap
  truncation as the tail block; present exactly once on a small context) + full `test_context.py`
  (52) + `test_context_engine.py`/`test_thread_context.py`/`test_project_context.py` (51) pass.
