# HARNESS-CRAFT

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/HC.md`](../atomic/HC.md) as 5 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Harness Craft — Fast Worktrees + Best-of-N + Check-Work

**Status:** PROPOSED (created 2026-07-17 from grok-build analysis — xai-org/grok-build, Apache-2.0, opened 2026-07-14)
**Created:** 2026-07-17
**Wave:** 2/3 — Session 1 (fast worktrees) is independent and can land any time a measured bottleneck justifies it; Sessions 2-3 (best-of-N, check-work) deliberately WAIT for WORKFLOWS-V2 Slices 0-3 so the sampling/verification primitives are built as engine templates + skills together, not as pre-engine one-offs that v2 would then absorb.
**Depends on:** nothing for Session 1. Sessions 2-3: WORKFLOWS-V2 Slices 0-3 (judge-panel/fan-out template machinery) — soft dependency; the SKILL.md halves work standalone, but the engine templates are where the value compounds. SELF-VERIFICATION Sessions 1-2 (spec harness) shares the judge substrate.
**Feeds:** LEARNING-FLYWHEEL (best-of-N outcomes are quality signals for the self-model); EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE (N-sample judge data seeds bake-off baselines); WORKFLOWS-V2-LOOPS-EVOLUTION (SDLC verify stage consumes the check-work skill).

---

## Source Analysis (2026-07-17)

xai-org/grok-build ships three mechanisms this plan ports, adapted to Gideon's substrate:

- **`xai-fast-worktree`** — a dedicated crate for cheap parallel git checkouts, used by their TUI's worktree commands and subagent fan-out. Confirms parallel-checkout speed matters enough at scale to earn dedicated engineering. → §1.
- **`best-of-n` bundled skill** — sample N candidate responses, judge, present/pick the winner. Shipped as a first-class built-in beside `code-review` and `check-work`. → §2.
- **`check-work` bundled skill** — a universal "review what you just did before declaring done" pass any surface can invoke — not tied to their coding loop. → §3.

Our positions: worktree fan-out EXISTS (`loop/worktree.py`, 287 lines — linked checkouts sharing the object store, per-project roots, merge-back, sequential fallback); gate judges EXIST in the SDLC engine (verify/test commands + conservative judge over deliverables, `loop/kinds/sdlc.py`); the LLMJudge helper EXISTS (used by loop gates and planned for EXTERNAL-ACCESS §9 replay). What's missing is (a) worktree setup cost tuning for large repos, (b) sampling-then-judging as a REUSABLE primitive rather than an engine-internal pattern, (c) post-task verification reachable from chat/workflows, not just SDLC stages.

## Overview

Three quality-of-craft mechanisms that make the harness measurably better at its core job — parallel execution speed, response quality under sampling, and self-verification before "done". Each is small, each is grounded in a shipped precedent (grok-build), and each lands on a seam Gideon already owns rather than adding a new subsystem.

**Soul guardrail:** no new provider types, no new stores beyond one JSONL, no new UI surfaces beyond skill outputs and one Settings toggle. Best-of-N multiplies LLM cost by N — it is opt-in per invocation, never a default, and rides the SpendMeter/ModelCallGuard chokepoint like every other multi-call pattern.

---

## 1. Fast Worktrees — Setup-Cost Tuning for Parallel Fan-Out (Session 1)

`loop/worktree.py` creates one full linked checkout per parallel task. Object store is already shared (git worktrees do this natively); the cost that remains is working-tree hydration — on a large repo, N parallel tasks pay N full checkouts, serially, inside the 30s `_TIMEOUT` budget.

### 1.1 Measure first
- Instrument `create_worktree` with a duration log line (repo size class: file count from `git ls-files | wc -l` cached per workspace). A fan-out of 4 on a 10K-file repo is the benchmark case. **If measurement shows <2s per worktree on the benchmark, Sessions 1's remaining items are SKIPPED and the plan is re-scoped** — this is explicitly a measured-bottleneck plan, honoring the "perf tuning without a measured bottleneck" objection that deferred it.

### 1.2 Sparse + shallow hydration (the grok-build lesson, git-native)
- **Sparse checkout for scoped tasks:** when a task's plan names its target paths (SDLC decomposition already produces per-task file scopes where available), create the worktree with `git sparse-checkout set <paths>` — the working tree hydrates only what the task touches. Fallback: full checkout when scope is absent/unreliable. Merge-back is unaffected (branches carry full commits regardless of working-tree sparseness).
- **Parallel creation:** worktree creation for a phase's READY tasks currently runs in the scheduler loop; batch the `git worktree add` calls through a small thread pool (bounded by `os.cpu_count()`, ceiling 4) — creation is I/O-bound and git handles concurrent `worktree add` safely (each takes the repo lock briefly).
- **Reuse pool:** on phase completion, instead of `worktree remove` + re-add for the next phase, RESET surviving worktrees to the new base (`git checkout -B <new-branch> <base>` + `git clean -fd`) — reuse beats recreate for repos where hydration dominates. Pool capped at the parallelism limit; teardown at loop end unchanged (including the restart-reap path).

### 1.3 Doctrine unchanged
- All calls stay best-effort + time-bounded; any failure degrades to today's sequential path. The reuse pool is transparent to the merge-back logic (same branch-per-task contract). No config surface beyond one `loop.worktree_sparse` bool (default true) through the standard four wiring points.

---

## 2. Best-of-N — Sampling as a First-Class Primitive (Session 2)

grok-build ships `best-of-n` as a bundled skill. Gideon's version is TWO halves sharing one core: a bundled SKILL.md (chat-invocable) and a v2 workflow template (engine-invocable) — built together so the judge logic exists once.

### 2.1 The core: `sampling.py` helper
- `best_of_n(prompt, n, judge_criteria, use_case="background") -> {winner, candidates, judgments}`: N parallel `one_shot_completion` calls (temperature-varied), then LLMJudge scores each against `judge_criteria`, returns the winner + full slate. Every call rides the ModelCallGuard chokepoint (metering, breaker, audit) — N× cost is visible in `model_calls.jsonl`, budgeted by the SpendMeter.
- Outcome record appended to `~/.gideon/sampling_outcomes.jsonl` (bounded): `{ts, n, criteria_digest, winner_idx, score_spread, tokens_total}` — the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL/EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE feed (did sampling actually help? is the spread ever meaningful for this use-case?).

### 2.2 The skill: `skills/bundled/best-of-n/SKILL.md`
- Triggers: "give me N options", "best of", "try a few versions", "sample and pick". Behavior: confirm N + criteria with the user (N capped at 5), run the core, present the winner with a collapsible slate of runners-up (the OPTIONS chip pattern for "use #2 instead"). The skill NAMES the cost multiplier in its confirmation ("this runs N model calls").
- The confirmation gate follows the `grill` skill's ambiguous-trigger precedent: explicit triggers activate immediately; ambiguous ones offer the choice.

### 2.3 The template: v2 judge-panel consumer (lands with/after WORKFLOWS-V2 Slice 3)
- A `best-of-n` workflow template: fan-out node (N samples) → judge node → select node. This is the engine-native form the roadmap already anticipated ("v2's judge-panel pattern will make this a template"); the template CALLS the §2.1 core rather than reimplementing, so skill and template stay behaviorally identical.

---

## 3. Check-Work — Universal Post-Task Verification (Session 3)

grok-build ships `check-work` as a built-in skill beside its coding loop. Ours must compose with what already exists rather than duplicate it: the SDLC verify stage (verify/test commands + deliverable judge) and SELF-VERIFICATION's planned QA Companion.

### 3.1 The skill: `skills/bundled/check-work/SKILL.md`
- Triggers: "check your work", "verify that", "did that actually work", post-hoc "are you sure". Behavior: reconstruct WHAT was claimed done this session (recent turns + tool calls), derive 2-4 CHECKS (file exists/content matches claim, command re-runs clean, endpoint answers, artifact renders), EXECUTE them with real tool calls (never self-report), report pass/fail per check with evidence quotes.
- Doctrine (from the loop-judge-independence work): ground truth over self-report — a check that cannot be executed is reported as "unverifiable", never assumed passing.

### 3.2 Composition, not duplication
- **SDLC verify stage** gains an OPTIONAL post-gate hook: when a stage's gate passes, `loop.check_work_stages` (default off) additionally runs the skill's check-derivation over the stage deliverable — catching the "gate command passed but the claim is broader than the command" class. One config bool; the skill logic is the same module.
- **QA Companion boundary (SELF-VERIFICATION S3):** check-work is the LIGHT, immediate, in-session half (seconds, current claims); the QA Companion is the DEEP, bundled-template half (spec-driven, whole-feature). The skill's doc names this boundary so the two never grow into each other; if SELF-VERIFICATION S3 lands first, check-work delegates its "deep verify" escalation to it.
- **Workflow template:** a `check-work` node template (same engine timing as §2.3) so any v2 workflow can end with a verification node — the engine form of the same module.

### 3.3 Chat surfacing
- After a turn where the agent claims completion of a multi-step task (heuristic: ≥3 tool calls + completion language), the existing suggestion-chip surface MAY offer "Check this work" as a chip (config `chat.offer_check_work`, default on) — invocation is always the user's click, never automatic (cost + latency stay user-consented).

---

## Provider-Fidelity Wiring

- **No new provider types.** The sampling core is a helper over `one_shot_completion`; skills are bundled SKILL.md dirs (existing loader); templates are v2 spec files (engine-owned).
- **Config:** `loop.worktree_sparse` (bool), `loop.check_work_stages` (bool), `chat.offer_check_work` (bool) — each through the four wiring points (dataclass `_meta`, `AppConfig.load`, `to_dict`, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` + FE).
- **Stores:** `sampling_outcomes.jsonl` (bounded, derived-data class — excluded from snapshots). No memory.db / knowledge.db writes; flywheel learns from the JSONL via the proposal path only.
- **SEL:** nothing here is security-eventful; normal logging only.

---

## Implementation Effort

**~3 sessions.**

- **Session 1 — fast worktrees (§1):** instrumentation + benchmark; sparse-checkout for scoped tasks; pooled parallel creation; reuse-reset between phases; config wiring; regression = existing worktree tests + a fan-out-of-4 timing assertion on the benchmark repo. **Gate: skip remaining items if measurement shows no bottleneck.**
- **Session 2 — best-of-N (§2):** `sampling.py` core + guard/meter wiring + outcomes JSONL; bundled skill with confirmation gate + slate presentation; as-a-user validation (chat: "give me 3 versions of this email, pick the best").
- **Session 3 — check-work (§3):** bundled skill (claim reconstruction → executable checks → evidence report); SDLC post-gate hook behind config; chat suggestion chip; QA-Companion boundary doc; as-a-user validation (agent builds something small, user says "check your work", checks execute for real).

Session 1 is fully independent (Wave 2, or whenever fan-out slowness is observed). Sessions 2-3's skill halves are standalone-shippable; their template halves land with WORKFLOWS-V2 Slice 3+ (Wave 2/3). If v2 slips, the skills ship alone and the templates follow — the §2.1/§3.1 cores are the stable seam either way.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Worktree "optimization" without a real bottleneck (the reason this was deferred) | §1.1 measure-first gate: <2s/worktree on the benchmark = skip and re-scope; instrumentation ships regardless (cheap, informative) |
| Sparse checkout breaks a task that touches unplanned files | Task scope is a HINT: sparse worktrees auto-widen on first out-of-scope write failure (`git sparse-checkout add`), fallback to full hydration; merge-back unaffected by construction |
| Reuse pool leaks state between phases | `checkout -B` + `clean -fd` reset; pool is torn down on any reset failure (degrade to today's remove+add); restart-reap path unchanged |
| Best-of-N burns N× tokens silently | Opt-in per invocation; confirmation names the multiplier; every call metered through ModelCallGuard; SpendMeter budgets apply; outcomes JSONL makes "was it worth it" answerable |
| check-work self-reports instead of executing | Doctrine inherited from loop-judge-independence: checks are tool calls or "unverifiable" — the skill text forbids assumed passes; validation includes an adversarial case (claim made, artifact deliberately broken, skill must catch it) |
| Skill/template drift (two behaviors for one name) | Both halves call the same §2.1/§3.1 core module; templates are thin spec wrappers; a shared test exercises both entry points |
| Pre-empting SELF-VERIFICATION's QA Companion | Explicit boundary in §3.2 (light/immediate vs deep/spec-driven); check-work escalates to the Companion when it exists rather than growing depth |

---

## Success Criteria

1. On the benchmark repo (≥10K files), a fan-out of 4 completes worktree setup in under half the pre-plan measured time — or the measurement gate documents that no work was needed.
2. A scoped SDLC task runs in a sparse worktree containing only its target paths; a task that writes outside its scope auto-widens without failing; merge-back produces identical results to full checkouts (diff-verified).
3. "Give me 3 versions and pick the best" in chat: confirmation names 3× cost, three candidates generate in parallel, the judge's winner renders with runners-up collapsible, choosing a runner-up works, and `model_calls.jsonl` shows all calls metered.
4. `sampling_outcomes.jsonl` accumulates records the Evaluation Substrate can read (score spread per criteria class) with no telemetry pipeline.
5. Agent completes a multi-step task with a deliberately planted flaw; "check your work" derives executable checks, actually runs them, and reports the flaw with evidence — zero self-reported passes.
6. With `loop.check_work_stages` on, an SDLC stage whose gate command passes but whose deliverable misses a claimed file is caught at the post-gate hook.
7. All three config fields round-trip through Settings (visible, editable, persisted) — the four-wiring-points lint passes.
8. With WORKFLOWS-V2 Slice 3 landed: the `best-of-n` and `check-work` templates run engine-side, behaviorally identical to their skill halves (shared-core test green).

## Execution log

- **[2026-08-15][S2] HC-3 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE, ATOM BLOCKED on an owner live-run.**
  `src/gideon/sampling.py` ships the core: N temperature-varied `one_shot_completion`
  calls fanned out concurrently (in-flight counter peaks at N *and* a fan-out span assertion,
  so a sequential loop cannot pass), an `LLMJudge` pass returning winner+candidates+judgments,
  and a bounded record appended to `~/.gideon/sampling_outcomes.jsonl` (declared as a
  `StateEntry`, snapshot-excluded). Fail-open in two tiers: one failed sample loses only that
  candidate; all-N-failed returns an explicit `winner=None` envelope rather than raising or
  fabricating an answer; a dead judge returns the slate `judged=False`. Determinism: highest
  score, ties to the lowest candidate index — proven across two runs whose N calls complete in
  opposite order. Mapped in `_CALL_SITE_SURFACES` as `assistant_reasoning`.
  `skills/bundled/best-of-n/SKILL.md` + a `best_of_n` MCP tool (schema, `TOOL_META`,
  regenerated reference) make it reachable from chat rather than an inert export.
  **MEASURED FINDING:** `one_shot_completion` had **no temperature parameter**, so
  "temperature-varied" was unbuildable as written. Added `temperature: float | None`, threaded
  through all three resolution paths and read into `extra_options` by the branded factory —
  the `embedding_model` precedent. Passing `extra_options=` as a build kwarg would have been
  *silently swallowed* by that factory (a live reader of an unwritten key), so the named-kwarg
  route is asserted behaviourally. Caveat documented: a model in extended-thinking mode drops a
  custom temperature, collapsing the ladder to a zero-spread slate.
  **BLOCKED, not done:** the third `done_when` clause — *"chat 'give me 3 versions and pick the
  best' validated end-to-end with all N calls visible in `model_calls.jsonl`"* — requires a
  running gateway bound to a real model. No agent can perform it (and doing so spends real
  money), so claiming `done` would assert a validation nobody ran. Every seam is unit-proven;
  what remains is one owner run on the dev instance. Status is `blocked` so a later tick does
  not re-implement the core.

- **[2026-08-16][S1] HC-1 DONE — instrumentation shipped; gate verdict `proceed`, with a named
  contention caveat at the floor.**
  **Premise correction (DEVIATION):** §1.1 says "instrument `create_worktree`". No such function
  exists. The real single creator is `loop.worktree.add_worktree`, and both production callers go
  through it (`loop/kinds/sdlc.py:1360` phase fan-out, `workflows/provisioning.py:487` for
  `mode: worktree` runs). Instrumented there rather than at either wrapper, so one line covers both
  paths.
  **The line (a contract, not a debug aid):**
  `worktree add outcome=created task=t-x ms=812 files=10432 size_class=large`, behind
  `TIMING_LOG_PREFIX`. `outcome` ∈ `created|reused|failed` because the three populations must never
  be averaged together — `reused` is `add_worktree`'s idempotent early return (near zero, and the
  datapoint §1.2's reuse pool would be judged against) and `failed` carries the duration that burned
  the 30 s `_TIMEOUT`. `files` AND `size_class` both: the count makes two runs comparable as a repo
  grows, the class makes a mixed log greppable without arithmetic. Decade buckets
  (tiny/small/medium/large/huge) so §1.1's 10K benchmark case lands ON the `large` floor instead of
  straddling a boundary; `unknown` is distinct from every real class so an unmeasurable repo never
  reads as a cheap one.
  **Cache:** `repo_file_count()` memoizes `git ls-files` per workspace abspath for the process, and
  `_log_creation` resolves the class only AFTER the clock stops. Both matter: instrumented the other
  way round, the first worktree of every process — the one a benchmark reads first — would report its
  own probe as hydration. A test injects a 600 ms `ls-files` and asserts the logged duration does not
  contain it.
  **Benchmark:** `harness/worktree_bench.py` + `python -m harness worktree-bench`. It parses the
  SHIPPED log line instead of keeping its own stopwatch — one measurement, not two that can drift,
  and the log contract gains a real reader. This repo has **3,047** tracked files and does NOT
  qualify as the ≥10K benchmark case, so the tool synthesizes a deterministic 10,000-file repo
  (100 files/dir, ~200 B each, content a function of the file index so two syntheses produce
  identical trees) under a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`. Nothing enters the committed tree. It
  refuses to run against the real `~/.gideon` (worktrees land under `config_dir()`, and its own
  cleanup would then delete inside the user's home).
  **RECORDED BASELINE — fan-out of 4, 10,000 files, sequential (today's path):** samples
  `[10442, 4501, 2947, 2975]` ms · mean **5216 ms/worktree** · median 3738 · max 10442 · spread 7495
  · sequential total **20.9 s** · outcomes `{created: 4}`.
  **CONTENTION CAVEAT (evidence, not a hedge):** every number in this session was taken while other
  agents ran full test suites and npm builds. Load average **21–35 on 18 cores** across the runs
  (captured with `uptime` before and after each). Two earlier trials of the same configuration:
  mean 13042 ms with samples `[23014, 11351, 4760]` **and one worktree FAILED at the 30 s
  `_TIMEOUT`**, and mean 6720 ms with `[13758, 6144, 3009, 3971]`. Run-to-run variation on identical
  input is therefore ~2x, and it is all in the upper tail. To separate hydration from the machine, a
  **40-file control arm was run in the same window**: mean **286 ms**, spread **18 ms**, total
  1142 ms. Subtracting that floor leaves ~2.7 s of genuine hydration in even the cheapest 10K
  sample, so the cost is size-driven, not ambient.
  **GATE VERDICT: `proceed` to `HC-2`** — unanimous: all four worktrees exceeded the 2000 ms gate,
  the cheapest by 947 ms. **The margin at the floor is thin and I am not going to dress it up:** a
  ~1.25x idle speedup would move that cheapest sample into the ±20% unresolved band. Consequence for
  `HC-2`: it is unblocked, but re-run `python -m harness worktree-bench --files 10000` on an idle
  machine and confirm before spending the atom. Independently of the threshold, trial 1's lost
  worktree is a second bottleneck signal that no contention discount removes — at this repo size a
  fan-out can drop a task's worktree entirely, not merely slow it.
  **DEVIATION (gate statistic).** The plan phrases the gate as "<2s per worktree", which reads as a
  mean. Implemented as UNANIMITY over the samples instead, and the measurement is what forced it: an
  intermediate version refused on a spread-exceeds-mean rule and would have reported `unresolved`
  for an arm whose every observation was more than twice the gate, while a mean-versus-threshold test
  would have decided the atom on which of four samples got descheduled. A right-skewed four-sample
  arm has no trustworthy central estimate; agreement is the only thing it can support. Under-size
  repos, narrower fan-outs, empty arms and straddling samples are all `unresolved` — a third outcome
  the `done_when` does not name, kept because "the measurement cannot answer" is a real result and
  rounding it to `skip` or `proceed` would be the failure this atom exists to avoid.
  **Falsifications (each run, mutation applied then reverted).**
  1. Duration hard-coded to `0` → 1 red:
     `AssertionError: logged 0ms ignores the injected sleep / assert 0 >= ((0.3 * 1000) * 0.9)`.
  2. Duration hard-coded to `999999` → the same test's OTHER bound reds:
     `AssertionError: logged 999999ms exceeds observed 718.5775419929996ms`. Both bounds are
     load-safe by construction — the floor is a sleep injected into the git call, the ceiling is a
     wall clock around that same call, so contention moves them together and neither is a fixed
     threshold.
  3. `size_class=` dropped from the line → **7 red** across both halves, incl.
     `test_creation_logs_one_parseable_row_with_the_repo_size`,
     `test_a_failed_creation_still_reports_its_duration`, and the harness's
     `test_parses_the_line_the_module_actually_emits` (the row regex is anchored on the full field
     set on purpose, so a lost tag is a parse failure, not a defaulted field).
  4. `repo_file_count` moved INSIDE the timed window → 1 red:
     `AssertionError: ['size-probe', 'git-worktree-add-returned', 'size-probe']`.
  5. `logger.info` → `logger.debug` → **7 red** (5 instrumentation + 2 harness). Worth recording
     because I predicted this one wrong: I expected the harness half to survive, since
     `collect_timing_rows` raises the logger level itself. It does not — raising the level to INFO
     does not resurrect a DEBUG call, so the collector is a level guard after all.
  6. **A mutation that reded NOTHING, called out as required:** `median_ms` replaced by a constant
     `0.0` → **46 passed, 0 red.** The median was printed by the CLI and by `to_dict` and asserted
     by nothing — a reported number nobody was defending. Closed in the same commit by asserting
     every field `to_dict` emits (`test_to_dict_carries_every_reported_number_and_the_verdict`);
     re-running the same mutation now reds. This is the one place these tests were weaker than they
     looked, and it was the report rather than the measurement.
  **One of my own tests was wall-clock-flaky and the contention caught it.** The first version of
  `test_the_size_probe_is_not_inside_the_measured_window` made `git ls-files` sleep 600 ms and
  asserted the logged duration stayed under that. It went red mid-gate —
  `logged 801ms contains the 600ms size probe` — because under load the real `git worktree add`
  itself took 801 ms. The assertion had quietly assumed the work was cheaper than the probe.
  Rewritten as `test_the_size_probe_runs_after_the_clock_stops`: an ORDERING assertion (the probe
  must be called only after `git worktree add` returns), which is the actual invariant, has no
  threshold, and cannot be flaked by load. Mutation 4 still reds against it.
  **A real-home rail red that was NOT mine.** One combined gate run reported
  `real-home rail FAILED: 2 entries under /Users/golani/.gideon changed` — `memory.db-shm`
  (32768 B) and `memory.db-wal` (0 B). Both are SQLite WAL sidecars that any reader creates, not
  state. Isolated it: the two new files alone, the pre-existing files alone, and the full combined
  selection all re-ran with `~/.gideon unchanged`, twice. Attributed to concurrent activity on
  this shared machine (other agents were running full suites in the same window) rather than to this
  change. Recorded rather than silently re-run, and NOT added to `ALLOWED_RESIDUE`.
  **Gate (all from `/private/tmp/hc1-wt`).** `make lint` clean — black 1686 files, isort, flake8,
  mypy "no issues found in 870 source files". `pytest tests/test_loop_worktree_timing.py
  tests/test_harness_worktree_bench.py` → **11 + 26 = 37 passed**. Existing `add_worktree`
  consumers green: `test_loop_worktree.py`, `test_workflows_provisioning.py`,
  `test_workflows_worktrees.py`, `test_loop_manager.py`. Ratchets/gates green:
  `test_inert_surface_baseline.py` (no new config key, enum member, trigger kind, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`
  entry or SDK export, so the census is untouched — baseline NOT regenerated),
  `test_portability.py`, `test_durability_inventory.py`, `test_resilience_degraded_lint.py`,
  `test_roadmap_dag_derived.py` (incl.
  `test_regenerating_the_committed_file_is_a_no_op` after
  `PYTHONPATH=…/src python3 tools/regen_dag_derived.py` — 640 atoms, 125 ready, 876 edges, 0
  dangling, no `regressed:` line), `harness`'s own `test_harness_validate.py` +
  `python -m harness validate` (15 specs valid, 0 warnings). `test_config_baseline.py` not
  applicable: no config field was added (§1.3's `loop.worktree_sparse` belongs to `HC-2`). CLI exit
  codes verified against the `fanout-measure` precedent: `2` for a measurement that could not happen
  (`not a git repo`), `0` for an honest `unresolved` verdict.
  **Full suite:** `pytest tests/ --no-cov -q -p no:randomly -n 4` →
  **20421 passed, 30 skipped, 12 xfailed, 0 failed** in 16m44s, `real-home rail:
  ~/.gideon unchanged by this run`.
  **CHANGELOG: no entry.** This is developer instrumentation plus a dev-harness benchmark — a log
  line at INFO and a `python -m harness` subcommand. No user-facing surface, no config field, no
  behavior change to any run: `add_worktree` returns exactly what it returned before.
