# LEARNING-VISIBILITY

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/LV.md`](../atomic/LV.md) as 7 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Learning Visibility — Make the Flywheel Felt

**Status:** DESIGNED — deepened 2026-07-18 with code recon (initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18; owner: "let's plan for this gap closure")
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Wave:** 1 (S1-2) + 2 (S3) + 3 (S4, with EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE)
**Depends on:** LEARNING-FLYWHEEL steps 1-4 (this plan complements the flywheel — it surfaces and pulls forward, never forks its lifecycle), INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION S4 (proposals as inbox items). EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE S1-2 for the S4 benchmark.
**Scope:** the market-visible half of learning: a pulled-forward end-to-end slice (run → proposed skill → approval → used-next-time-and-says-so), legibility surfaces, the refinement arm's UX, and a published benchmark. **Soul guardrail:** **propose-don't-write is inviolable** — every learned artifact passes the approval surface; no auto-write ships under any demo pressure (auto-written learning is OWASP ASI06 surface). If a slice can't be made visible without weakening a gate, the slice waits. Attribution shows *honest counts only* — no invented time-savings math before S4 measures it.

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18 — more exists than the outline assumed)

- **Synthesis machinery exists:** `after_turn_review.py` — `run_after_turn_review`, **`run_skill_ladder_review`** (skill-ladder synthesis prompt + JSON parse), `record_procedural_outcomes`, and capture-hygiene primitives already in place (`is_correction_signal`, `is_environment_failure_claim` — environment failures are never learned).
- **The refinement shape exists:** `skills/proposals.py::enqueue(kind="new"|…, refine_target=…, source_excerpt=fenced)` — proposals already model refinement targets and **fence source excerpts** ("a poisoned trace can't direct any model that later renders it"). Queue is capped (`_MAX_PENDING`).
- **Attribution substrate exists:** `skills/usage.py::SkillUsageStore` (`record_use/record_uses`, per-skill counts/recency, prune) and `surface_skills`/`search_skills` matching (`skills/surfacing.py`); `learn.py::LessonStore` for lessons.
- **Gap, precisely:** the ladder review's *wiring* (where it fires — verify chat-after-turn vs loop end-of-run coverage), the *surfaces* (nothing shows "learned" or "used" to the user), the *refinement trigger* (nothing detects a stumble and enqueues `kind="refine"`), and *proof* (no benchmark). This is wiring + UX + measurement, not new learning machinery — exactly the right shape.

## Design

- **S1 slice:** verify + extend `run_skill_ladder_review` firing: chat after-turn (existing — confirm) AND loop end-of-run (add at the loop-complete seam); hygiene preserved (gate predicates already imported there); proposals land in the existing queue → surface as inbox `proposal` items (plan 42) or the skills approval inbox pre-42 → on accept, the skill enters the store → next matching run loads it via `surface_skills` → `record_uses` fires → **the run says so** (S2 chips).
- **S2 legibility:** (a) per-run attribution — chat turn/loop run panel shows "used N skills you approved" chips (names on hover/tap) fed by the loaded-skills list the runner already passes to the ladder prompt (`loaded_skills` param — confirm plumb-through to the frontend event stream); (b) session "learned" chips — what after-turn captured/proposed this session (facets, lessons, proposals) with tap-through to approve/edit/reject; (c) weekly digest section — new/refined skills, promoted facts, pending proposals (rides plan 42's digest rule).
- **S3 refinement arm:** stumble detection at the after-turn seam when a skill was loaded: correction signal (`is_correction_signal`) OR failure-then-retry pattern OR explicit user rejection → capture the delta → `enqueue(kind="refine", refine_target=<skill>, …)` with a **unified-diff body** against the current SKILL.md → proposal surface renders the diff (approve = versioned overwrite via the accept path + provenance line in the skill frontmatter; version history = the store's file history + a `provenance:` frontmatter list). Coordinates with LEARNING-FLYWHEEL's refiner (statistical gates arrive with its Wave-3 steps and slot behind the same surface — same queue, same kind, stronger acceptance logic; no fork).
- **S4 benchmark:** EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE template study — fixed task set (owner-curated, ~10 repeatable research/ops tasks), paired runs skills-on vs skills-off (fresh fixture homes, same model+config), metrics: completion, tool-call count, wall time; publish methodology + results (site, plan 36) *including modest results honestly*.
- **User model:** deliberately deferred to LEARNING-FLYWHEEL's self-model step; this plan reserves a "Your model" digest card slot only (one owner, one mechanism).

## Contracts & Interfaces (builds ON existing synthesis machinery — [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) §3.6)

### C1 — Skill-draft synthesis (REUSES `after_turn_review.run_skill_ladder_review` + `skills/proposals.enqueue`, §3.6)
No new synthesis engine. The run-end hook builds an `enqueue()` call:
```python
enqueue(slug=…, description=<trigger-shaped>, triggers=…, procedure_md=…,
        session_key=…, created_at=…, kind="new", source_excerpt=<fenced>)
```
Then `emit_attention_item(source="skills", kind="proposal", refs={"skill_proposal": pid}, …)` (plan 42 C5) so it lands in the one attention store. Hygiene gates (`is_correction_signal`, `is_environment_failure_claim`) already imported there — reuse, never bypass. Budget: ≤1 synthesis call per run.

### C2 — Attribution (additive meta on existing turn/loop events — NO new event channel)
Runner already passes `loaded_skills` to the ladder prompt (verified `after_turn_review._build_ladder_prompt`). Plumb it to the frontend event meta: `{used_skills: ["slug", …]}`. `SkillUsageStore.record_uses(names)` (§3.6) fires on load. UI chip: "used N skills you approved" (names on hover). **Honest counts only** — no time-saved math until S4.

### C3 — Refine proposal (REUSES `enqueue(kind="refine", refine_target=<skill>)`, §3.6 — the field already exists)
Stumble detector at the after-turn seam (only when skills were loaded): correction/failure-retry/rejection → build a unified diff against the current SKILL.md → carry it in `procedure_md` with `kind="refine"`. On accept (existing `accept(pid, procedure_md=…)`), append `provenance:` frontmatter (date, run ref, pid). Cap: 1 refine/skill/day. The flywheel's statistical gates (its Wave-3 steps) slot behind this same surface unchanged.

### C4 — Benchmark (EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE template study)
`docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` defines: task-set schema, paired skills-on/off design (fresh fixture homes, fixed model+seed), metrics {completion, tool_calls, wall_ms}, honesty rule (publish regardless). Implemented as an eval-substrate study; results → site (plan 36).

### Integration points
- **Calls:** `run_skill_ladder_review`, `proposals.enqueue/accept/reject`, `SkillUsageStore.record_uses`, `surface_skills`, `emit_attention_item` (plan 42), the loop-complete seam (T1.2 locates).
- **Called by:** the after-turn path (chat) + loop end-of-run.
- **Consumed by:** plan 42 (proposals ARE inbox `kind=proposal`); its digest builder renders the "What I learned" block.
- **Coordination:** LEARNING-FLYWHEEL owns the self-model (user "About you" doc) — this plan reserves a digest card slot only, builds no parallel mechanism (one owner per §1.3).
- **Inviolable:** propose-don't-write — every artifact passes the approval surface; zero auto-write paths.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — The end-to-end visible slice

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | Map the ladder-review wiring: where `run_skill_ladder_review` fires today (grep callers; read `should_review` gating), what it enqueues, and whether loop end-of-run is covered — record the map in the Execution log BEFORE changing anything | — (read-only recon task) | Execution log carries the caller map + gaps |
| T1.2 | Extend firing to loop end-of-run at the loop-complete seam (locate via `loop/` completion path), same hygiene predicates, same queue; budget: at most one synthesis call per run (no per-cycle spam) | the loop completion site, `after_turn_review.py` if a shared helper is extracted | a completed multi-step fixture loop enqueues ≤1 proposal; environment-failure fixture enqueues 0 |
| T1.3 | Confirm/complete the accept→surface→use loop: accepted proposal's skill is surfaced by `surface_skills` on the next matching prompt and `record_uses` fires (add the missing wiring if any — verify where record_uses is called today) | `skills/{surfacing,usage}.py` call sites | integration test: propose→accept→matching-prompt→usage count increments |
| V1 | Validation: fixture home → run a repeatable 3-step task → proposal appears → approve → repeat task → skill loads and usage records; all under gates (no auto-write anywhere — verify by store inspection between steps) | — | full loop observed; ledger written |

### Session 2 — "What I learned" legibility

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Plumb per-run loaded-skills + usage into the frontend event stream (additive meta on existing turn/run events — locate the tool-result meta path; no new event channel) | runner event emission site, `web` chat/loop panels | run panel shows "used N skills" chip with names; zero new WS/SSE channels |
| T2.2 | Session learned-chips: after-turn captures (facets/lessons/proposals) render as chips with tap-through to the relevant approve/edit surface | after-turn result plumb-through, `web/src/pages/chat/` components | a correction in chat yields a visible chip within the session; tap lands on the right surface |
| T2.3 | Digest section: learning summary block (new/refined/pending counts + names) registered with plan 42's digest builder (coordinate; if 42 S5 not landed, render the same block on the skills page header and file DISCOVERY) | digest builder extension or skills page header | weekly digest (or fallback header) shows the block with real counts |
| V2 | Validation: a week-compressed fixture (seeded history) produces a truthful digest block; chips verified across chat + loop surfaces; reduced-motion/theme checks on new UI | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Refinement arm (Wave 2)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | Stumble detector at the after-turn seam (only when skills were loaded): correction signal OR failure-then-retry OR explicit rejection → delta capture; hygiene: environment failures excluded (existing predicate) | `after_turn_review.py` | unit tests per trigger; env-failure fixture never triggers |
| T3.2 | Refine proposal: build unified diff against current SKILL.md → `enqueue(kind="refine", refine_target=…, source_excerpt=…)`; cap: one refine proposal per skill per day | `after_turn_review.py`, `skills/proposals.py` (only if the diff body needs a field — prefer procedure_md carrying the diff + kind flag) | stumble fixture yields exactly one refine proposal with a valid diff |
| T3.3 | Diff rendering + versioned accept: proposal surface renders the diff (reuse the web Markdown/diff component if present — locate; else minimal diff view); accept applies via the existing accept path with `provenance:` frontmatter appended (date, run ref, proposal id) | proposal surface component, `skills/proposals.py::accept` | approve applies the diff; skill frontmatter carries provenance; reject leaves the skill untouched |
| V3 | Validation: seed a deliberately-flawed skill → run → stumble → refine proposal with sensible diff → approve → re-run succeeds with the refined skill | — | full arc observed |

### Session 4 — The public number (Wave 3)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4.1 | Benchmark protocol doc: task set schema, pairing design (fresh homes, fixed model/config/seed), metrics, exclusions, and the honesty rules (publish regardless of magnitude) | `docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` | protocol reviewable before any runs; owner sign-off (owner task 2) |
| T4.2 | Implement as an EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE template study (its S1-2 machinery); runner script producing a results table + raw logs | eval substrate study definition + `scripts/` runner | paired runs reproducible from one command against fixture homes |
| T4.3 | Publish: results page on the site (plan 36 sync path) + README one-liner if favorable, honest either way | site repo content | page live with methodology link |
| V4 | Validation: an independent re-run (owner or CI nightly variant) reproduces within stated variance | — | reproduction recorded |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **Curate the benchmark task set** (S4 — ~10 repeatable tasks that reflect YOUR real usage; 1-2 hours). The benchmark's credibility rests on tasks not being cherry-picked — the protocol doc asks you to freeze them before any measurement.
2. **Sign off the benchmark protocol + the publish decision** (including if results are modest — the honesty is the marketing).
3. During S1-S3 dogfooding, actually **review proposals in the approval surface** for a week — the queue cap and daily refine cap are tuned by your real tolerance; report friction.

## Risks & open questions

- **Risk — proposal spam:** caps exist (queue `_MAX_PENDING`, one-per-run, one-refine-per-skill-per-day); owner dogfood (task 3) tunes them; the flywheel's statistical gates strengthen acceptance later without UX change.
- **Risk — parallel-mechanism drift with LEARNING-FLYWHEEL:** structural guard — same queue, same kinds, same accept path; the flywheel plan's steps 5-9 upgrade internals behind the identical surface. A quarterly cross-check line item sits in that plan's coordination notes (add when its steps land).
- **Open:** whether refine diffs should be able to *split* a skill (one → two) — deferred; kind="new" from a refine context covers it manually.

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — sibling-platform gap analysis, owner greenlight)

**What & why.** The **periodic identity report**: a scheduled (default monthly, configurable) background job composing a readable "how I've adapted to you" narrative from EXISTING learned artifacts — never a modal, never a memory write. Recon confirms every input already has a read seam: `learn.py::LessonStore.load_all()/get_context()`, `preference_facets.py::load_facets()` + `decayed_stability`/`facet_state` (typed facets with class half-lives — the report can honestly say "stable for 4 months" vs "fading"), promoted skills under `skills/auto/` with `SkillUsageStore.all_usage()` (counts + recency) and curator aging states, `skills/proposals.list_pending()`, and `memory_service.memory_stats()` (:1101). This is a pure composition over S2's legibility data — it extends the "What I learned" surfaces (S2's session chips and weekly digest block) with the long-horizon view neither covers: the weekly digest shows deltas; the identity report shows the accumulated shape.

**Design (contract level).**
- New `learning_report.py`: `compose_identity_report(*, window_days: int) -> IdentityReport{period, sections: {facets: [{text, class, stability, state}], lessons: [...], skills: [{name, uses, last_used, aging_state}], proposals_pending: int, memory: memory_stats subset}, markdown: str}`. Deterministic gather + ONE `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` narrative pass over the gathered facts (facts fenced as data; the LLM narrates, it cannot invent counts — the numeric sections are attached verbatim). **Propose-don't-write:** the composer takes read-only snapshots; zero writes to memory/skills/facets; the honesty-ratchet lint (`test_resilience_degraded_lint.py::_CALL_SITE_SURFACES`) gains `learning_report.py → "assistant_reasoning"` (no-model floor: skip the narrative, deliver the deterministic sections).
- **Delivery:** persisted as an artifact (the existing `artifacts/` provider — versioned, linkable) + surfaced as an inbox item (pre-plan-42: a `source="learning"` InboxItem carrying the artifact link; post-42: `emit_attention_item(kind="report")`), routed through `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed` so quiet hours apply. Never a modal.
- **Scheduling:** a `created_by: system` clock job on the existing `ScheduleService` (`system:learning:identity-report`, monthly default) — migrating to the unified trigger store automatically when AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE lands (row-for-row, per its disposition table). Config: `learning.identity_report_enabled: bool = True`, `learning.identity_report_cadence: monthly|weekly|off` via the LearningConfig section (loader.py:990), 4-point wired.

**Lands in:** extends **Session 2** ("What I learned" legibility — this is its long-horizon sibling; T2.3's digest block already builds half the gather). Count stays **4 sessions**; S2 grows by ~half a session, recorded honestly.

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.4 | `compose_identity_report`: deterministic gather over LessonStore/facets/SkillUsageStore/curator-state/proposals/memory_stats + one fenced background narrative pass; degraded floor = sections without narrative; lint map entry added | `src/gideon/learning_report.py`, `tests/test_resilience_degraded_lint.py` map | fixture home with seeded lessons/facets/skills yields a truthful report; counts byte-match store contents; zero writes to any learning store (inspected before/after); no-model fixture still produces the sections |
| T2.5 | Delivery + schedule: monthly system clock job → artifact + inbox item (notify-gated); `learning.identity_report_*` config 4-point wired; FE: report renders from the inbox/artifact view (no modal) | `learning_report.py`, `gateway_services.py` (job registration), `config/loader.py`, inbox/artifact surfaces | job fires on a compressed-clock fixture; item lands in inbox linking the artifact; quiet-hours suppresses the ping but not the artifact; config round-trips; `off` disables cleanly |

## Execution log — LV-6 (S4 benchmark protocol doc)

- **LV-6 DONE.** `docs/roadmap/research/learning-benchmark-protocol.md` is frozen as **PROTOCOL v1**
  and owner-signed (owner task 2), with the ten-task register frozen (owner task 1) and its
  selection rule stated so it can be checked rather than trusted: **one task per bundled skill
  family whose procedure has a deterministic, non-judged observable**. The 14 skills under
  `src/gideon/skills/bundled/` were enumerated from a fresh home; four are excluded with
  reasons (`loop-worker` fires only inside a loop; `pclaw-api`/`pclaw-features` would test doc
  recall, not a procedure; `infographic-syntax` shares `visual-output`'s observable), leaving
  exactly ten. No task was chosen after seeing a result — no result exists. Task-set version is
  anchored mechanically on the library manifest's per-scenario `sha256`, which `RESULTS_COLUMNS`
  already carries as `scenario_sha256`, so a v2 row cannot be plotted as a v1 row.
- **The doc prescribes no tooling.** Metrics are specified against surfaces that exist:
  `evals/child.py::result_from_scenario` (completion + assertion-rate score),
  `ScenarioResult.elapsed_secs` (wall time), `TurnResult.tool_calls` (`eval/runner.py:448`),
  SEL `skill_surface` (`skills/loader.py:741`) for arm integrity, and
  `guardrails/audit.py::AttemptRecord` (`model_calls.jsonl`) for the token denominator. The verdict
  rule imports `harness/fanout_measure.py`'s three constants rather than restating them.
- **MEASURED — eight probes executed against `main` in throwaway homes** (never `~/.gideon`):
  (1) `SkillsConfig(max_triggered=0)` → `1` with a warning, `-5` → `1`; (2) a brand-new empty
  `GIDEON_HOME` + `SkillsLoader()` → **14 skills** present in `skills/`; (3) `install_library()`
  → 4 shipped scenarios, all `origin: shipped`, all `fixture_home: empty`; (4)
  `compute_pin("lesson_application")` → complete except `model_fingerprint`, `is_complete() == False`
  in an unbound home (so `append_result` would raise `PinRequiredError` — correct behaviour);
  (5) `harness fanout-measure` on arms named `skills_on`/`skills_off` → refused, exit 2;
  (6) the same observations renamed `fanout`/`single` → `fanout_wins` with delta 9.67, band 5.0,
  spread 4.00, token ratio 0.995; (7) `_expand_cells` with an `arm` axis at `trial_count=3` → 6 cells
  carrying distinct `arm` coords, and an AST census of `evals/child.py` → **exactly one** `coords.get`
  call, for `"model"`; (8) `result_from_scenario` over a scenario whose turn recorded three tool
  calls → no tool-call field in either the scenario summary or the cell result.
- **BLOCKING FINDING (doc §7 G1) — there is no way to run a skills-off arm today.** All three
  candidate levers fail, each verified: `skills.max_triggered` clamps below 1 to 1
  (`config/loader.py:1817-1819`); an empty fixture home is not skills-off because `SkillsLoader`
  force-syncs `skills/bundled/` into the home on construction (`skills/loader.py:293`, `:41`); and
  `feedback.suppressed_producers` is accuracy-derived and only reaches surfacing as
  `("skill_synthesis", key)` pairs (`skills/surfacing.py:304`), so it cannot suppress a bundled skill
  on request. No env override exists. Recorded in the doc as a named precondition on `LV-7`, not
  papered over with a procedure nobody can run.
- **DISCOVERY — the arm lever is already owned by EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE, and `LV-7`'s declared deps
  understate it.** ES §3.3 (atom `ES-7`) specifies replaying runs "with the skill surfaced vs
  suppressed (`arm_mask`)" — the exact lever this benchmark needs. `arm_mask` appears nowhere in
  `src/`, `harness/` or `tests/`: designed, unbuilt. `LV-7`'s row declares
  `EXT:EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE:S1-2` only, but §3 is a later ES session, so `LV-7` is gated on `ES-7`
  and not merely on S1-2. Left unedited here — the roadmap is owner-maintained and this atom's scope
  was the protocol doc; `LV-7` must consume `ES-7`'s `arm_mask` rather than grow a second toggle
  beside it (AGENTS.md §"Shared conventions", one owner per mechanism).
- **DISCOVERY — a declared axis that nothing reads is worse than a missing one** (doc §7 G2). Because
  `evals/child.py:162` reads only `coords["model"]`, an `arm` axis today produces N identical runs
  labelled two ways. Every artifact would look like a real comparison. This is the specific defect
  the protocol's arm-integrity rule exists to catch, and it is why the doc forbids the axis until the
  child honours it.
- **DISCOVERY — the metrics the plan's C4 declares are two-thirds unreachable from the matrix path**
  (doc §7 G3/G4). `tool_calls` is captured per turn and dropped by BOTH `ScenarioResult.summary()`
  and `evals/child.py::result_from_scenario`; `RESULTS_COLUMNS` has no column for it or for wall
  time. Worse and more fixable: the token denominator the honest verdict requires **already exists
  per-cell** — `AttemptRecord` carries `tokens_in`/`tokens_out`/`dollars_est`/`latency_ms` — but
  `model_calls.jsonl` and the SEL log are written into the cell's `GIDEON_HOME`, a
  `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` destroyed on exit, while only the cell *artifact* dir survives under
  the real home. `LV-7` must fold both into the cell payload before the child exits.
- **DISCOVERY — `run_matrix` has no production caller** (doc §7 G5): only
  `tests/test_evals_pinning.py` and `tests/test_evals_matrix_runner.py`. No CLI, no handler, no
  script. `gideon eval` does not reach it, and must not be used for benchmark runs because it
  isolates `GIDEON_WORKSPACE` but **not** `GIDEON_HOME` — so a CLI arm would surface the
  operator's real skills. Separately, `evals.enabled` and `evals.study_default_k` sit in the PATCH
  allowlist (`dashboard/handlers/core.py:643-644`) and are read by nothing under `gideon/evals/`;
  the doc tells `LV-7` to read `study_default_k` rather than hardcode `k`, and deliberately does not
  instruct an operator to flip a switch that changes nothing.
- **DISCOVERY — `gideon eval` ignores `fixture_home`.** `eval/scenario.py::_parse_scenario`
  reads `name`/`description`/`dimensions`/`seed`/`sessions`/`judge_criteria` and neither `version` nor
  `fixture_home`; those two are read only by the library manifest and `RunPin`. A scenario's declared
  fixture home is therefore honoured by the matrix path alone.
- **DISCOVERY — `harness/fanout_measure.py` is arm-name-bound by construction.** `load_observations`
  requires arms literally named `fanout`/`single` and errors otherwise (probe 5). The statistical
  posture and the three constants are reusable; `compare()`/`load_observations()` are not. The doc
  states the two honest options for `LV-7` (generalise the vocabulary in that module — an owner call,
  since the names are deliberately fixed — or a thin sibling importing the same constants) and rules
  out the dishonest one (relabelling `skills_on` as `fanout` to get a green run).
- **NOT DONE deliberately, and reported rather than built:** no paired arm was executed, because
  G1 means there is no skills-off arm to run and executing one arm twice under two labels is the
  precise artifact §1 of the protocol exists to prevent. No model was called; no cost incurred; no
  provider-reported token count observed. The doc says all of this in §9 so a reader is not left to
  infer that a run happened.
- **DISCOVERY (adjacent, not acted on) — `ES-1`'s atom row reads `todo` while its named machinery is
  on `main`:** `MatrixSpec`/`run_matrix`, per-cell artifact retention under `evals/matrices/`, the
  three-state `PASSED|FAILED|VERIFIER_ABSENT` aggregate, and the `EvalsConfig` PATCH entries all
  exist, and `ES-2` (which depends on `ES-1`) is already `✅`. The genuinely missing piece is the
  production caller (G5), not the machinery. Flagged for the owner; the header/row was left alone
  because this atom does not own the ES plan.

## Execution log — LV-1 (S1 end-to-end visible slice)

- **T1.1 CALLER MAP (recorded before any change, measured on `8b4ca7b0`).**
  `run_skill_ladder_review` (`after_turn_review.py:509`) had **exactly one production caller**:
  `dashboard/chat_runner.py:360`, inside `_maybe_skill_ladder_review`, gated on
  `learning_decision_for_turn(...)` plus its own `cfg.skill_ladder` flag and scheduled off
  `state._background_tasks`. **Loop end-of-run was NOT covered.** The seam is
  `loop/watchdog.py:401 _complete`, which already calls `_capture_loop_end` (`:464`, PP-5) — that
  mines lessons through `LearningGate(Cadence.RUN_END)` and never runs the ladder or enqueues a
  skill proposal. So every unattended loop — the runs that do the most work and re-derive the most
  reusable procedure — finished without proposing anything. Use counting: `context.py:1768`
  `SkillUsageStore().record_uses(skill_alloc.loaded)` in `build_message`'s `if skill_requests:`
  branch (a REFUSED skill is deliberately uncounted), plus `mcp_core.py:910`/`:961` `record_use`
  for skill tool reads. Install path: `skills/proposals.py:382 accept()` → `create_auto_skill` for
  `kind="new"`, sidecar overlay when a `refine_target` is still live.
- **T1.2 DONE.** `_complete` now calls `_schedule_loop_end_ladder(loop_id)` immediately after
  `_capture_loop_end` and **before** the `"complete"` publish — a sibling of the PP-5 hook, not a
  change to it. The sync scheduler owns the gate, the once-guard and the candidate-skill list and
  hands only the awaitable body to `state._background_tasks`, so the terminal status write and the
  publish never wait on a model call (falsified: converting the schedule to an `await` made the
  hanging-review fixture hit `Timeout (>30s)`). Gate order mirrors the chat path — `decision.allowed`
  and `cfg.skill_ladder` are answered before any run text is composed, and the strongest observable
  form of that ordering is asserted: `_loop_outcome_text` is never called when the gate denies.
  `loop.task` becomes `user_message`, the deliverable document (else `loop.summary`) becomes
  `assistant_text`, both capped at `_LADDER_TEXT_LIMIT = 6000` — matching `loop.finding_content`'s
  existing ceiling rather than inventing a number, because a monitor loop's `MONITOR_LOG.md` is
  unbounded and this text becomes a prompt. Env-failure hygiene needed no new predicate: passing the
  loop's real texts routes through `_ladder_pass`'s existing `is_environment_failure_claim` guard, and
  the env-failure fixture is asserted on the **queue** (a verdict marker reading `env_failure_claim`
  while a proposal sat in the queue would pass a verdict-only assertion).
  `_deliverable_file(loop)` was extracted from `_register_deliverable_artifact` so the workspace-first
  deliverable resolution exists once and both consumers get the same answer.
- **MEASURED — the once-per-run guard is load-bearing, not defensive.** `store.update_status`'s
  transition guard is `if current in TERMINAL_STATUSES and new_status != current`
  (`loop/store.py:445`), so `COMPLETE → COMPLETE` is **permitted** and `_complete` genuinely re-runs
  end to end. The guard is a per-instance `self._ladder_done: set[str]`, and a test pins the premise
  (`COMPLETE → COMPLETE` is reachable) so the guard cannot quietly become dead code; deleting the
  guard reds with `assert 2 == 1`.
- **T1.3 DONE — and the finding is that nothing was missing.** The accept→surface→use loop already
  closed on `main`: `accept()` → `create_auto_skill` writes `auto/<slug>/SKILL.md`;
  `ContextBuilder.build_message` → `skills.get_surfaced_skills(text)` (`loader.py:1004` →
  `surface_skills`) returns it on a matching prompt; `load_skill` per hit → `allocate_skills` inlines
  the body; `context.py:1768` counts the use. The test passed on its FIRST run with no production
  edit — that is the measurement. What was genuinely missing was a test *crossing* the four links:
  proposals, surfacing and usage each had their own suite, but nothing proved they compose. It drives
  `build_message` rather than `surface_skills`/`get_surfaced_skills` in isolation because
  `record_uses` is written **only** on that path — a surfacing-only test would pass with the counter
  entirely unwired. One long-lived `ContextBuilder` is built *before* the proposal and used for both
  turns (how the gateway holds it), which makes the pre-accept turn a real vacuity floor rather than a
  comparison between two loaders, and `progressive_disclosure_threshold` is pinned to 8: above the
  threshold the turn injects an index only and deliberately records no use, so a test drifting over it
  would have gone silently vacuous on the counter leg.
- **V1 OBSERVED — the full arc, in a throwaway fixture home, no model called.**
  `run ends → ladder fires → exactly one proposal (verdict `filed`) → approve → repeat the task →
  `[Skill: auto/release-flow]` in the assembled prompt with its procedure inlined → use recorded`,
  with the live stores inspected between every step. **Propose-don't-write held at each inspection:**
  after the ladder filed its proposal the `auto/` dir was still absent, the loader still did not know
  the skill, the same prompt still surfaced nothing and no use was recorded — only the accept installed
  anything, and exactly one `auto/` skill existed at the end. The second matching turn incremented the
  counter to 2, so it accumulates rather than latching at "seen once". The operator's real home was
  byte-listing-identical before and after.
- **Gate:** `make lint` green (black 2009 files, isort, flake8, mypy — no issues in 992 source files)
  and **181 passed** across `test_lv1_loop_end_ladder.py` (24), `test_lv1_accept_surface_use.py` (1),
  `test_loop_watchdog.py`, `test_after_turn_review.py`, `test_skill_ladder_review.py`,
  `test_skill_proposals.py`, `test_skill_usage.py`, `test_skill_surfacing.py`,
  `test_skill_allocation.py` and `test_skill_progressive_disclosure.py`, re-run on the combined tip
  rather than taken on report. Probe sweep: 16 `FALSIFICATION|if False and|# PROBE` hits, **identical
  count on the base commit** and none in the new files — the ~13 the brief expected was stale, so the
  count was confirmed against `8b4ca7b0` instead of assumed.
- **DISCOVERY (adjacent, not acted on) — the S2 chip has no channel yet.** `LV-2` will need the
  `used_skills` meta on the existing turn/run events; the ladder path already receives
  `loaded_skills`, but the runner does not forward the ALLOCATED set (`skill_alloc.loaded`, the same
  list `record_uses` consumes) to the frontend. That list is the honest input for "used N skills you
  approved" — the candidate list the ladder gets is every indexed skill, not the ones that reached
  the turn, and plumbing the wrong one would ship an inflated count.

---

## Execution log — LV-2 (S2 legibility: skills-used chip + tappable learned chips)

- **PROVENANCE — this work existed on one local branch with no remote ref and no PR.** Two commits
  (`952e823e` meta + origin discriminator, `a1068cad` the two chip surfaces) were written, gated and
  then never pushed; the duplicate-work guard found them. They rebased onto `03729754` with **no
  conflicts**. This entry is the log they never got, written by a later session that judged them
  rather than rebuilding them. **Not started over — the two commits' content is intact.**
- **T2.1 DONE, and it took the DISCOVERY at the end of the LV-1 log seriously.** That note warned
  that the ladder's `loaded_skills` is the CANDIDATE list (every indexed skill) and that plumbing it
  would ship an inflated count. The implementation instead narrows the assembler's existing
  `skill_decisions` (CE2-9, written at `context_engine.py:194`) to
  `_SKILL_USED_STATES = (ADMITTED, REDUCED)` — semantically identical to
  `SkillAllocation.loaded` (`skills/allocation.py:194`), which is the input `record_uses`
  consumes at `context.py:1768`. So the chip and the turn-time use counter cannot answer
  "used" two different ways. REFUSED is excluded by name, not just by state.
- **Zero new channels, verified two ways.** The payload rides `meta` on the finalized assistant
  message — the proven `memory_citations` seam — so nothing new is broadcast. Pinned by a static
  rail over every `broadcast_ws` name in `chat_runner` **with a vacuity floor** (the regex must
  still match every call site, or a new channel would read as none) plus a runtime half asserting a
  real turn broadcasts only known names.
- **DEVIATION (rebaseline, not a weakening) — the WS baseline drifted on rebase.** `queue_push`
  arrived from `57194f48` (PR2-10's ACP mid-turn steer echo) and reds the pinned set. It appears
  **zero** times in the LV-2 diff, and the rail's own vacuity floor held (49/49 call sites matched),
  so the name was added with that provenance recorded beside it. The red was upstream, not ours.
- **The three tap-through routes were verified against what each surface RENDERS, not its name.**
  `proposal` → `#/skills?mode=proposals` (`SkillsPage.tsx:43` selects `SkillProposals`, which
  accepts/rejects; the bare `#/skills` lands on Installed and shows no proposal at all).
  `lesson`/`facet` → `#/settings/memory?tab=studio`, which reads `api.lessons()`
  (`MemoryPanel.tsx:273`), deletes via `api.deleteLesson` (`:431`) and edits via "Save lesson"
  (`:843`) — so the lesson store's own artifact is showable and editable there. `?tab=lessons` is
  already an alias folding into `studio` (`:64`). Exactly three `learned` emitters exist in
  `chat_runner` and all three now carry `origin`.
- **GAP FOUND AND CLOSED — the LOOP half rested on two unpinned backend seams.** The chat chip reads
  meta off a message the page already holds, but the cockpit cannot: it resolves the worker key from
  `GET /api/loops/{id}` and reads the transcript over `GET /api/chat/sessions/{key}`. Both fail
  SILENTLY, because the chip's honest "absent when nothing loaded" rule renders a dropped
  `session_key` and a clobbered `meta` identically as *no chip* — nothing would have gone red. Two
  tests now pin them: `session_key` survives into `get_redacted` (the function `api_loop_get` calls),
  and `_prepare_messages` does not let its `cls`-derived `meta` overwrite `skills_used`.
- **A first draft of that first test was WRONG and falsification caught it.** It asserted on the
  `_redact_loop` helper and stayed GREEN when the endpoint's own view popped the key — it pinned a
  layer below where the regression happens. Rewritten to drive `get_redacted` against a real loop
  row under `tmp_path`, where the same mutation reds with `KeyError: 'session_key'`.
- **Falsification (four mutations, each grep-confirmed applied, each restored from a file copy).**
  (1) adding `REFUSED` to `_SKILL_USED_STATES` reds the admitted/reduced test; (2) deleting the
  `SkillsUsedChip` render in `ChatPage.tsx` reds the inertness rail — so that rail genuinely detects
  a correct-but-uncalled helper; (3) popping `session_key` in `get_redacted` reds the new loop test;
  (4) making the `cls` meta overwrite unconditional reds the new clobber test.
- **Accessibility, measured rather than read.** The tappable element is `TextLink`, and the a11y tree
  reports `role=link` with a non-empty, per-origin-DISTINCT accessible name for all three
  ("Review in Skill proposals →" / "Review lessons in Memory →" / "Manage in Memory →"), no
  `aria-hidden`, natively focusable. Both count chips are non-interactive (`<div title>` in chat,
  `MetaPill`'s `<span title>` in the cockpit), so `title` is a hover affordance only, not an
  accessible name — which is why the count is also in the visible label. That matches the sibling
  spend/elapsed pills exactly, so no new idiom was introduced.
- **Activity segments do not rehydrate.** `insertActivity` (`coalesceReducers.ts:54`) is the only
  production producer, driven solely by the live `activity_event`. So the learned chip is inherently
  session-scoped — which is what the criterion asks ("within the session") — and making the ledger
  link conditional on `origin` regresses nothing for reloaded history, because the chip never
  survived a reload. The degrade path is reachable only under FE/BE version skew.
- **SURFACED, NOT DECIDED (owner taste calls).** The learned chip's tap target sits inside
  `ContextLedger`, which is collapsed by default — collapsed you see "learned 1", and the link needs
  one disclosure. That is pre-existing ledger behavior, not something LV-2 introduced, so it was left
  alone rather than redesigned inside this atom.

- **DISCOVERY (2026-08-25) — LV-2 was re-briefed by an execution tick and found already built.**
  The atom still read `todo` in `dag.json` with no `blocked_reason`, so the readiness census returned
  it as startable and a subagent was dispatched at work that had shipped. It wrote nothing and left
  its branch byte-identical to `0faf4003`, which is the right outcome, but it is the second time this
  atom has consumed a slot. Root cause: the taste call above was recorded in prose here and nowhere
  a census can read. Fixed by giving LV-2 an explicit `blocked_reason` in `dag.json` naming the open
  question and what clears it. The verification it produced, for the record: chip renders at
  `LoopCockpitPage.tsx:585` (`MetaPill` forwards `title` onto a real `<span title>` at `:142-151`, so
  the hover is not inert) and `ChatPage.tsx:3803-3814`; both import the single formatter from
  `chat/chatTypes.ts:107/117`, so no second label formatter exists. Tap-through at `:3832` resolves
  `proposal` -> `#/skills?mode=proposals` and `lesson`/`facet` -> `#/settings/memory?tab=studio`.
  Two falsifications confirmed the existing guards are not vacuous: deleting the cockpit's
  `text={skillsUsedLabel(skillsUsed)}` render line reds 1 of 30 in `skillsUsedChip.test.ts`, and
  renaming a live `broadcast_ws("chat_status")` to a feature-shaped name fires BOTH halves of the
  zero-new-channel rail (static set + runtime). **A lesson worth generalizing: an owner taste call
  parked only in an execution log is invisible to the machine, so it reads as ready work forever.**
- **Gate:** `make lint` green (black 2031 files, isort, flake8, mypy — 1001 source files);
  **11 passed** in `test_lv2_skills_used_meta.py` (9 pre-existing + 2 added) and 69 passed across
  `test_after_turn_review.py` + `test_skill_allocation.py`; `scripts/gate_report.py` **all 6 gates
  PASS**; web **unscoped** `npm run test:web` **479 files / 5073 tests passed**, plus
  `npm run typecheck:web` and `npm run build` green from the repo root. Probe sweep 16 hits,
  **0** introduced by this diff.

- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **OWNER RULING — the link must be reachable WITHOUT the user opening the
  disclosure first.** The taste call parked above as SURFACED, NOT DECIDED (this file's lines
  358-361) asked whether "a visible learned-chip whose tap lands on the right approve/edit surface"
  requires the link reachable without first expanding the collapsed `ContextLedger`. **RULED: yes.**
  A learning the user has to go looking for is not visible, and visibility is this plan's entire
  subject — a chip that points at something behind a closed disclosure moves the work from "hidden"
  to "hinted", which is not what the criterion asks for. Recorded here because it was not yet in the
  tree at `fc1aac08`.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **DONE — one tap now opens the ledger AND lands focus on the approve/edit
  link.** `ContextLedger` + `LedgerRow` moved out of `ChatPage.tsx` into
  `web/src/pages/chat/ContextLedger.tsx` (exported, still rendered by the page) and gained a
  `useEffect` keyed on `[open, learnedHref]` that scrolls the row's `<a>` into view
  (`block: 'nearest'`, the app's 13-site idiom) and then `focus({ preventScroll: true })`. Scroll
  before focus, and `preventScroll` on the focus, so the two halves are independently removable and
  a test notices each. Keyed on the HREF, not the `surface` object: `learnedSurface` returns a fresh
  literal per render, which would re-steal focus on every unrelated re-render. A row whose origin has
  no known surface moves nothing — the ledger just opens, which is the pre-ruling behaviour and the
  correct degrade. Accessibility: the target is a real `<a href>`, natively focusable, and it RECEIVES
  focus, so the keyboard path lands there too instead of facing an unknown number of Tab stops; the
  collapsed chip's `title` gains "…opens and jumps to where you can review it" and its accessible
  name is unchanged (visible text, no `sr-only`). No backend change, no config field
  (`config/loader.py` **5900 lines before and after**), no new WS/SSE channel.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **DEVIATION — the extraction was the only way to assert the behaviour at the
  CALL SITE.** `ChatPage.tsx` is ~4k lines, owns a socket and a composer, and is not mountable in the
  vitest suite, so a contract like "the tap does both halves" cannot be proved while the component
  lives inside it — only "a handler exists" can, which is what this ruling rejects.
  `contextLedgerReach.test.tsx` (8 tests) mounts the real component with the real handler and taps it
  as a user does. The complementary rail that the PAGE still renders it (so the extraction is not a
  quiet deletion) lives in `skillsUsedChip.test.ts`, whose three ledger-side source scans were
  retargeted to the new module in the same commit.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **DISCOVERY — three of the atom's four citations had drifted**, measured
  2026-08-25 and re-measured today at `fc1aac08`. `LEARNING-VISIBILITY.md:358-361` is CORRECT.
  `ChatPage.tsx:3803` (chip) was really `3806-3838` — render at `:3737`, `SkillsUsedChip` defined at
  `:3820`. Tap-through `:3832` was really `:3850` (`learnedSurface(learnedOrigin)`), now
  `chat/ContextLedger.tsx:30`. `LoopCockpitPage.tsx:585` was CORRECT (`MetaPill` with
  `skillsUsedLabel`). Nothing contradicted the atom; all four addresses were recoverable by grep.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **DEVIATION — a GLOBAL design ratchet had to follow the moved file.**
  `web/src/ui/rawToggleState.test.ts`'s disclosure census pinned the ledger's button by
  `['ChatPage.tsx', 'open', 'aria-expanded={open}\n        className="flex items-center gap-1.5 rounded-pill']`.
  Path-scoped vitest runs stay green over this; only the unscoped `npm run test:web` catches it
  (1 failed / 5411 on the first full run). Retargeted to `chat/ContextLedger.tsx` with the anchor
  unchanged, so the census still counts 10 disclosures and still measures the same button.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **Falsification (four mutations on the LIVE file, each grep-confirmed applied,
  each restored from a copy at `/tmp/lv2c-ledger.bak`, never `git checkout`).** (1) disclosure half —
  `setOpen((v) => !v)` → `setOpen((v) => v)` reds **6 of 8**, HALF A first by name; (2) focus half —
  dropping `link.focus({ preventScroll: true })` reds **3 of 8** and leaves **HALF A green**, so the
  two halves are discriminated; (3) scroll half — dropping `link.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`
  reds the same 3, again with HALF A green, proving "brought into view" is not a side effect of the
  focus call; (4) vacuity — `useState(false)` → `useState(true)` reds the VACUITY FLOOR leg, which is
  what makes the positive assertions non-vacuous: without a genuinely CLOSED disclosure at first
  paint, "the tap revealed it" is satisfiable by a component that renders open. Mutation (1)
  necessarily reds HALF B too — with the disclosure wired shut there is no link in the DOM to focus —
  which is the honest floor rather than a blunt assertion.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **Gate:** `make lint` green (black 2138 files, isort, flake8, mypy 1054 source
  files); **42 passed** across `test_lv2_skills_used_meta.py` (the zero-new-channel rail, still green,
  untouched) + `test_structural_baseline.py`; `scripts/gate_report.py` **all 6 gates PASS**
  (`structural-size` included, headroom unmoved); web **unscoped** `npm run test:web`
  **506 files / 5412 tests passed** after the census retarget, plus `npm run typecheck:web` and
  `npm run build` green from the repo root. Probe sweep **0** hits introduced by this diff.
- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **ATOM COMPLETE — both `done_when` clauses met; `LV.md` row flipped to ✅.**
  Clause 1 (chip with names on hover, zero new WS/SSE channels) shipped in `22f53646`/`c09a0e7d`/
  `5d4250f2` and is re-verified green. Clause 2's last open question was this ruling and is now
  implemented and proved. **DISCOVERY for the driver: `dag.json` still carries `status: "todo"` and
  the now-stale `BLOCKED-OWNER (2026-08-25)` `blocked_reason` for `LV-2`** — that file is fenced to
  the driver, so it is untouched here and must be set to `done` with the reason cleared, or the
  readiness census will hand this atom out a fourth time.

## Execution log — `LV-3` (T2.3 digest learning block) — 2026-08-25

- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **DONE.** The learning summary block (new / refined / pending counts + names)
  renders on the skills page header at `web/src/pages/skills/SkillsPage.tsx:138`, fed by one gather —
  `learning_summary.compose_learning_summary(*, window_days=7, vs=None, now=None) -> LearningSummary`
  in `src/gideon/learning_summary.py` — served over `GET /api/learning/summary`
  (`dashboard/handlers/learning.py:513`, registered at `:567`). Component at
  `web/src/pages/skills/LearningSummaryBlock.tsx:53`. `skills/loader.py:501` grew an opt-in
  `list_skills(with_provenance=True)` mirroring the existing `with_usage` idiom, so `/api/skills`'
  payload shape is unchanged.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **DISCOVERY — plan 42's digest builder does not exist, so this landed on the
  sanctioned fallback.** T2.3 asked for the block "registered with plan 42's digest builder
  (coordinate; if 42 S5 not landed, render the same block on the skills page header and file
  DISCOVERY)". Measured:
  `git grep -n 'digest_section\|DigestSection\|digest_sections\|register_digest\|digest_builder' -- src/`
  returns **zero hits** — there is no digest-section registry under any name. The only `digest`
  producer in `src/` is `action_providers/digest_provider.py`, a 143-line
  `NotificationDigestActionProvider` whose public surface is `execute`, `create_provider` and
  `reconcile_digest_cron`; it has no section/slot concept to register into. So
  INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION S5 has not landed and the fallback clause applies. **No parallel
  digest mechanism was built** (§1.3, one owner per mechanism): the gather has exactly one home, so
  when plan 42's builder arrives it consumes `compose_learning_summary` rather than reimplementing
  the block.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **DISCOVERY — this plan's line-113 recon cites a read seam that no longer
  exists.** It names `learn.py::LessonStore.load_all()`; **`LessonStore` was deleted by WF2LEA-3** and
  lessons now live in `memory.db lesson.*`, read through the memory service. The block reads them via
  `MemoryService.over_vector_store(vs).get_lessons()`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **A silent-zero bug caught before shipping, and now pinned.** The first draft used
  `service_for(vs)`. `MemoryService._vs` (`memory_service.py:239-241`) resolves
  `getattr(provider, "vector_store", None)`, so handing `service_for` a `VectorMemoryStore` yields
  `_vs = None` and `get_lessons()` returns `[]` — **every lesson would have read as absent forever,
  with no error and no exception**. Mutation M4 re-introduces it and reds two tests.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **Writer census — the counts are real, not readers of unwritten keys.** Pending
  proposals: written by `enqueue` at `after_turn_review.py:641` and `history.py:1787`. Facets:
  `upsert_facet` at `after_turn_review.py:181`. Lessons: `MemoryService.write_lesson` via
  `/api/lessons` + after-turn review. `SkillUsageStore.all_usage()` is **deliberately unread** —
  "new/refined" is a provenance question answered by frontmatter `created_at`/`refined_at` plus
  `overlays.load_overlay` refinements (written by `proposals.accept` at `proposals.py:411`); use
  counts are LV-4's input and consuming them here would half-build its gather.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **ROUTE RAIL ADDED AT INTEGRATION — a defined handler is not a reachable one.**
  Every other test in the suite calls `api_learning_summary` directly, so deleting the
  `app.router.add_get` line left the whole suite green while the block would 404 in a real gateway.
  Measured at integration: unregistering the route reds only `test_agent_reference.py` (the offline
  reference render), which catches it *by accident* rather than by intent. Added
  `test_the_summary_route_is_actually_registered_not_merely_defined`, which builds an `Application`,
  calls `register_learning_routes` and asserts the canonical path is present — with a sibling
  assertion that an unregistered path is absent, so a matcher accepting everything fails. Vacuity
  proved: with the route line removed the new test reds
  (`assert '/api/learning/summary' in {...}`); restored, 15 passed.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **Judgment calls, recorded rather than buried.** (a) The block **hides itself**
  when `total == 0` or the route 404s (`learning.enabled` off) instead of rendering four zeros —
  "absent, never zeroed", pinned by mutation M7. On a fresh dev home nothing shows until a
  skill/proposal/facet/lesson exists inside the window. (b) `names` is capped at 8 with a `+N more`
  remainder while `count` is always exact (M6 pins that the count is not `names.length`).
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **Two pre-existing suites went red and were FIXED, not weakened.**
  `design/ariaProhibitedAttr.test.ts` flagged `<section aria-label>` with no explicit `role` — fixed
  by writing `role="region"` out (`LearningSummaryBlock.tsx:66`); semantically a no-op for a named
  section, but the HTML-AAM mapping is name-conditional and the ratchet is right to demand it be
  unconditional. `pages/listDestinationLoadError.test.tsx`'s shared api mock (its docstring: "everything
  these pages touch on mount") lacked `learningSummary`, and an unmocked method throws inside the
  fetcher — added it resolving `total: 0`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **A fixture that would have rotted, fixed.** The endpoint tests first stamped
  `created_at` against a frozen `NOW = 2026-08-20` while the endpoint reads the wall clock, so five
  days later the fixture had drifted outside the 7-day window and both tests failed. They now use
  `_iso_real()`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **Design vocabulary:** reused LV-2's non-interactive chip idiom (`<div title>`,
  `text-[0.75rem]`/`0.8125rem`, `fvs(600)`, count in the *visible* label because `title` is not an
  accessible name) inside a `Surface tone="low"`. No new idiom and no new component in `ui/`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-3] **Gate:** `make lint` clean (mypy **1012** source files);
  `test_lv3_learning_summary.py` **15 passed** (14 + the route rail); with
  `test_learning_routes.py` + `test_skills.py` + `test_skill_proposals.py` +
  `test_agent_reference.py` → **114 passed, 0 failed** (each path confirmed to exist first);
  `npm run typecheck:web` green; `npm run test:web` **483 files / 5128 tests passed**;
  `npm run build` green; `scripts/gate_report.py` 6/6 PASS; probe sweep 16, 0 introduced.
  `reference/routes.md` + `index.md` regenerated via `python -m gideon.manifest_reference`
  (**769 → 770 routes**) — a new route stales the offline reference.
  `docs/design/consistency-audit.json` churned on the vitest run (filesScanned 555 → 556, the new
  component; driftHits 8 and filesWithDrift 7 unchanged, i.e. **zero new drift**) and was reverted
  out of the commit.

## Execution log — `LV-5` (S3 refinement arm) — 2026-08-25

- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **IMPLEMENTED, status stays `todo` on ONE owner reading.** The stumble detector,
  the refine proposal with a unified diff, the daily cap and versioned acceptance all ship and are
  gated. See the DEVIATION below for the single clause in question.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **PREMISE CORRECTIONS — the briefing was wrong twice and verify-first caught both.**
  The brief cited `learning_summary.py` and `handlers/learning.py:513` as present; **neither exists at
  `fc597af4`** — LV-3 is on an unmerged branch, so those citations named a tree the agent was not
  standing on. Non-blocking, because LV-5's only intra-plan dep is `LV-1`, which IS on the base.
  Separately, **the refine accept path already existed**: `proposals.accept` has branched on
  `kind == "refine"` since WF2LEA-6 and applies a sidecar overlay rather than rewriting SKILL.md. So
  the atom's real gaps were narrower than its title reads: the deterministic trigger, the diff, the
  cap and the versioning.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **The stumble detector is model-free, and its negative behaviour is the design.**
  `after_turn_review.detect_stumble` (`:163`, vocabulary at `:147`) fires only when a skill's content
  actually reached the prompt, on three triggers: `correction`; `failure_retry` (a tool failed **and was
  invoked again later** — the retry is the evidence); `rejection` (a `denied` outcome that **never later
  succeeded**). It deliberately ignores: no skill loaded, either side reading as an environment failure,
  a failure nothing followed (an abandoned step is not a procedure gap), a denial the agent recovered
  from (steering, not refusal), and mid-sentence negations. **Known coverage limit, pre-existing:**
  `acp/outcomes.py` never emits `denied`, so `rejection` only fires on the native runtime.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **"Versioned" has a writer and two readers, and the version is a POSITION not a
  stored field** — a count kept beside its own collection can disagree with it. Writer:
  `overlays.apply_overlay` returns `len(refinements)` (`overlays.py:174`). Readers:
  `overlays.render_block` (`:194`) puts it in the loaded skill body, so two same-day refinements are
  distinguishable; `proposals.AcceptResult` (`:391`) → `handlers/skills.py:755`; the SEL accept row at
  `:752`; and `SkillProposals.tsx:135`. Verified at integration by mutation: forcing `apply_overlay` to
  return a constant `1` reds `test_two_accepted_refinements_are_distinguishable_by_version`
  (`assert 1 == 2`).
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **DEVIATION 1 — provenance lives in the overlay, not SKILL.md frontmatter. This is
  the one clause awaiting an owner reading.** The atom says "writes provenance frontmatter". WF2LEA-6
  made the base skill immutable precisely so `verify_skill_integrity` / `.pclaw-lock.json` stays valid;
  stamping frontmatter would break a marketplace-locked skill, and doing it only for `auto/` skills
  would be two paths for one guarantee. Provenance is therefore version + date + trigger in the rendered
  heading plus the SEL accept row. **If "provenance frontmatter" is read literally, this atom is PARTIAL
  and the clause needs re-scoping against WF2LEA-6's immutability guarantee; if provenance recorded
  where it CAN be recorded satisfies it, the atom is done.** Recorded rather than decided.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **DEVIATION 2 — the diff is derived at read time, not carried in `procedure_md`**
  (plan C3 suggested the latter). `procedure_md` must hold what accept *applies*; a diff stored there
  would be written into the overlay as garbage. Read-time derivation also cannot go stale, and an
  approval surface must never show a change the user is not getting — which is what the strongest guard
  asserts: building the diff from a second renderer reds with *"the diff shown to the user is not the
  change accept made"*.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **A real weakness the falsifications exposed, then closed.** Dropping the
  loaded-skill guard reded the correction-negative case, but only via an `IndexError` caught by an
  `except` — the call site was silent by accident rather than by construction. Closed with an explicit
  guard in `chat_runner.py`, and a further mutation (`used = used or ["release-flow"]`) reds the silence
  test on the guard itself.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **Three ratchets went red; all fixed, none weakened.** `uiDocs.drift` → added
  `web/src/ui/UnifiedDiff.doc.ts`. `scrollRegionNamed` → the `<pre>` is `tabIndex={0}` with a specific
  `aria-label` at each call site, because two regions both named "Diff" is an ambiguous name.
  `badgeCopyProse` → `refine` **converged out** of the exemption list: the pill renders
  `Refine · you corrected it` rather than the bare `kind`, so the now-inapplicable entry was removed.
  And `test_rendering_registry_parity` reded because the new prose *mentioned* `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  — reworded the comment rather than touching the rail, since a crude substring scan is the safe
  direction for a sanitizer-bypass gate.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **Other judgment calls, named:** the refinement body is derived from the turn's own
  record with no model call, so the arm degrades to *proposing nothing* rather than to a bad proposal —
  the cost is that `failure_retry`/`rejection` bodies are observations, not fixes, and the user gates
  them. The cap is a rolling 24h reading **both** halves (pending queue + accepted overlay timestamp),
  because calendar-day would let 23:59 and 00:01 both fire and queue-only forgets the moment the user
  accepts. `cfg.skill_ladder` is reused rather than adding a knob, since two knobs for one queue can
  disagree. `accept()`'s return type is a clean break (`str` → `AcceptResult`, 6 call sites updated).
  `_unified` is written locally in `refine.py` rather than importing `acp/translate.make_unified_diff`,
  because coupling `skills/` to the ACP protocol adapter for four lines of `difflib` points the
  dependency the wrong way.
- [2026-08-25][LV-5] **Gate:** `make lint` clean (mypy **1012** source files); `make test`
  **26556 passed, 30 skipped, 12 xfailed**; `test_lv5_refinement_arm.py` **21 passed**; at integration,
  re-run on the rebased tip with `test_wire_error_envelope_census.py` +
  `test_skill_proposals.py` + `test_after_turn_review.py` → **86 passed, 0 failed**;
  `npm run typecheck:web` green, `npm run test:web` **483 files / 5133 tests passed**, `npm run build`
  green; `gate_report.py` 6/6 PASS; probe sweep 16, 0 introduced.
  `docs/design/consistency-audit.json` churned `filesScanned` 555 → 557 (the two new web files) with
  `driftHits` 8 and `filesWithDrift` 7 **unchanged** — zero new drift, reverted out of the commit.

## Execution log — `LV-4` (T2.4 identity-report composer + T2.5 delivery) — 2026-08-25

- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **PARTIAL, deliberately.** T2.4 landed whole; T2.5 landed its *delivery*
  half (artifact + notify-gated inbox item + FE) and **not** its *schedule/config* half. The
  composer, the narrative pass, the no-model floor, the artifact, the inbox item, the quiet-hours
  gating and the Learning-page panel are all live and user-reachable. The **monthly clock job**
  and the **`learning.identity_report_*` config** are unbuilt — reasons recorded below, both
  outside this session's fence and one of them blocked by a rail.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **What exists:** `src/gideon/learning_report.py` (new) —
  `compose_identity_report` (deterministic, sync, read-only), `render_markdown`,
  `narrate_identity_report` (the ONE `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` call),
  `build_identity_report`, `delivery_dedup_key`, `deliver_identity_report`. Call sites:
  `GET /api/learning/identity-report` (deterministic preview, no model call) and
  `POST /api/learning/identity-report` (compose → narrate → versioned artifact → one attention
  item), both in `dashboard/handlers/learning.py` beside LV-3's `/summary`; the FE consumer is
  `web/src/pages/learning/IdentityReportPanel.tsx`, mounted on `LearningPage`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **DEVIATION 1 — `proposals_pending: int` became a section.** The plan's
  contract spelled it as a bare integer. Shipped as a `ReportSection` so its `count` is `len()`
  of the list it carries: a count maintained *beside* the thing it counts can disagree with it,
  and this repo has paid for that class before. Every section now has the same shape and no count
  in the module is stored independently of its rows.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **DEVIATION 2 — the window does not filter the sections.** The identity
  report is the *accumulated* shape (the amendment's own words: "the weekly digest shows deltas;
  the identity report shows the accumulated shape"), so a facet reinforced two years ago and still
  Active belongs in it. `window_days` labels the period and marks `used_in_window` per skill. A
  windowed gather here would have been a second copy of LV-3's block.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **PREMISE CORRECTION — the aging state is READ, never derived.** The plan
  names "curator aging states". `skills/curator.py` has no read accessor; the state lives in the
  SKILL.md `status` frontmatter and only `run_aging` (a writer) transitions it. So the report reads
  the PERSISTED status via `list_skills`. Deriving it from `last_used_at` would have claimed a
  skill was archived while surfacing still offered it.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **PREMISE CORRECTION — `SkillUsageStore.all_usage()` is ridden, not called
  twice.** `list_skills(with_usage=True)` already calls it. LV-3's log flagged use counts as
  "LV-4's input"; consuming them through the loader keeps one seam instead of two readers of one
  file.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **"Zero writes" is proved by OBSERVATION, with its own vacuity floor.**
  `_witness()` in the test file SHA-256s every file under `<home>/skills/` plus `memory.db`/`-wal`/
  `-journal` — written in the test, sharing no code with the subject, because a witness that
  certifies itself passes trivially. `test_the_witness_detects_a_write_so_its_silence_means_something`
  performs one real write and asserts the witness notices; only then do the two zero-write tests
  mean anything. **`memory.db-shm` is excluded and the exclusion is measured**: SQLite rebuilds the
  shared-memory file from the WAL on every connection, so its bytes moved across a pure read and
  the first draft of the guard was red for a non-write. `-wal` stays witnessed — a write that only
  reached the WAL is still a write.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **DISCOVERY — `compose_identity_report` is write-free for every LEARNING
  store, but `proposals.list_pending()` writes to the INBOX.** It calls
  `backfill_inbox_items()`, which raises a row for any pending proposal lacking one. That is the
  shared read path (LV-3's block calls the same function) and the inbox is not a learning store, so
  the criterion's "any learning store" holds. The exclusion is asserted explicitly in
  `test_the_witness_ignores_the_inbox_because_list_pending_backfills_it`, which also asserts the
  backfill still happens — so if that behaviour ever goes away, the stale exclusion fails loudly
  instead of quietly widening.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **Counts are tied to the STORE, not to a constant.** Each expected count is
  derived independently in the test: raw SQL (`key LIKE 'pref.facet.%'`, `key LIKE 'lesson.%'`,
  `is_deleted = 0`) for facets and lessons, a directory listing of `skills/auto/*/SKILL.md` for
  skills, and the `.proposals/*.json` records read by the test for proposals. Group sizes are
  deliberately asymmetric (3/2/4/2) so a section wired to the wrong gather cannot still agree.
  🪤 The proposal helper first read `skills/proposals` and returned **0**, which looked like an
  honest empty store; the dir is `.proposals` (dotted). It now asserts against
  `proposals._PROPOSALS_DIRNAME` so a rename fails loudly rather than reading as zero.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **Quiet hours, both directions, from ONE clock read.**
  `notification_allowed` reads the LOCAL wall clock and `DashboardState.notify` passes it no
  `now`, so `_window_around(offset_hours)` derives both windows from a single `datetime.now()` —
  the suppressing and delivering cases differ only in where the window sits. The delivering leg IS
  the vacuity floor, and it advances `now` a month because the dedup key is the calendar month
  (without that the second delivery would be swallowed as a duplicate and the floor would read
  like suppression was still in force).
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **The compressed-clock direction is covered as the DEDUP contract, not as a
  fired cron.** `test_a_second_delivery_in_the_same_month_reuses_the_row_and_does_not_re_ping`
  advances the clock across two same-month deliveries and one next-month delivery: same month →
  same inbox id, one notification; next month → a new id and a second notification (the vacuity
  floor for a constant dedup key). What is **NOT** covered is a trigger actually firing — see the
  unmet clause below.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **Ordering is the guarantee, not a promise.** `deliver_identity_report` writes
  the artifact BEFORE calling `emit_attention_item`, so "quiet hours suppresses the ping but not
  the artifact" is true by construction: the document is durable before delivery is attempted and
  `notification_allowed` can only drop the notification. An unchanged home mints no new artifact
  version (`store.update` does not dedupe a no-op, and an unconditional `snapshot=True` on a
  periodic run FIFO-prunes real history off the far end — `knowledge_render_provider._write_spec`'s
  measured finding).
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **The no-model floor is NAMED, not swallowed.** `one_shot_completion` returns
  a FALSY value rather than raising when nothing resolves, so both that and a raised provider error
  land on `narrative_status="unavailable"`, and `render_markdown` prints "No model was available to
  summarise this period. The figures below are complete and unaffected." The test asserts the
  deterministic payload is byte-identical across both no-model shapes, with a working-model control
  as the floor. An empty record spends no call at all (`skipped`, a different fact from
  `unavailable`). Lint map entry added: `learning_report.py → "assistant_reasoning"`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **The model is never shown a count.** `_narrative_facts` emits text only,
  fenced through `fence_untrusted` (facet text is user prose from a turn and can carry an
  injection). The surest way to stop a model misquoting a figure is to never show it one; the
  numeric sections are rendered from the gather verbatim and never round-trip through the model.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **FIVE import-bound stores had to be patched, and one of them was reading the
  developer's real home.** `skills.loader` resolves `config_dir` lazily, but `inbox`,
  `artifacts.native`, `providers.entity_routes` and `dashboard.state` all bind it at module scope.
  `DashboardState.__init__` calls `_load_notifications()`, so without the fifth patch a fresh state
  started pre-loaded with **six rows from the real `~/.gideon`** and `_persist_notification`
  appended the test's own deliveries to it. Every `_notification_log == []` assertion depends on
  that patch, and each redirect is asserted rather than assumed.
  `artifacts.registry._providers` is additionally a process-wide dict whose native entry freezes
  its root at first use, so it is replaced through `monkeypatch.setitem` rather than left for the
  next test to inherit.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **A fixture that was measuring its own stub, caught.** LV-3's `_memory`
  helper sets `embed_fn = lambda t: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]` — a CONSTANT, so every pair of lessons is
  100% cosine-similar and `write_lesson` drops the second as a >85% duplicate. Measured: the
  second `write_lesson` returned False and a two-lesson fixture stored one. Replaced with a
  one-hot embedding keyed on the text's own hash, which keeps the embedding path exercised while
  distinct texts stay orthogonal. Lesson texts are also semantically distinct because the store
  dedups on >50% topic-word overlap.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **OUT-OF-FENCE edits, each forced by a ratchet or a documented trap.** The
  session fence named `learning_report.py`, the learning modules, `web/src/pages/learning/**` and
  tests. Four files outside it were still touched, and none was optional:
  · `notification_kinds.py` (+1 `NotificationKind("learning","report",…)` **and** +1
    `_ATTENTION_FLAT` row) — `test_notification_kinds.py`'s AST sweep reds any literal
    `emit_attention_item` pair that is not registered, and without the wire-string row every
    delivery logged *"unregistered notification kind system/report"* and resolved to
    system/generic. That is the registry's own 🪤 case, one level down.
  · `web/src/pages/notifications/notificationMeta.ts` — `test_every_emittable_kind_has_a_frontend_row`
    went red on `['report']`. Measured, not anticipated.
  · `web/src/pages/inbox/inboxMeta.ts` — `refTarget`/`refLabel` had no `artifact` branch, so the
    inbox row carried `refs["artifact"]` and rendered no link. The branch is LAST in the chain and
    a test asserts a row carrying both a session and an artifact still routes to the session.
  · `web/src/lib/api.ts` — the two typed methods and the report's interfaces.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **UNMET CLAUSE 1 — the config, BLOCKED by a rail with zero headroom.**
  `learning.identity_report_enabled` / `identity_report_cadence` belong on `LearningConfig`
  (`config/loader.py:2072`). `loader.py` is **5900 lines against the 6000-line ceiling** that
  `test_structural_baseline.py` marks FORBIDDEN TO RAISE, and the rail demands ≥100 lines of
  headroom — so headroom is **exactly at the floor** and any new field reds the gate with nothing
  left to compress. `loader.py` was left untouched (verified: empty diff against `origin/main`).
  Consequences: no `cadence: monthly|weekly|off` and no "`off` disables cleanly". **Owner
  decision needed:** compress `loader.py` first, split `LearningConfig` into its own module, or
  raise the ceiling deliberately.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **UNMET CLAUSE 2 — the clock job.** "compressed-clock fixture fires the job"
  needs a `system:learning:identity-report` clock trigger, which in this tree means a registered
  action provider: `action_providers/registry.py`, `gateway.py` (the reconcile call),
  `guardrails/rungs.py` (the frozen grant), `triggers/screen.py` and `validation.py` — five shared
  registries, all outside the fence, plus the cadence config above that the trigger's schedule is
  supposed to converge on. Building it against a config field that cannot land yet would have
  produced a hardcoded schedule the config atom then had to rework, so both halves are left for
  one coherent follow-up. `deliver_identity_report` is the function that follow-up calls — the
  POST route and the cron will share it, so there is one owner, not two.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **Falsifications (mutate the live line, grep it back, observe, restore from a
  file copy at the literal path).** M1: `_gather_skills` calls `SkillUsageStore.record_use` — a
  real learning-store write through the production writer → **3 red**, both zero-write tests plus
  the no-model section-equality test. M2: `emit_attention_item`'s notify branch raises before
  `state.notify` → **2 red**, including `assert [] == ['report']`, which is the quiet-hours
  vacuity floor failing exactly as designed. M3: `if False and s.get("quiet_hours_enabled")` in
  `notification_allowed` → **1 red**, "quiet hours did not suppress the ping". Both directions of
  the quiet-hours claim are therefore falsifiable. (A first attempt at M1 wrote raw SQL and hit a
  NOT NULL constraint — a crash, not a write — so it was discarded and redone through the real
  writer; a mutation that raises does not falsify a zero-write guard.)
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **FOUR full-suite-only ratchets went red and were FIXED, not weakened.**
  Targeted runs never reach any of them, which is exactly the class the session brief warned about.
  · `test_wire_error_envelope_census.py` ×3 — the first draft used flat `{"error": str}` bodies for
  the four refusals, which pushed the flat population 1507 → 1511 and would have SPENT the
  unresolved slack LV-3 bought on error envelopes, the one thing that pin exists to forbid. Fixed at
  the root: all four refusals now go through `http_errors.json_error` (`learning_disabled`, appended
  to `HTTP_ERROR_CODES` — the registry is append-only, so the frozen baseline stays a subset; and
  the existing `bad_request` for the 400). The learning surface's FLAT count is therefore unchanged
  at 14. `UNRESOLVED_PAYLOAD_CEILING` 205 → **207** for the two 200-status SUCCESS bodies, with the
  same justification LV-3 recorded (a composer's return value; spelling its keys out would duplicate
  `IdentityReport`'s schema in two places), and the learning pin's `len(unresolved)` 4 → **6** with
  both new rows asserted `Call` and not-via-wrapper.
  · `test_agent_reference.py` — two new routes made the checked-in offline reference stale.
  Regenerated with `python -m gideon.manifest_reference`.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **TWO MORE full-suite-only reds, on the web side, both fixed at the root.**
  · `ui/disabledReasonTriage.test.ts` — the "Write it up" button gated on
  `busy || report.total === 0`, and `total === 0` is a state a user can ACT on, so the native
  `disabled` attribute makes a keyboard user tab past the action with no way to learn what is
  missing. Split the gate: `disabledReason` for the empty-record half (aria-disabled, focusable,
  announces the reason) and native `disabled` for the in-flight half — a reason on `busy` would
  make an in-flight action re-clickable, which the same suite separately forbids. The panel test
  now asserts the accessible OUTCOME (`aria-disabled` present, native `disabled` absent, and a
  click while unavailable delivers nothing) rather than a hover title.
  · `pages/learning/proposalCache.test.tsx` ×5 — the page gained a FIFTH read and the suite's
  `api` double omitted it, so `api.identityReport is not a function` threw inside a passive effect
  and surfaced as five failures about rows and cache keys. That is precisely the symptom the note
  above that mock block already documents, reproduced by read number five; stubbed with the same
  rejected-on-purpose posture as the other four.
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **A PRE-EXISTING red that is NOT this atom's, with the evidence.**
  `test_lv5_refinement_arm.py::test_v3_arc_flawed_skill_stumble_refine_approve_rerun` asserts a
  **hardcoded date**: `"## Refinement v1 (2026-08-25, from a correction)"` (line 534). The
  provenance stamp is UTC and the session ran at 17:xx PDT, so `date -u` already read
  **2026-08-26** while local read 2026-08-25 — the skill body carried `(2026-08-26, …)`. This
  atom touches none of its inputs (`git diff origin/main` is empty for
  `tests/test_lv5_refinement_arm.py`, `after_turn_review.py`, `skills/`, `history.py`), and it fires
  every day from ~17:00 PDT onward. Left unfixed — LV-5's test is outside this session's fence — and
  reported to the owner. **Fix: derive the expected date from the same clock the writer uses; do not
  re-pin the literal.**
- [2026-08-25][LV-4] **Gate:** `make lint` clean (mypy **1015** source files);
  `pytest tests/test_lv4_identity_report.py` **26 passed**;
  `tests/test_notification_kinds.py tests/test_resilience_degraded_lint.py
  tests/test_research_finding_kind.py tests/test_entity_settings_routes.py` **112 passed**;
  `npm run typecheck:web` green; `npm run test:web` green;
  `IdentityReportPanel.test.tsx` **8 passed** (its own falsification: rendering `lines.length`
  instead of the server `count` reds it); `scripts/gate_report.py` **6/6 PASS**, `structural-size`
  among them — which is the gate that would have caught a `loader.py` field. Full `make test`:
  **26658 passed / 6 failed** on the first run, then **26681 passed / 2 failed** on the re-run
  after every one of the six ratchet fixes landed. Both remaining reds are NOT this atom's:
  the LV-5 UTC date bomb above, and
  `test_inbound_mcp.py::TestTransport::test_rate_cap_returns_429_with_retry_after`
  (`assert 21 == 20` — a rate-cap timing count under 18-worker load; `git diff origin/main` is
  empty for `src/gideon/inbound/` and `tests/test_inbound_mcp.py`, and it **passes in
  isolation**, so it is a load flake, not a regression). Probe sweep 16, 0 introduced;
  `git status` clean.
  `docs/design/consistency-audit.json` churned `filesScanned` 562 → 563 (the new panel) with
  `driftHits` 8 and `filesWithDrift` 7 **unchanged** — zero new drift, committed as generated
  baseline movement caused by this change.

## Execution log — LV-4 (periodic identity report)

- [2026-08-26][LV-4] **PARTIAL — atom stays `todo`.** `src/gideon/learning_report.py` ships
  `compose_identity_report` (deterministic, sync), `render_markdown`, `narrate_identity_report` (the
  single `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")`), `build_identity_report`, `delivery_dedup_key`
  and `deliver_identity_report`, over five sections built from existing read seams: facets (decayed
  stability + live state), lessons, `auto/` skills (uses + recency + curator aging), pending proposals,
  and a memory-stats subset. Call sites that would be caught if deleted: `GET /api/learning/identity-report`
  (deterministic, no model call) and `POST /api/learning/identity-report` (compose → narrate → versioned
  artifact → one attention item), both in `dashboard/handlers/learning.py`, with a route-registration
  rail asserting both plus a vacuity sibling; the FE consumer is
  `web/src/pages/learning/IdentityReportPanel.tsx` on `LearningPage`, whose own test spies
  `api.deliverIdentityReport`, so the delivery path is not an inert control.
  **MET:** counts byte-match store contents; zero writes proven by an independent `_witness()` that
  SHA-256s every file under `<home>/skills/` plus `memory.db`/`-wal`/`-journal` and carries its own
  detection floor (a test performs a real write and asserts the witness notices); the no-model floor in
  both falsy and raised shapes; the inbox item lands linking the artifact; quiet hours suppresses the
  ping but not the artifact, falsified in both directions.
  **UNMET (why the atom does not flip):** the clock job actually firing, `cadence: monthly|weekly|off`,
  and "`off` disables cleanly". All three need one config field, `learning.identity_report_*`.
- [2026-08-26][LV-4] **BLOCKED on an owner decision — `loader.py` headroom.** `config/loader.py` is at
  **5900/6000 with headroom exactly 100 against a `>=100` rail**, so adding `learning.identity_report_*`
  reddens `structural-size` with nothing left to compress. The file is left untouched (empty diff vs
  `origin/main`) and `gate_report.py`'s `structural-size` passes. **Owner: compress `loader.py`, split
  `LearningConfig` into its own module, or raise the ceiling** (currently marked forbidden to raise).
  The clock job needs that cadence field plus five shared registries, so the config decision and the
  remaining three clauses are one coherent follow-up calling `deliver_identity_report`.
- [2026-08-26][LV-4] **DISCOVERY — `proposals.list_pending()` writes.** It calls
  `backfill_inbox_items()`, which writes **inbox** rows. Inherited from the shared read path (LV-3 calls
  the same function) and the inbox is not a learning store, so the zero-writes clause is unaffected —
  but the test asserts this explicitly, including that the backfill still happens, so a stale exclusion
  fails loudly rather than silently widening.
- [2026-08-26][LV-4] **DISCOVERY — `memory.db-shm` is excluded from the witness, and the exclusion is
  measured.** SQLite rebuilds it from the WAL on every connection, so its bytes move across a pure read.
  `-wal` stays witnessed.
- [2026-08-26][LV-4] **DEVIATION — a sixth `api` double needed updating.** Adding a `LearningPage` read
  breaks every suite that mounts the page with a partial `api` mock: five sites in
  `proposalCache.test.tsx` and, found at integration, `AblationPanel.test.tsx`
  (`TypeError: api.identityReport is not a function` at `LearningPage.tsx:92`, thrown inside a passive
  effect). That file's own header comment already states the rule; it simply predates this atom.
  **Six files now share an unenforced contract** — nothing fails until a sixth-party test mounts the
  page. A shared fixture exporting the page's full read set would collapse all six.

- [2026-08-26][LV-2] **OWNER RULING — the taste call is decided: the tap target must be reachable
  WITHOUT a disclosure.** The plan surfaced but did not decide (`LEARNING-VISIBILITY.md:358-361`)
  whether "a visible learned-chip whose tap lands on the right approve/edit surface" requires the link
  to be reachable without first expanding the collapsed `ContextLedger`. RULED: **yes.** A learning
  the user has to go looking for is not visible, and visibility is this plan's entire subject — a
  chip that points at something behind a closed disclosure moves the work from "hidden" to "hinted",
  which is not what the criterion asks for. Implementation is otherwise COMPLETE on main.
  REMAINING WORK, small and frontend-only: the chip's tap opens the disclosure and brings the
  approve/edit target into view in **one** action, asserted at the CALL SITE with a vacuity leg that
  fails when the disclosure stays closed. No backend change and no new WS/SSE channel. `LV-2` stays
  `todo` until that ships; it is no longer waiting on anyone.

- [2026-08-26][LV-4] **OWNER RULING — SPLIT the config sections, and the split is now `PHF-14`.** The
  atom offered three options for the blocked `learning.identity_report_*` field: compress
  `config/loader.py`, split `LearningConfig` out, or raise the ceiling. RULED: **split — and
  generalised beyond `LearningConfig`.** Raising the ceiling retires the very rail whose docstring
  predicted this arrival (`tests/test_structural_baseline.py::test_the_ceiling_leaves_the_biggest_file_room_for_ordinary_maintenance`,
  which names this file by name); compressing buys exactly one more field and then we are here again.
  Measured while ruling: `loader.py` is **5900** lines against an absolute **6000**-line ceiling with
  a `>= 100` headroom assertion, so headroom is exactly 100 and **one added line reds the gate**. The
  file was 5427 when that rail was written — it has since grown 473 lines and spent all of it. Because
  the config round-trip contract touches `loader.py` on every new field, this blocks *all* remaining
  user-facing configuration, not just `LV-4`. Filed as **`PHF-14`** in PLATFORM-HARDENING-FLOORS,
  which owns the size rails, and added as a dep of `LV-4`. `PHF-14` closes `LV-4`'s only unmet clause
  as its own proof-of-headroom step, so `LV-4` needs no separate session afterwards.

- [2026-08-26][LV-5] **OWNER RULING — "provenance frontmatter" does NOT require a literal frontmatter
  write; the reported deviation is RATIFIED.** Provenance recorded on the overlay record (version +
  date + trigger in the rendered refinement heading, plus the SEL accept row) satisfies the clause.
  Reasoning: `WF2LEA-6` made the base skill immutable precisely so `verify_skill_integrity` /
  `.pclaw-lock.json` stays valid, so stamping `SKILL.md` frontmatter would break a marketplace-locked
  skill; doing it only for `auto/` skills would be two paths for one concern, which the clean-break
  tenet refuses. The immutability guarantee is the stronger invariant and it wins. All four
  `done_when` clauses are therefore satisfied. `LV-5` stays `todo` for one mechanical reason only —
  the implementation is on `feature-lv5-refinement-arm` and is **not on main**. Flip it when that
  branch lands; no owner input remains.
## Execution log — `LV-7` (S4 benchmark implementation + publish) — 2026-08-26

- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **PREMISE CORRECTION — `LV-6`'s BLOCKING FINDING (G1) has CLEARED, and the
  atom's declared dep is still wrong in the other direction.** `LV-6` recorded "there is no way to
  run a skills-off arm today" and that `arm_mask` "appears nowhere in `src/`, `harness/` or
  `tests/`". At `ddaaefae` that is **false**: `evals/overlay.py` defines `ARM_AXIS = "arm_mask"`
  with a closed `on`/`off`/`cheap` arm vocabulary, `skills/suppression.py` is the child-side choke
  point, `evals/runner.py::_cell_overlay` reads the arm coordinate off each cell and hands the
  overlay to the child on the env COPY, and `evals/skills_bench.py` already builds the paired
  spec. So `ES-7`'s lever landed and G1 + G2 are closed. **G5 is also half-closed:** `run_matrix`
  now has production callers (`ablation.py`, `skills_bench.py`, reached from
  `gideon ablation`), so "no production caller" is stale — what was genuinely missing was a
  caller for THIS benchmark. `LV-7`'s row still declares `EXT:EVALUATION-SUBSTRATE:S1-2` and
  `dag.json` still maps that ext_ref to `ES-5`, whose row reads `todo` while `evals/studies.py`
  (1750 lines) + `evals/study_arms.py` (709) + `GET /api/evals/studies` are on `main`. Row left
  alone — the roadmap is owner-maintained.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **BUILT, riding the existing machinery rather than cloning it.**
  · **The ten scenario files** protocol §2.3 froze as a specification and left for this atom:
  `src/gideon/evals/library/sk_*.json`, all `version: 1`, `fixture_home: "empty"`,
  `dimensions: ["skill_impact"]`, deterministic assertions only. Verified installed in a fresh
  home as `origin: shipped` with 64-char `sha256`s.
  · **`src/gideon/evals/learning_bench.py`** — the frozen register, `task_set_fingerprint()`
  read off the library manifest (§2.3's mechanical anchor), `preflight()`, report I/O and
  `reproduction_check()`.
  · **`harness/learning_verdict.py`** — §5's sanctioned "thin sibling importing the same
  constants", and it goes further: it imports and CALLS `fanout_measure.compare()`, so the check
  order has exactly one implementation. The only thing added is a directional relabel
  (`fanout_wins`→`skills_on_wins`, `single_wins`→`skills_off_wins`); the three withheld verdicts
  pass through byte-identical, so the closed set does not grow.
  · **`scripts/learning_benchmark.py`** — THE one command, with `--preflight` / `--dry-run` /
  `--run` / `--check-reproduction`. `k` is read from `EvalsConfig.study_default_k` (G5 asked for
  exactly that) rather than hardcoded.
  · **`GET /api/evals/learning-benchmark`** + **`web/src/pages/learning/BenchmarkPanel.tsx`**
  rendered by `LearningPage` beside the ablation report, with the methodology link built from the
  report's own `protocol_doc`.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **G3 and G4 closed, both as the protocol described them.** G3: `tool_calls`
  was captured per turn and dropped by both aggregation boundaries — `child.py::tool_call_count`
  sums it into the payload. G4: `model_calls.jsonl` and the SEL log are written into the cell's
  `TemporaryDirectory` home and died with it — `child.py::spend_from_home()` reads the audit rows
  in the only process that can see them and folds them into the result. **Neither widened
  `CellResult`**: the parent already persists the whole child payload verbatim into
  `<artifact_ref>/result.json` under the real home, so the runner reads them from there. Widening a
  frozen primitive used by six modules for two fields would have been the expensive way.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **DESIGN RULE with teeth: the verdict is computed in `harness/` and WRITTEN
  into the report; `src/` only reads it.** `harness` is a repo-root dev package deliberately absent
  from the wheel (`pyproject.toml` packages `src` only), so a module under `src/` importing
  `fanout_measure` would strand an import at install time — and `mypy`'s `ignore_missing_imports`
  would not catch it. The consequence is the property the atom most needs: **no surface downstream
  is able to synthesise a verdict or a score**, so an unmeasured task is `verdict: null` end to end
  and renders "not measured". This is also why the runner is a `scripts/` entry point and not a
  `gideon` subcommand.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **"Stated variance" IS stated, and the citation ships with the payload.**
  Protocol §8: a re-run reproduces "when it uses the same task-set version, produces the same
  `scenario_sha256` set, records a pin whose `prompt_pack_sha256` and `config_snapshot_ref` match,
  and lands a verdict of the same class." It is **categorical, not numeric** — five equalities, no
  tolerance number anywhere. `REPRODUCTION_CONDITIONS` is that list verbatim and
  `stated_variance_source` cites `…learning-benchmark-protocol.md §8`, so a tolerance the code
  invented would be visibly missing its citation. Nothing here invents a number.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **MEASURED, at the entry point a user types** (isolated homes throughout, real
  home rail green): `python scripts/learning_benchmark.py --preflight` → **all 10 tasks runnable,
  suppression VERIFIED for all ten skills** (the direct falsification of `LV-6`'s G1);
  `--dry-run --trials 5` → **k=5 from `study_default_k`, 100 cells, `arms=['off','on']` on
  `arm_mask`, `fixture=empty` ×10**, and nothing written under `evals/learning_bench/`;
  `--run --task sk_grill --task sk_artifacts --trials 1` in an unbound home → both tasks SKIPPED
  carrying `run_matrix`'s own `incomplete RunPin (missing: model_fingerprint)` sentence, report
  written, `measured_tasks: 0`, stdout `NOTHING was measured`. The first `--run` attempt raised that
  refusal as a traceback; fixed to a per-task skip so one unpinnable task cannot abort the other
  nine.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **NOT MEASURED, deliberately: no paired arm was executed against a model.**
  The clause "paired runs are reproducible from one command against fixture homes" is met — the
  command exists, runs, and plans/executes the paired cells — but **no number was produced**, for
  two reasons stated rather than papered over. (1) An unbound home cannot record a benchmark result
  at all; `append_result`/`run_matrix` refuse an incomplete pin, which §3 calls correct behaviour.
  (2) The zero-cost way to bind a provider here is `llm/scripted.py`, and it replays
  **byte-identical output for the same script regardless of prompt** — both arms would score
  identically and the report would show a 0.0 delta. That is the precise fabricated comparison §1
  exists to prevent, so it was not run. No model was called and no cost was incurred.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **DISCOVERY — the §2.2 register's coverage claim is now stale (owner call, not
  acted on).** The register was frozen against an enumeration of **14** bundled skills.
  `src/gideon/skills/bundled/` now holds **16** (plus `__init__.py`): `document-authoring`,
  `research-campaign` and `web-verify` appeared after the freeze. All ten register skills still
  ship, so task set v1 is intact and every result stays comparable — but "one task per bundled skill
  family with a deterministic observable" no longer describes the whole tree. Expanding the register
  would mint **v2** and invalidate v1 for comparison (§2.3), so it was left alone;
  `test_every_register_skill_ships_as_a_bundled_skill` pins the direction that actually breaks a run.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **`V4` NOT MET, and it cannot be met by this session.** "An independent re-run
  reproduces within stated variance" requires an **independent party** — the owner or a CI nightly.
  The agent that produced the baseline cannot be that party, and re-running its own command twice
  would measure determinism, not independence. What is BUILT is the machinery V4 needs:
  `--reproduce <baseline_run_id>` judges a run against a baseline as it writes it,
  `--check-reproduction --reproduce A --against B` judges two existing reports, and the panel prints
  each condition with its citation. **Owner action to close V4:** run the command twice from
  independent homes (or wire the CI nightly variant) and record the outcome — §8 is explicit that a
  changed verdict class is a finding to publish, not a run to discard.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **T4.3 half NOT DONE:** the dashboard results page ships with its methodology
  link, but the **public site page** lives in the `gideon.dev` repository (outside this
  worktree) and the **honest README one-liner** was deliberately not written — there is no number to
  be honest about yet, and a README line announcing a benchmark with no result would be the
  overclaim this plan's soul guardrail forbids. Both are owner/next-session work.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **Falsifications — three, each RED with the mutation and GREEN after restoring
  from a file copy in the SAME invocation.** (1) Deleted `<BenchmarkPanel …>` from `LearningPage`
  (grep-back 0 hits) → `npm run test:web -- BenchmarkPanel` **1 failed / 12 passed** (only the
  call-site rail; the twelve direct-mount cases stayed green — the exact inert-route signature) →
  after restore **13 passed**. (2) `spend_from_home`'s absent-file branch returned
  `{"observed": True, "tokens": 0}` (mutation `ast.parse`d) → **1 failed / 27 passed** → after
  restore **28 passed**. (3) `conditions["same verdict class per task"] = True` → **2 failed / 26
  passed** (the parametrized vacuity case AND the unmeasured-reproduces-unmeasured trap) → after
  restore **28 passed**. Also recorded: `npx vitest run --config web/vite.config.ts <path>` reported
  **13 failed** on unmutated code (`setup 0ms` — no setup file, `sessionStorage` undefined); the same
  file under `npm run test:web -- BenchmarkPanel` is **13 passed**. Runner artifact, both numbers
  reported.
- [2026-08-26][LV-7] **Gate:** `make lint` clean (black 2099 files, isort, flake8, mypy **1031**
  source files over `src/gideon` AND `harness`); `gate_report.py` **6/6 PASS** (including
  `structural-duplication` — the sibling adds no second verdict implementation);
  `test_evals_learning_bench.py` **28 passed**, `test_harness_learning_verdict.py` **17 passed**,
  `test_evals_routes.py` **31 passed**, and `test_evals_{matrix_runner,pinning,harvest,study_arms,
  skills_bench,ablation}.py` + `test_agent_reference.py` **201 passed**; `npm run typecheck:web`
  green, `npm run test:web` **493 files / 5240 tests passed**, `npm run build` green.
  `node_modules` was absent on entry and `npm ci` was run first — the initial `typecheck:web` exit
  **127** was an UNRUN leg, not a pass. `reference/routes.md` + `index.md` regenerated via
  `python -m gideon.manifest_reference` (one route added, nothing else moved).
  `docs/design/consistency-audit.json` churned on the vitest run and was restored from a copy taken
  before the run. Probe sweep 16, 0 introduced.
