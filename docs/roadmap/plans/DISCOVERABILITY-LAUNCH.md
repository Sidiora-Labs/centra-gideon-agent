# DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/DL.md`](../atomic/DL.md) as 9 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Discoverability & Launch — Existing in Both Search Channels

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — S1 (claim + org migration) and S2 (docs site + machine-readable surface)
DONE; S3 (launch assets) mostly done; S4-S5 (comparison/listing program, research republication) not
started. Deepened 2026-07-18 (initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18; naming DECIDED: Gideon everywhere,
gideon.dev primary).
**S1 done:** the org with three public repos, metadata set, no live `keyurgolani/` URLs left,
gideon.dev over TLS with the CI quality floor.
**S2 done (website `main`, PR #20, 2026-07-31):** Astro + Starlight serves `/docs` from
`scripts/sync-docs.mjs`, a build-time sync of the pinned core docs — `src/content/docs/` is
gitignored, so the site commits no copies (the drift rail holds). `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt`,
sitemap and OG meta shipped. **The source manifest is now `channel: released` with core and apps both
pinned at v0.1.3 — the release flip is DONE**, the apps repo having been tagged v0.1.1-v0.1.3.
**S3 partial:** screenshots ship reproducibly (`docs/screenshots/{light,dark}/*` + `capture.mjs` +
`CAPTURE.md`) and the README/SHOWCASE rework landed. Still open: **T3.1's
`tests_fixtures/demo-home/` demo seed does not exist** (only `empty` ships, and `CAPTURE.md`
explicitly waits on it), the 60-90s capture, and T3.4's launch-post draft.
**Open OWNER tasks:** social-preview images on both repos, the Show HN / Reddit posting, and the S5
research-library preface approval. Status corrected 2026-08-04 by code audit.

## Context (verified 2026-07-18)

No domain/site/docs-site/demo; README screenshot is a placeholder (`docs/assets/screenshot-dashboard.png` referenced, absent); repos lack topics/homepage/social preview; `[project.urls]` absent (DISTRIBUTION T1.1). gideon.dev free (Google Registry RDAP); GitHub org `gideon` + PyPI + npm names free; gideon.com/.ai third-party-held. Owner decisions: zero-telemetry is a named marketing line; research-learnings republication deferred to the site (owner #15).

## Design

- **Website repo `gideon/gideon.dev`:** Astro + Starlight (static, fast, docs-native, MD/MDX — the docs tree drops in nearly verbatim; solid sitemap/SEO defaults; no runtime JS requirement). Structure: `src/content/docs/` populated **at build** by a sync script pulling `docs/{guides,reference,architecture,security}` + curated `research/learnings` from the core repo (git submodule or CI checkout — CI checkout preferred, no submodule friction); landing page + comparison pages authored in the site repo (they're marketing, not product docs); `public/install` (DISTRIBUTION T2.2's script), `public/llms.txt`, `public/llms-full.txt` (generated: llms.txt = curated index with one-line descriptions; llms-full = concatenated docs), OG/social images. Deploy: GitHub Pages via Actions (custom domain + HTTPS; zero external hosting accounts) — Pages is the default; any later host swap is invisible behind the domain.
- **Landing page above the fold:** category claim ("An agentic operating system for one person"), hero GIF, the bootstrap one-liner, badge row, three differentiator cards (security architecture → threat model; memory + knowledge depth; provider *and runtime* agnosticism/ACP), "**Zero telemetry** — your machine, your data, no phoning home" as a named feature card.
- **Launch assets:** screenshot set (dashboard home, chat with a tool-approval brief, loop cockpit mid-run, knowledge answer with citations, Store consent surface showing declared permissions) + a 60-90s silent capture (chat→approval→loop→knowledge→artifact/widget produced — the Canvas counter). Captured on a **seeded demo home** (`--seed` fixture; never the owner's real data). README rework: GIF above the fold, 3-command install, badges, highlights table, security section (plan 35 T2.4).
- **Comparison pages (S4):** `/compare/{peer-product}` pages — feature matrix + philosophy + honest "choose them if" columns. Claims about compared products carry retrieval dates; matrix rows only for verifiable public facts.
- **Listings (S4):** awesome-self-hosted + awesome-ai-agents PRs (follow each list's contribution rules), selfh.st, AlternativeTo; Show HN + r/selfhosted + r/LocalLLaMA — **gated on the P0 gate**: CI green, one-liner works, real screenshots live. Launch post: the architecture-receipts narrative citing the threat model.
- **Research republication (S5, owner #15):** curated learnings topics as a site section with a preface owning the built-agentically story.

## Contracts & artifacts (mostly doc/site artifacts; the two structured pieces pinned)

- **Docs-sync contract (`scripts/sync-docs.mjs`, site repo):** build-time only; checks out core `docs/{guides,reference,architecture,security}` → Starlight content. **The site repo commits NO copies of core docs** (drift rail — a link-check + a "no committed docs/ copies" CI assertion enforce it). One canonical source per the tenet.
- **`llms.txt` format:** the emerging convention — `# Gideon` H1, one-paragraph what-it-is, then `## Docs` with `- [Title](url): one-line` bullets for the key pages; `llms-full.txt` = build-time concatenation of guides+reference. Both at domain root, `text/plain`.
- **Comparison data (`src/data/comparisons.json`):** `{product, claims:[{feature, gideon, them, source_url, retrieved:"<ISO>"}]}` — **every compared-product claim carries a source URL + retrieval date** (anti-staleness + honesty rail).
- **Integration points:** consumes DISTRIBUTION's `/install` script (T2.2), SECURITY-LEGIBILITY's threat-model, LEARNING-VISIBILITY's benchmark results, the research-learnings corpus (owner #15). Org/domain owner tasks gate S1.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — Claim + org migration (executes with PUBLICATION S1)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | (Owner-led, see owner tasks 1-3) org created, repos transferred, domain registered — executor verifies redirects + updates any hardcoded `keyurgolani/` URLs in both repos (grep sweep) | both repos: grep `keyurgolani/` → replace with `gideon/` | grep clean; old URLs 301 to new |
| T1.2 | Repo metadata: descriptions + topics per PUBLICATION S1.5 list; homepage=https://gideon.dev on both | GitHub settings (executor via `gh repo edit`) | `gh repo view` shows all fields |
| T1.3 | Scaffold `gideon/gideon.dev`: Astro+Starlight init, Pages deploy workflow, domain config (CNAME), empty-but-styled landing | new repo | site serves at gideon.dev over HTTPS |
| T1.4 | Docs sync script: CI step checks out core repo, maps `docs/{guides,reference,architecture,security}` into Starlight content with nav; drift check = sync is build-time only, site repo contains no committed copies of core docs | site repo: `scripts/sync-docs.mjs`, workflow | site rebuild reflects a core docs edit with no manual step; repo tree has no doc copies |
| V1 | Validation: gideon.dev serves landing + docs sections; lighthouse pass ≥90 perf/SEO; no tracker requests in the network tab | — | holds |

### Session 2 — Docs site + machine-readable surface

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Information architecture: Guides / Reference / Architecture / Security / Roadmap(link to repo) nav; getting-started is the docs landing | site repo config | every core doc reachable ≤2 clicks; internal links resolve (link-check step in site CI) |
| T2.2 | `llms.txt` (curated: project one-liner, install, key doc URLs with one-line descriptions) + `llms-full.txt` (build-time concatenation of guides+reference) at domain root | site repo: generation in `sync-docs.mjs` | both fetch with correct content-type; llms-full regenerates per build |
| T2.3 | Landing page per Design (hero copy, one-liner, differentiator cards, zero-telemetry card, footer links incl. threat model + SECURITY.md) | site repo | copy matches Design; all links live |
| T2.4 | Sitemap + OG/social meta + per-repo social-preview images (1280×640: name, tagline, coral identity per `web/DESIGN.md` palette) | site repo + image assets; upload via repo settings (owner task 5) | rich embeds render in a link-preview checker |
| V2 | Validation: `curl gideon.dev/llms.txt` sane; Google Rich Results test passes on landing; docs search (Starlight default) returns getting-started for "install" | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Launch assets

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | Build the demo seed fixture: believable non-personal data (a project, tasks, a knowledge doc set, memory entries, one loop) for screenshot/GIF capture | core repo: `tests_fixtures/demo-home/` (follow existing fixture layout) | `gideon gateway --seed demo-home` boots a demo-ready dashboard |
| T3.2 | Capture the five screenshots + the 60-90s GIF/MP4 per Design list (owner performs capture if executor lacks a display; script the click-path either way as `docs/assets/capture-script.md`) | core repo: `docs/assets/*.png`, site repo hero media | README placeholder replaced; assets referenced from site hero |
| T3.3 | README rework (core): GIF above fold, badges, 3-command install, highlights, security section; apps-repo README gets badges + org links | `README.md` both repos | a 30-second skim answers what/why/how-to-install |
| T3.4 | Launch post draft: architecture-receipts narrative (security-first personal agent; cite threat model, scanner gate, egress chokepoint, zero telemetry; honest limitations paragraph) | site repo: `src/content/blog/launch.md` (or docs section if no blog collection) | draft complete; owner sign-off pending (owner task 6) |
| V3 | Validation: fresh-eyes pass — a person who's never seen the project reads README + landing for 60 seconds and can say what it is and how to install (test on one human or as a structured self-review against those two questions) | — | recorded in Execution log |

### Session 4 — Comparison + listing program (Wave 1)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4.1 | Comparison matrix data file (claims + sources + retrieved dates) then `/compare/{peer-product}` pages rendered from it | site repo: `src/data/comparisons.json` + pages | every compared-product claim has source+date; "choose them if" section present on both |
| T4.2 | Listing submissions: PRs to awesome-self-hosted + awesome-ai-agents per their CONTRIBUTING rules; selfh.st + AlternativeTo entries drafted (owner submits where accounts are needed) | external + `docs/roadmap/plans/` Execution log records URLs | PRs open; entries drafted with copy + links |
| T4.3 | Launch checklist doc: the P0 gate items + posting plan (Show HN title/body draft, r/selfhosted + r/LocalLLaMA post drafts adapted per community norms) | site repo: `launch-checklist.md` (internal) | drafts ready; gate items each link to their proof (CI badge, install VM log, screenshots) |
| V4 | Validation: comparison pages fact-checked against sources; gate checklist all-green before any owner posting | — | holds |

### Session 5 — Research republication (Wave 1+, owner #15)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T5.1 | Curate learnings topics for publication (all 14 unless owner trims), preface owning the built-agentically story + how the corpus is used | site repo section via sync script extension | topics render; preface approved (owner task 7) |
| V5 | Validation: spot-check three topics render with intact cross-links | — | holds |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **Register gideon.dev** (any registrar; ~$12/yr) and point DNS at GitHub Pages (A/AAAA + CNAME per Pages docs) — before S1.
2. **Create the `Gideon` GitHub org** and **transfer both repos** (Settings → Transfer; org must exist first; plan for a few minutes of Actions re-enable per repo post-transfer).
3. **Reserve PyPI/npm names** if DISTRIBUTION hasn't already (placeholder publishes).
4. Decide on pursuing **gideon.com/.ai** from their current holders (lookup → offer) or explicitly dropping them — record the decision.
5. **Upload social-preview images** to both repos (Settings → Social preview) when T2.4 produces them.
6. **Sign off the launch post** and personally make the Show HN / Reddit posts (community norms favor the author posting; timing your call once the gate is green).
7. **Approve the research-library preface** (S5) — it publicly owns the AI-built story; that's your voice to approve.
8. Optional: order stickers. (Kidding. Unless.)

## Risks & open questions

- **Site/docs drift** — mitigated structurally (build-time sync, no committed copies, link-check CI).
- **Comparison pages age** — the data file carries retrieval dates; refresh cadence = each release, checklist item in release.yml notes.
- **Open:** blog collection vs docs-only Starlight — default: enable Starlight's blog only if the launch post wants an RSS feed (it does — LLM crawlers and aggregators both consume RSS; ship it).

## Execution log

### 2026-08-16 — `DL-4` (T3.1) demo-home seed fixture — **PARTIAL / BLOCKED**

**Landed.** `src/gideon/tests_fixtures/demo-home/` now ships a home that reads as used:
two authored projects with briefs (`Reading Pipeline`, `Home Server`) plus the two builtins
(`Personal`, `Repeatable`) pinned at fixed ids, three task lists, ten tasks spanning
`open`/`in_progress`/`done`/`blocked`/`cancelled` with exit criteria, action plans and notes,
one dependency edge that resolves to a real derived block reason, and markdown memory
(`preferences.md`, `projects.md`, two days of `history/`). A minimal `config.json` sets
`dashboard.user_name` so the home boots past onboarding. New rails in
`tests/test_seed_demo_home.py` (11 tests). Docs updated: `docs/reference/cli.md` gains a
fixture table, and `CAPTURE.md` + `capture.mjs` no longer instruct a `--seed demo` fixture
that never existed.

**BLOCKED on the done_when's other half — knowledge docs and one loop.** The done_when also
requires knowledge docs, memory *records* and one loop. All three of those stores are
SQLite-only, and `--seed` is a bare `shutil.copytree` (`seed.py:269`) with no hydration hook,
so there is no text representation for a fixture to carry:

- **Knowledge** — `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db` only (`knowledge/store.py:221`), 35-column
  `items` plus **external-content FTS5 with no triggers**, and the store refuses to open at all
  without FTS5 (`store.py:235`). `workspace/knowledge/files/` holds upload bytes reached through
  an **absolute** `file_path`, so a baked-in path from another home 404s. No boot-time re-ingest
  from any file. Extra hazard: a row left at `processing_status='queued'` is re-run through the
  full enrichment graph on every boot (`ingest_queue.recover_pending()`).
- **Memory records** — `semantic_memory` / `episodic_memories` in `memory.db`. `memory-vault/`
  is a projection that is **never read** by default (`vault_mode` defaults to `off`), and in
  `mirror` mode a hand edit is overwritten. The markdown tier we DID author is a genuine,
  first-class surface (it renders in the Memory studio and feeds the memory graph — measured,
  23 graph nodes), but it is explicitly "a view, not a parallel store" (`memory.py:50-57`).
- **Loops** — hybrid, and the SQLite half is the mandatory half: `loop/loops.db` holds the row,
  and `reap_orphan_dirs()` **deletes any `loop/<8hex>/` directory with no backing DB row at
  gateway boot** (`store.py:1215-1241` via `manager.py:604`). So a text-only loop fixture is
  silently wiped on first boot. Findings/verdicts are projected off `events.jsonl`, not off
  `findings/*.json` (which is ingest-only). Also: never seed `status='running'` or `'planning'`
  — boot re-arms them and spends real model calls.

The options, for the owner: **(a)** commit prebuilt `.db` files into package data (works today,
`copytree` handles it, but it is reviewable-as-binary, rots silently on any schema change, and
has no in-repo precedent); **(b)** give `seed` a post-copy hydration step that replays a
declarative JSON manifest through the real writers (keeps the fixture text-only and
schema-proof, but it is new machinery and a design decision beyond this atom); **(c)** leave the
fixture text-only and document the two-command manual top-up for capture, which is what
`CAPTURE.md` now says. `DL-4` stays `todo` in `dag.json`/`DL.md` because the done_when is not met.

**DISCOVERY (packaging, fixed here).** `pyproject.toml`'s package-data glob was
`tests_fixtures/*/*` — exactly one level deep. It covered `empty/fixture.yaml` and nothing else,
so every nested file this fixture needs would have been **silently absent from the wheel**: a
source checkout looks perfect and only a real `pip install` shows the fixture half-missing.
Widened to `tests_fixtures/**/*` and **proved against a built wheel**, not against the config:
a 4-level probe file appeared at `gideon/tests_fixtures/globprobe/a/b/c/deep.txt` inside
`python -m build --wheel` output. Backed by a coverage rail that walks the real tree and names
every uncovered file, plus a vacuity floor asserting the fixture is actually nested (a coverage
check over a flat tree would pass while the bug is wide open).

**Verified as a user** (isolated home, `--seed demo-home --seed-replace`, port 10055, real
browser): Home greets "Good afternoon, Alex" with 6 open tasks and a task counter of 6; the
Tasks list renders all ten with project labels, priorities, criteria counts (2/3, 1/2, 1/1, 2/2),
tags, strikethrough on done and the cancelled row distinct; Projects lists all four with
`builtin` badges and list counts; the Memory studio shows all three markdown documents and a
23-node graph carrying the authored prose. Zero console errors, zero gateway-log errors.
**Not verified because deliberately absent:** Knowledge (0 items), loops (0 — "No active work"),
and the Semantic/Episodic/Events/Embedded tiles all read 0.

**Known limitation.** The fixture's timestamps are static (mid-August 2026), so relative-time
labels drift as the fixture ages. Refresh them when the launch capture is taken.

### 2026-08-17 — `DL-4` (T3.1) demo-home seed fixture — **DONE**

Closes the half the 2026-08-16 entry left `BLOCKED`. The done_when is now met end to end:
`--seed demo-home` boots and every surface it names is **served**, measured on a live gateway.

**Correction to the premise this session started from.** `demo-home` was never missing a "seed
registry" — `_resolve_fixture` (`seed.py:124`) lists directories under `tests_fixtures/`, so
the fixture has been resolvable since it landed. `--seed demo-home` already booted; two
surfaces were simply empty. Measured baseline before this change, live boot: projects 4,
tasks 10, **knowledge 0, loops 0**.

**What changed.** The 2026-08-16 entry's option **(a)** — ship the SQLite halves as package
data — with the objection to it answered rather than accepted. Both `.db` files are generated
by driving the **real writers** (`KnowledgeStore.create_typed_item`, `loop.store.create`) from
`scripts/generate_demo_home_fixture.py`, so the schema is correct by construction rather than
hand-transcribed, and a schema change is a re-run rather than a hand-patch. Added:

- `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db` — five docs (3 notes, 2 bookmarks) themed to the existing
  `Reading Pipeline` / `Home Server` projects. Text/url only, no `file_path`, so no absolute
  path from the generating machine is baked into the wheel. URLs use RFC 2606 `example.com`.
- `loop/loops.db` + `loop/a17c3f92/status.json` — one `research` loop, 3-phase plan with exit
  criteria per phase, scoped to `p-2d6f5c83` (`Reading Pipeline`), 6 cycles, `status=complete`.

**Three landmines the measured shape forced, each now a rail in `tests/test_seed_demo_home.py`
(19 tests, was 11):**

1. **WAL.** Both stores open `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`, so the writes sit in a `-wal` sidecar.
   Committing the bare `.db` without `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` ships a fixture that boots
   **empty** — the exact failure this atom exists to prevent. The generator checkpoints; a test
   asserts no sidecar ships and that neither `.db` embeds a generation-machine path.
2. **The orphan reap is real.** `reap_orphan_dirs()` deletes any `loop/<8hex>/` dir with no
   backing row at boot. A test calls it against the seeded home and asserts it reaps **0** —
   proving the shipped dir is row-backed rather than about to be wiped.
3. **`items_fts` is external-content FTS5 with no triggers**, so its index is only populated by
   the real writer. A hand-built `knowledge.db` would list fine and return nothing for every
   search — a demo whose search box looks broken. A test searches for a term the fixture
   contains, so that failure mode cannot ship silently.

Also: the seeded loop is pinned **terminal** (`complete`) by a test, because a seeded `running`
or `planning` loop is re-armed at boot and would spend real model calls on the machine of
whoever ran `--seed demo-home` just to look at a demo.

**Measured from a live boot** (`GIDEON_HOME` on a throwaway tmp home, port 10441,
`AUTH_MODE=none`): projects **4**, tasks **10**, knowledge **5** (`/api/knowledge/stats` agrees:
`items=5`), memory graph **23 nodes**, `preferences` **901 chars**, loops **1**.
`GET /api/loops/a17c3f92` parses fully (`kind=research`, 3 plan phases, `project_id` resolves to
a fixture project, 6 cycles) and the loop dir survived the boot reap. `test_every_demo_surface_is_non_empty`
carries a count floor per surface so an empty response cannot read as success.

**Packaging.** `pyproject.toml` needed no change — the glob is already `tests_fixtures/**/*`
(widened on 2026-08-16). Verified against a real wheel rather than assumed: **27 fixture files
on disk, 27 in the wheel, none missing**, including the new depth-4
`demo-home/loop/a17c3f92/status.json`.

**Falsified.** (a) Renaming the fixture dir → `SeedError: unknown fixture: 'demo-home'.
Available fixtures: demo-home-DISABLED, empty.` and the suite goes 2 failed / 15 errors, all
naming the fixture — not a silent pass. (b) `DELETE FROM items` in the committed
`knowledge.db` → 3 targeted reds, including
`these demo surfaces are empty: ['knowledge'] (counts={... 'knowledge': 0 ...})`. Both restored
from file copies.

**Docs corrected, because both stated the opposite of reality after this change:**
`docs/reference/cli.md`'s fixture table and `docs/screenshots/CAPTURE.md`'s prerequisite both
said knowledge items and loops are *not* carried and told the capture operator to drive those
two by hand. Semantic/episodic memory **records** remain genuinely absent — that store is
SQLite-only with no text tier — and both docs now say only that.

**Still open, unchanged:** the fixture's timestamps are static (mid-August 2026), so
relative-time labels drift as it ages. Refresh them when the launch capture is taken.
