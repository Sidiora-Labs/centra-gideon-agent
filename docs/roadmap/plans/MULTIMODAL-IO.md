# MULTIMODAL-IO

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/MI.md`](../atomic/MI.md) as 5 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Multimodal I/O — Voice Profiles, Cloning TTS, Duplex Hardening, Screen-Context Channel

**Status:** PROPOSED (created 2026-07-13 from research synthesis, promoted from backlog)
**Created:** 2026-07-13
**Wave:** 2-3 — rides LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 (Wave 0): the cloning engine ships as a sidecar-isolated local provider using LMM-V2's execution modes, catalog contract, and capability matrix. §5 (screen share) is v2-independent but shares this plan's multimodal chat surface.
**Depends on:** LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 (sidecar runner §3, `CapabilityMatrix` §2.1, `catalog.json` §2.3, selftest §6). Nothing here blocks or is blocked by the WORKFLOWS-V2 program.
**Scope:** promote voice from a piper-voice-name string to a first-class `voice_profiles` entity (clone/design kinds, lock-from-history, consent-as-provenance); a cloning-capable TTS engine evaluated as a provider beside piper; per-channel/per-subagent voice bindings with an explicit precedence chain; a duplex-loop hardening pack (confirmation gating, echo filter, STT mute, pre-TTS cleaning); and an opt-in ephemeral screen-share context source for interactive chat — observation only, nothing persisted unless pinned.

---

## Research Integration (2026-07-13)

- **NEW-9** (voice_profiles entity: kind clone|design, ref_audio+ref_text, seed, lock-from-history, consent-as-provenance; `supports_cloning`/`supports_voice_design` capability flags; cloning engine beside piper; per-channel/per-subagent voice bindings with explicit > binding > default > built-in precedence) → §1, §2, §3. Sources: `omnivoice-studio` (entity schema, lock flow, consent columns, MCP client-binding precedence — all verified in OmniVoice source), `moss-audio` (capability-matrix reinforcement).
- **NEW-9 amendment** (voice duplex-loop hardening pack: confirmation-phrase execution gating, TTS-echo filter with 3-consecutive-word match, STT mute during TTS playback via start/stop callbacks, pre-TTS text cleaning stripping code/URLs/paths/flags, voice-origin "transcription may be inaccurate" disclaimer) → §4. Source: `agenticseek` (working implementation of every mechanism).
- **NEW-28** (opt-in ephemeral screen-share as chat context — observation only, no control, visible indicator, nothing persisted unless pinned; explicitly DISTINCT from the approved AUTO-R20 `observe` trigger kind) → §5. Source: `tryfriday`.
- **Overlap honored:** NEW-9's LocalModel contract extensions land as *additions to* approved LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 mechanisms (NEW-8), never as parallel machinery — §2 states each extension against the LMM-V2 section it rides. NEW-28 references approved **AUTO-R20** (WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §1.2 `observe` trigger kind: background capture daemon → idle filter → batched extraction, Phase 2, app-delivered); this plan builds ONLY the live interactive-session remainder (§5.1 states the boundary). The `.ovsvoice`-style portable signed bundle is deliberately **deferred to NEW-12** (Agent Packs & Portable Bundles) — export/import of voice profiles belongs to the general bundle format, not a one-off (§7).

## Overview

Gideon already has a working but *minimal* voice surface, and no screen-context surface at all. Verified starting points (code read 2026-07-13):

- **TTS inference axis:** `tts/provider.py:28 TtsProvider` — `synthesize(text, voice="", output_path="", *, speed=1.0, **opts)`; `LocalTtsProvider` (:75) mixes in `LocalModelProvider` and bridges downloadable voices to the uniform local-model contract (`list_voices → list_models`). Piper subclasses `LocalTtsProvider`; OpenAI TTS subclasses plain `TtsProvider`. The two axes (inference vs management) are independent by design.
- **Voice resolution today is a flat triple, not an entity:** `tts/registry.py:113 active_voice_params()` resolves `{provider, voice, speed, speech_voice, enabled, auto_speak}` from `active_models.json` `tts` binding + `~/.gideon/extensions/use_case_settings/tts.json`. `voice` is a bare string (a piper `.onnx` name or a hosted persona id). There is no seed, no reference audio, no history, no per-surface variation — the exact gap NEW-9 names.
- **Synthesis endpoint:** `dashboard/chat_voice.py:api_voice_synthesize` (`POST /api/voice/synthesize`, wired at `dashboard/server.py:693`) — sentence-chunked streaming via `voice_reply.streaming_voice_reply`, broadcasting `voice_chunk`/`voice_complete` WS events. It already runs `redact_exfiltration_urls` + `redact_credentials` on the text — the pre-TTS cleaning pass (§4.3) extends this exact spot.
- **STT endpoint:** `POST /api/stt/transcribe` (`dashboard/handlers/core.py:83`, route `dashboard/server.py:474`). The FE mic drives it; there is no duplex loop discipline (no echo filter, no mute-during-playback, no confirmation gating).
- **Name collision to avoid:** `AgentConfig.voice` (`config/loader.py:813`) is the agent's *persona text* rendered through the `agent-voice-layer` prompt snippet (`_compose_voice`, loader.py:111) — it has nothing to do with TTS. This plan's entity is named `voice_profiles` and the binding store `voice_bindings.json`; no field named bare `voice` is added anywhere near config to keep the two axes unconfusable.
- **Vision path for screen frames:** the `image_modality` use-case exists and resolves through the standard bridge (`providers/use_cases.py:39`; `provider_bridge.py:34 _CAPABILITY_TO_ENUM` maps it to VISION). The knowledge pipeline already consumes it (`knowledge/pipeline/graphs.py:61`). Chat attachments are injected per-turn by `chat_runner.py:646 _inject_attachment_content` (uploads-dir files only) — the screen-frame injection seam (§5.3) is a sibling of this function, not a fork of the chat loop.
- **What LMM-V2 gives us to ride:** sidecar execution mode (`ProviderConfig.execution: "sidecar"`, LMM-V2 §3) for the torch-heavy cloning engine; `CapabilityMatrix` on `LocalModel` (LMM-V2 §2.1) to carry the new flags; `catalog.json` model cards (§2.3) for the engine's models; the real-inference selftest (§6) to prove cloning actually runs.

**Soul guardrail:** one user, one machine. Voice cloning here is *your own voice or voices you have reference audio for*, on your hardware, with consent recorded as provenance — no gallery, no sharing service, no watermark infrastructure (that belongs with NEW-12's bundle format if profiles ever ship off-machine). Screen share is your screen, to your configured model, with a visible indicator, and it evaporates when you stop. Learning derived from either surface stays propose-don't-write (LEARNING-FLYWHEEL's queue).

## 1. The `voice_profiles` Entity

### 1.1 Schema and store

Per-entity JSON files, following the tasks pattern (recon: persistence-security — per-entity JSON + `atomic_write`, no sqlite for entity families):

```
~/.gideon/voice_profiles/
  vp-<8hex>.json                 # the profile record
  vp-<8hex>/ref_audio.<ext>      # reference clip (clone kind)
  vp-<8hex>/locked.wav           # lock-from-history artifact (§1.2)
  vp-<8hex>/consent.<ext>        # consent recording (§1.3)
  vp-<8hex>/history/<n>.wav      # bounded generation history (last 10, LRU)
```

```python
@dataclass
class VoiceProfile:
    id: str                      # vp-<8hex>, server-generated
    name: str
    kind: str                    # "clone" | "design"
    provider: str                # app name of the engine that renders it ("piper-tts", "omnivoice-tts")
    model: str                   # engine voice/model id (piper .onnx name, engine model id)
    # clone kind:
    ref_audio: str = ""          # relative path inside the profile dir
    ref_text: str = ""           # transcript of the reference clip
    # design kind:
    design_params: dict = ...    # engine-interpreted category picks (gender/age/accent/pitch/emotion)
    instruct: str = ""           # sanitized freeform style instruction
    # shared:
    seed: int = 0                # 0 = unseeded
    language: str = ""
    speed: float = 1.0
    locked: bool = False         # §1.2
    # consent-as-provenance (§1.3):
    verified_own_voice: bool = False
    consent_text: str = ""
    consent_audio: str = ""      # relative path; verification requires the artifact
    consent_recorded_at: str = ""
    created_at: str = ""
```

- **Kind semantics:** `clone` profiles carry `ref_audio + ref_text` and require a provider whose capability matrix declares `supports_cloning` (§2.1); `design` profiles carry `design_params + instruct` and require `supports_voice_design`. A plain piper voice is representable too: `kind: "design"` with empty params — every existing voice selection migrates losslessly (§6 migration).
- **CRUD surface:** `GET/POST /api/voice/profiles`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/voice/profiles/{id}`, multipart ref-audio upload riding the existing resumable-upload store (`dashboard/handlers/uploads.py`) with `target: voice_profile`. Profile ids validated `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`-style with symlink-resolved containment under the profiles dir (OmniVoice's CWE-22 idiom; same posture as the uploads store).
- **Entity events:** profile mutations broadcast typed WS events (`voice_profile_created/updated/locked/deleted`) via `DashboardState.broadcast_ws` — the same single-surface eventing chat uses today. When AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's entity-CRUD bus lands, these become bus events for free (its Phase 1 already plans entity-CRUD sources).

### 1.2 Lock-from-history — freeze the voice you liked

Every synthesis routed through a profile appends `{path, seed, text_hash, created_at}` to the profile's bounded generation history (last 10, files LRU-pruned). `POST /api/voice/profiles/{id}/lock {history_index}` copies that generation's audio to `locked.wav`, pins its `seed` into the profile, and sets `locked: true`; unlock clears both. While locked, the resolver (§3) always passes the pinned seed, and for clone-capable engines the locked audio becomes the reference-conditioning input — "the voice I got on Tuesday" becomes reproducible instead of a diffusion lottery. This is OmniVoice's verified lock flow (`POST /profiles/{id}/lock` copying a `generation_history` item + pinning seed) adapted to file-store PClaw.

### 1.3 Consent-as-provenance

Copied from OmniVoice's verified design, scoped down to personal use:

- Consent columns are **provenance, not biometrics**: `verified_own_voice` may only flip true when an actual consent recording exists (≥1s audio artifact AND non-empty `consent_text`) — recomputed from the files on read, never trusted from a hand-edited JSON flag (the non-forgeable rule).
- **Gating rule:** consent gates only *agentic and off-machine* features — a subagent/channel binding (§3) to a clone-kind profile of a real person's voice warns without `verified_own_voice`; a future NEW-12 bundle export of a clone profile *requires* it. **Plain local synthesis is never gated** — the user typing "read this aloud" on their own machine is not an ethics checkpoint.
- Consent record/revoke are explicit endpoints (`POST /api/voice/profiles/{id}/consent`, `DELETE …/consent`), SEL-audited (`sel.py`) like other trust-relevant transitions.

## 2. Provider Capability Flags + a Cloning Engine Beside Piper

### 2.1 `supports_cloning` / `supports_voice_design` — where they live

Two homes, both additive, honoring the LMM-V2 contract it rides:

1. **Per-model:** LMM-V2's `CapabilityMatrix` (LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 §2.1, `local_models/provider.py`) gains two fields: `supports_cloning: bool = False`, `supports_voice_design: bool = False`. They ride `catalog.json` model cards and `GET /api/models/available` into the FE exactly as LMM-V2 specifies — no new payload plumbing.
2. **Per-provider (inference axis):** `TtsProvider` (`tts/provider.py:28`) gains non-abstract class attrs `supports_cloning: bool = False`, `supports_voice_design: bool = False`, plus one optional kwarg surface: `synthesize(..., ref_audio: str = "", ref_text: str = "", seed: int = 0, instruct: str = "", design_params: dict | None = None)` — all defaulted, threading through the existing `**opts` convention so piper/OpenAI implementations compile unchanged. Features gate on the flags instead of silently ignoring params (the OmniVoice rule: capability flags, not silent fallbacks) — a clone-kind profile bound to a non-cloning provider is a 409 with a typed reason (`cloning_unsupported:<provider>`), never a wrong-voice synthesis.

### 2.2 The cloning engine — one new model-type app

Evaluated engines (both verified in the OmniVoice source as its cloning backends): **k2-fsa OmniVoice** (default diffusion TTS, zero-shot clone from a 3–10s clip, bounded LRU of precomputed clone prompts) and **CosyVoice 3**. Session 2 runs a spike on both against the same fixture set (clip lengths, MPS latency, RAM) and ships ONE as `apps/voice-clone-tts` — the loser's evaluation notes land in the plan dir, not as a second app.

Plug-in fidelity (recon: providers.md "How a NEW provider plugs in" #2):

- App manifest `provider: {type: "model", implementation: "provider:create_provider", capabilities: ["tts"], execution: "sidecar"}` — **sidecar from day one** (LMM-V2 §3): the engine is torch-heavy diffusion, exactly the crash class sidecars exist for. Its venv, resumable install job, child-reported RSS, and generation counters are all LMM-V2 machinery consumed as-is.
- The provider class subclasses `LocalTtsProvider` (so its downloadable engine weights surface through the uniform `list_models/download_model/delete_model` contract and the LMM-V2 multi-layout probe) and declares `supports_cloning = True` (+ `supports_voice_design` if the engine's instruct mode survives the spike).
- `ModelTypeHandler` registration is untouched: duck-typed `is_local_model_provider`, registry keyed by APP name, registered into both `local_models/registry` and `tts/registry`; bundled-population survival across `refresh_providers()` (the two-population invariant) inherited from LMM-V2's regression test.
- Models declared in the app's `catalog.json` with `size_mb`, `runtime: "torch"`, `runtime_contract`, `matrix: {supports_cloning: true, …}`; the LMM-V2 selftest for this provider synthesizes a fixed phrase **through a clone reference fixture** — proving the cloning path specifically, not just model load.
- Piper is untouched and remains the default lightweight engine. `active_models.json` `tts` binding continues to work; profiles reference a provider explicitly so both engines coexist.

### 2.3 What this deliberately does NOT add

- **No new provider TYPE** — `PROVIDER_TYPES` and the `_TypeHandler` set are untouched; voice profiles are an entity + resolver, not a provider family (same stance as "no space provider type", `providers/registry.py:555`).
- **No new action providers** — nothing is added to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (`validation.py:555`). Stated explicitly: TTS-as-a-hook-action ("speak on trigger fire") is a notification-delivery question owned by AMBIENT-SURFACES/AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE, not smuggled in here.
- **No `.ovsvoice`-style signed bundles** — export/import defers to NEW-12's general portable-bundle format (which already absorbed the OmniVoice checklist: schema_version, non-forgeable provenance, zip-slip defense). This plan only guarantees the profile store is *bundle-able* (self-contained dir per profile, no absolute paths in records).

---

## 3. Per-Surface Voice Bindings — explicit > binding > default > built-in

### 3.1 Binding store and precedence

One JSON store, `~/.gideon/voice_bindings.json` (atomic_write), sibling of `active_models.json`:

```json
{ "channel:slack": "vp-a1b2c3d4",
  "channel:webui": "vp-9f8e7d6c",
  "agent:research-agent": "vp-a1b2c3d4",
  "client:claude-desktop": "vp-..." }
```

Resolution — the OmniVoice 4-level precedence chain, verbatim:

1. **explicit** — a `profile_id` passed by the caller (a chat "speak as X" affordance, a future NEW-10 `/v1/audio/speech` `voice` param) always wins;
2. **binding** — the surface key (`channel:<transport-name>` from the channel-transport registry; `agent:<slug>` from config.json `agents{}`; `client:<id>` reserved for NEW-10's inbound API — the key namespace is defined now so the inbound API plugs in without a migration);
3. **default** — the user's default profile (`default` key in the same store);
4. **built-in** — today's behavior exactly: `active_voice_params()`'s flat resolution from the `tts` binding + use-case settings.

### 3.2 Where resolution hooks

`tts/registry.py:active_voice_params()` gains an optional `surface: str = ""` parameter and becomes profile-aware: it walks the precedence chain, loads the winning `VoiceProfile`, and returns the same dict shape **plus** `{profile_id, ref_audio, ref_text, seed, instruct, design_params}` — callers that ignore the new keys keep working (`dashboard/chat_voice.py` passes them into `streaming_voice_reply`, which forwards to `synthesize(**opts)`). No caller is *forced* to know about profiles; level-4 fallback means an empty profiles store reproduces today's behavior bit-for-bit.

Surface identity per caller: `api_voice_synthesize` derives it from the session's origin (webui sessions → `channel:webui`; a Slack-origin session → `channel:slack`); subagent-attributed speech passes `agent:<slug>`. Settings → Voice grows a bindings table (surface rows × profile picker) beside the existing speed/persona fields in `VoicePanel.tsx`.

---

## 4. Duplex-Loop Hardening Pack

All five mechanisms are verified working code in agenticSeek; PClaw's split is that STT capture lives in the **browser** (FE mic → `POST /api/stt/transcribe`) while TTS is server-rendered and FE-played (`voice_chunk` WS events) — so the pack lands as one shared backend module + one FE hook, not a monolithic loop.

New module `voice/duplex.py` (pure functions, unit-testable, no I/O):

### 4.1 Confirmation-phrase execution gating

In continuous-listen mode (the FE's hands-free toggle), transcript chunks **accumulate** without firing a turn until a confirmation phrase matches ("do it", "go ahead", "send it", "execute" — configurable list); exit phrases ("cancel", "never mind") clear the buffer. `is_confirmation(text)` / `is_exit(text)` live in `duplex.py`; the accumulation buffer is FE state (it owns the mic). Push-to-talk and typed input are unaffected — gating applies only to the hands-free path, where a half-finished thought must not become an executed instruction.

### 4.2 TTS-echo filter + STT mute during playback

Two layers, both agenticSeek-proven:

- **Mute (FE):** the voice playback hook exposes start/stop callbacks; while `voice_chunk` audio plays, the FE suspends recognition and drops queued mic buffers (drain + reset on resume). This kills most echo for free.
- **Echo filter (BE, defense-in-depth for speaker bleed):** `is_echo(transcript, last_tts_text) -> bool` — drop any transcript sharing **≥3 consecutive words** with the last TTS output, checked both directions. `api_voice_synthesize` records the last spoken text per session (in-memory, bounded); `api_stt_transcribe` consults it when the request is flagged `duplex: true`. A filtered transcript returns `{text: "", filtered: "echo"}` so the FE shows *why* nothing happened instead of looking deaf.

### 4.3 Pre-TTS text cleaning

`clean_for_speech(text) -> str` in `duplex.py`, applied in `api_voice_synthesize` **after** the existing `redact_exfiltration_urls`/`redact_credentials` calls (the seam already exists at `chat_voice.py:50-51`): strip fenced/inline code, reduce URLs to their domain, reduce file paths to the filename, drop CLI flags, and trim markdown decoration. Applied only on the synthesis path — the chat transcript keeps the full text; only the *audio* is cleaned.

### 4.4 Voice-origin disclaimer

Turns whose input arrived via STT get one appended line — "(Transcribed from voice; transcription may be inaccurate.)" — before entering the chat runner, so the model self-corrects on garbled homophones instead of confidently misreading them. Applied at the transcribe handler's return (the FE includes it when submitting), flagged in the session JSONL metadata as `input_origin: voice` for honest history.

### 4.5 Config

One new `VoiceConfig` section (dataclass beside `DashboardConfig`), wired through the FOUR points (recon gotcha #1): (a) fields with `_meta(label, help)` — `confirmation_phrases: list[str]`, `exit_phrases: list[str]`, `echo_filter_enabled: bool = True`, `duplex_mute_enabled: bool = True`, `clean_for_speech_enabled: bool = True`, `voice_disclaimer_enabled: bool = True`; (b) `AppConfig.load()` explicit mapping; (c) `to_dict()` new top-level section; (d) `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH paths + `VoicePanel.tsx` fields for all six. Guard-class note: the four booleans are convenience features, not safety guards — plain defaults, no fail-safe-parsing ceremony needed (contrast AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS §5).

---

## 5. Screen-Context Observation Channel (NEW-28)

### 5.1 Boundary vs AUTO-R20 — stated once, structurally

Approved **AUTO-R20** (WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE §1.2, `observe` trigger kind, Phase 2, app-delivered) is the *background* half: a capture daemon, idle filter, frame accumulator, batched typed extraction into memory/knowledge/tasks. This section builds ONLY the *live interactive* remainder: the user, in a chat session, presses "Share screen"; the assistant sees what they see for the duration; nothing runs when the session isn't looking. No daemon, no scheduler, no extraction pipeline, no trigger kind — a session-scoped context source. If AUTO-R20 ships later, the two share nothing but the vision use-case; they are deliberately separate machines (a trigger vs a chat affordance).

### 5.2 Capture — FE-owned, indicator-honest

- The composer gains a screen-share toggle (visible only when `dashboard.screen_share_enabled` is on — the opt-in master switch, OFF by default). Toggling on calls `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia` — the **browser's own picker and its native "sharing this screen" indicator** do the consent + visibility work; PClaw adds its own persistent in-app banner (chat header chip, pulsing) for the duration. Explicit stop: the chip, the browser's stop button, or ending the session — all three tear down the stream.
- Frames are sampled client-side: downscale to ≤1568px long edge, JPEG-encode, and capture **on send** (the frame accompanying a user turn) plus an optional "Look again" affordance mid-conversation. No continuous streaming to the backend — personal-scale means the model sees the screen when addressed, not a 30fps firehose.

### 5.3 Injection — a sibling of the attachment seam

- `POST /api/chat/screen-frame {session, frame_b64}` stages the frame in an **in-memory per-session slot** (latest-wins, one frame, never written to disk). The chat runner, at the same point `_inject_attachment_content` (`chat_runner.py:646`) runs, drains the slot and attaches the frame as an image content part on that turn.
- **Model routing:** the frame goes solely to the configured model provider. If the session's bound chat model declares vision (the `image_modality`/VISION capability the bridge already maps, `provider_bridge.py:34`), the image part rides the normal turn. If not, degrade honestly (the platform's machine-readable-degradation idiom): a one-shot `resolve_provider_for_use_case("image_modality")` describe call converts the frame to fenced text — `fence_untrusted(description, source="screen-share")` — injected instead, with the turn annotated `screen_context: described` so the user knows the model read a description, not pixels. No vision-capable binding at all → the toggle renders disabled with the reason ("bind a vision model in Settings → Models").
- **Untrusted-content posture:** a screen frame can contain hostile text (a webpage telling the assistant to exfiltrate). The described-text path is fenced (above); for the native-image path the turn carries a system-side note that on-screen instructions are content, not commands — same doctrine as inbox fencing, applied to the one surface where fencing-by-markup can't wrap pixels.

### 5.4 Ephemerality and pinning

- **Nothing persists by default:** the frame slot is in-memory; frames are not written to uploads, sessions JSONL stores only a `screen_context: true` marker on the turn (never the image bytes); ending share clears the slot.
- **Pin = deliberate promotion:** a "Pin frame" affordance on any screen-context turn writes that frame to the uploads dir through the normal upload store (becoming an ordinary attachment, visible in the file panel, session-scoped). From there, adding it to **knowledge** is the user's ordinary explicit ingest action — pinned screenshots are user items and belong to knowledge.db *only when the user sends them there*; nothing about screen share touches memory.db ever (memory = harness mechanics; a screenshot is not harness mechanics — boundary honored by construction, since the only write path is the uploads store).
- **Restrictions honored:** incognito/temporary sessions (`session_restrictions.py`) disable pinning (writes suppressed is the incognito contract); share itself still works — observation is a read.

### 5.5 Config

`dashboard.screen_share_enabled: bool = False` on the existing `DashboardConfig` — four wiring points as ever: `_meta` on the field, `AppConfig.load()` mapping, `to_dict()` (existing section, so the per-field mapping is the work), `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` path `dashboard.screen_share_enabled` + a toggle in Settings. SEL-audit share start/stop events (trust-relevant, cheap).

---

## 6. Migration & Compatibility

- **Zero-profile behavior is today's behavior:** precedence level 4 (§3.1) delegates to the current flat resolution; no profile, binding, or config write is required after upgrade.
- **Optional one-click migration:** Settings → Voice offers "Create a profile from my current voice" — synthesizing a `design`-kind profile from the active `tts` binding + speed/persona settings and making it the default. Never automatic (a silent migration that renames the user's voice selection is exactly the config-migration surprise class to avoid).
- **`use_case_settings/tts.json` keeps its role** for provider-agnostic behavior (`enabled`, `auto_speak`); `speed`/`speech_voice` remain the built-in-tier values and are shadowed by profile fields when a profile resolves.

---

## 7. Disposition & Dependency Notes

| Item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `TtsProvider` / `LocalTtsProvider` ABCs | **EXTENDED, additive** — capability class attrs + defaulted synthesize kwargs; existing implementations compile unchanged |
| `tts/registry.py:active_voice_params` | **EXTENDED** — optional `surface` param + profile-aware resolution; dict shape is a superset |
| `dashboard/chat_voice.py` | **EXTENDED** — clean_for_speech after the existing redaction calls; last-TTS-text recording; surface derivation |
| `active_models.json` `tts` binding | **KEPT** — built-in precedence tier; profiles reference providers explicitly on top |
| `AgentConfig.voice` (persona text) | **UNTOUCHED** — different axis; naming discipline keeps them apart |
| Cloning engine app | **NEW** `apps/voice-clone-tts` (model type, sidecar) — rides LMM-V2 §3/§2.3/§6 wholesale |
| `CapabilityMatrix` (LMM-V2 §2.1) | **EXTENDED by two fields** — coordinated with the LMM-V2 sessions (land after its Session 1) |
| Portable voice bundles | **DEFERRED to NEW-12** — profile dirs are self-contained so the future exporter needs no schema change here |
| Speak-on-trigger / TTS actions | **DEFERRED** to AMBIENT-SURFACES / AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE delivery contract — no `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` change here |
| Background screen observation | **NOT THIS PLAN** — AUTO-R20 owns it (Phase 2, app-delivered); §5 is the live-session remainder only |
| OpenAI-compat `/v1/audio/*` + per-client-id bindings | **NEW-10's** — §3.1 reserves the `client:` binding namespace so it plugs in cleanly |
| Snapshot/portability coverage | `voice_profiles/` + `voice_bindings.json` join the known-partial-coverage list (persistence recon gotcha #10); noted, not fixed here |

**Sequencing:** Session 1-2 need LMM-V2's `CapabilityMatrix` + sidecar runner on main (its Sessions 1 & 4). §4 and §5 have no LMM-V2 dependency and can land any time — hence Wave 2-3 with early slices pullable forward if LMM-V2 slips.

---

## Implementation Effort

**~5 sessions, Wave 2-3:**

- **Session 1 — entity + resolver:** `VoiceProfile` store (CRUD, path containment, ref-audio upload target), lock-from-history, consent record/verify/revoke with SEL audit; `voice_bindings.json` + 4-level precedence in `active_voice_params(surface=…)`; zero-profile fallback regression test.
- **Session 2 — cloning engine:** OmniVoice-vs-CosyVoice spike on fixtures; ship `apps/voice-clone-tts` as a sidecar model app with `catalog.json`, capability-matrix flags, clone-path selftest; `TtsProvider` flag/kwarg extension; typed `cloning_unsupported` refusal.
- **Session 3 — duplex pack:** `voice/duplex.py` (confirmation/exit matching, `is_echo`, `clean_for_speech`) + unit suite; FE hands-free accumulation + mute-during-playback hook; transcribe-handler echo consult + disclaimer + `input_origin` metadata; `VoiceConfig` through all four wiring points + `VoicePanel.tsx`.
- **Session 4 — screen-context channel:** FE toggle + getDisplayMedia capture + banner chip + frame-on-send; `POST /api/chat/screen-frame` in-memory slot; chat-runner injection beside `_inject_attachment_content` with vision/described routing + fencing; pin-to-uploads; incognito guard; `dashboard.screen_share_enabled` wiring.
- **Session 5 — bindings UI + validation sweep:** Settings → Voice bindings table + profile manager UI (create/clone/design/lock/consent flows); one-click migration affordance; as-a-user validation of the full matrix (profile CRUD × lock × both engines × per-surface bindings × duplex behaviors × screen share on both vision and non-vision models), deep-mutation style per the validation method.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Cloning engine too heavy for typical hardware (diffusion TTS latency/RAM) | Sidecar isolation caps blast radius; piper stays the default; the spike (Session 2) measures MPS latency before committing; profiles degrade to a design-kind rendering on piper if the engine is absent (typed reason, not silence) |
| Voice cloning misuse concerns | Consent-as-provenance with non-forgeable verification; agentic/binding features warn unverified; local-only scope (no sharing surface exists until NEW-12, which requires verification to export) |
| Echo filter false-positives eating real user speech (user quotes the assistant) | 3-consecutive-word threshold (agenticSeek-proven), duplex-flagged requests only, `filtered: "echo"` surfaced in the FE so the drop is visible, config off-switch |
| Confirmation gating feels laggy / user forgets the phrase | Applies only to hands-free mode; buffer contents rendered live in the composer so accumulated text is visible; phrases configurable |
| Screen frames leaking to disk via logs/history | Structural: the only frame container is the in-memory slot + explicit pin path; session JSONL stores a boolean marker; a test asserts no image bytes in session files after a share turn |
| Prompt injection via on-screen content | Described-path fenced via `fence_untrusted(source="screen-share")`; native-image path carries the content-not-commands note; share is observation-only so there is no action surface to hijack directly |
| Non-vision chat model bound → confusing behavior | Honest degradation: described-text substitution annotated `screen_context: described`; toggle disabled with reason when nothing can resolve `image_modality` |
| Profile/binding stores drift from LMM-V2's capability payloads | Flags live in ONE place (`CapabilityMatrix`) and are read, never copied; binding validation re-checks the flag at synthesis time, not only at bind time |
| Name confusion with `AgentConfig.voice` persona field | Naming discipline (§ Overview) + a docstring cross-reference on both; no bare `voice` config key added |

## Success Criteria

1. Create a clone-kind profile from a 5s reference clip, synthesize through the cloning engine, hit "lock" on a liked generation from history — subsequent syntheses are seed-pinned and audibly consistent; unlock restores variation.
2. A clone profile of someone else's voice binds to a subagent only past a consent warning; recording consent (real audio + text) flips `verified_own_voice` — and hand-editing the JSON flag alone does NOT (recomputed from artifacts).
3. Bind profile A to `channel:webui` and profile B to `agent:research-agent`; an explicit `profile_id` on a synthesize call beats both; deleting all profiles reproduces today's flat piper behavior exactly (level-4 fallback, regression-tested).
4. Kill the cloning sidecar mid-synthesis: the gateway survives, the caller gets the typed sidecar-crash reason, piper-bound surfaces are unaffected (LMM-V2 isolation inherited, proven on this engine).
5. In hands-free mode, dictating a request does nothing until "go ahead"; the assistant's own spoken reply never re-enters as input (mute + echo filter, verified with speaker audio); a code-and-URL-heavy answer is spoken without reading a URL aloud while the transcript shows full text.
6. A voice-originated turn carries the disclaimer + `input_origin: voice` metadata; a homophone-garbled transcription visibly self-corrects.
7. With screen share active: the browser indicator AND the in-app chip both show; a sent message answers a question about what's on screen (vision model) or about its fenced description (non-vision model, annotated); stopping share + inspecting `~/.gideon` finds zero frame bytes anywhere.
8. Pinning a frame produces an ordinary uploads attachment; an incognito session refuses the pin; nothing from either surface ever appears in `memory.db`, and knowledge ingestion of a pinned frame happens only via the user's explicit action.
9. All new config fields round-trip through load/save/PATCH (four-wiring-points verified by the schema reachability tests) and every toggle changes live behavior as-a-user.
10. `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS`, `PROVIDER_TYPES`, and the type-handler set are byte-identical before and after this plan lands (no accidental provider-family creep — asserted in review).

## Execution log

### `MI-4` — Screen-context observation channel — DONE (2026-08-16)

Shipped §5 in full: `dashboard/screen_context.py` (the in-memory latest-wins slot +
the delivery-routing policy), `GET/POST /api/chat/screen-frame`,
`POST /api/chat/screen-frame/pin`, the drain-and-deliver step in `chat_runner.py`, a
`stage_image_part` seam on `ModelProvider` implemented by the OpenAI and Anthropic
adapters and delegated by `NativeAgentRuntime`, and the FE trio
(`useScreenShare` + the composer control + the header `ScreenShareChip`) behind
`dashboard.screen_share_enabled`, **off by default**.

Four things worth recording because they changed the design:

1. **The interactive chat path is text-only.** `chat_runner` calls
   `client.stream(str)`; there was no channel for an image content part anywhere in
   the chat path, and the one existing vision call site
   (`knowledge/pipeline/nodes/_llm.py`) emits an OpenAI-shaped `image_url` block that
   `AnthropicProvider._translate_messages` passes through **unchanged** — i.e. it
   would 400 against the Messages API. So the seam had to be per-adapter:
   `stage_image_part` stages, and each adapter renders its OWN wire shape
   (`image_url` vs `{"type":"image","source":{...}}`) as the request is built. Base
   returns `False`, and that default is the safety property — an ACP CLI reports "I
   cannot carry an image" and the frame degrades to a description instead of being
   silently dropped.

2. **DEVIATION — the drain runs just before `client.stream(...)`, not beside
   `_inject_attachment_content`.** §5.3 named the attachment-injection point, but the
   routing decision needs the live `client` (does this transport carry an image?) and
   the resolved model id (does this model read images?), neither of which exists at
   that point in `_run_chat`. Same turn, same one-shot contract, ~650 lines later.

3. **Two independent conditions, not one.** The model's declared vision capability
   (`infer_capabilities(model_id)` — the same per-model source Settings → Models
   uses) and the transport's `stage_image_part` verdict are different questions, and
   BOTH must say yes before pixels are sent. `"auto"`/unknown resolves to *not*
   vision, so an unconfirmed model gets a description rather than an image it may
   ignore.

4. **Per-turn pinning is not buildable, and that is the feature.** §5.4 asks for a
   pin affordance "on any screen-context turn". The client cannot pin an older frame
   without retaining every frame — exactly the retention this section forbids — and
   the server destroyed its copy at drain. So the affordance pins the frame currently
   being shared (composer "+" → **Pin shared frame**), and older turns have none.

**Falsification.** Eleven mutations, ten reddened. The eleventh exposed a **test
defect**: the leak search looked for the marker raw and as `b64(marker)`, neither of
which is a substring of `b64(whole_png)` — so a leak stored in the base64 form the
frame actually ARRIVES in was invisible. Adding that third needle turned both the
SEL-record mutation and a new disk-leak mutation red, and the disk test now carries a
vacuity floor that plants each form and requires the search to find it.

**Unverifiable half, stated plainly.** Criterion 7 wants the browser indicator AND the
chip both showing. Only the chip is assertable in jsdom: the browser's capture
indicator is user-agent chrome with no DOM presence, and jsdom implements neither
`getDisplayMedia` nor any capture UI. What is asserted instead is the property that
keeps the pair honest — the chip is mounted off the LIVE track and torn down on its
`ended` event, so the browser's own stop button clears it. The two-indicator claim
itself needs a real browser, and that drive is `MI-5`'s scope (its criteria already
name "screen share on vision and non-vision models"); no one has run it yet.

### `MI-4` completion pass — reviewing the implementation session's own diff

Fourteen further mutations, all fourteen reddened, plus one that had to STAY green and
did. Two of them exposed honesty defects in the tests rather than in the code, both the
same shape — a guarantee the surrounding prose claimed and the code did not deliver:

1. **The no-disk assertion scanned prose as code.** `test_module_holds_no_file_write_path`
   said it stripped "the docstrings/comments" and stripped only `#` lines. Putting
   `open(` into the module docstring as pure prose reddened it — so documenting the
   guarantee would have broken the test asserting it, while a write path hidden behind
   an aliased import would still have slipped through. Re-asserted over the AST (calls
   plus imports): prose is invisible to it, and the import check is strictly stronger
   than the substring scan it replaces.
2. **A test that asserted neither half of its own name.**
   `test_no_leftover_bytes_module_import_is_side_effect_free` carried
   `assert io is not None` — a vacuous assertion whose only job was to keep an unused
   import past flake8 — and an emptiness check the autouse fixture already guaranteed.
   Giving the module a genuine import-time side effect left it green, which is the
   proof. Replaced with a subprocess import under a fresh home asserting both an empty
   registry and an empty home.

**One real code defect, found by review not by a red test.** `model_reads_images`
partitioned the model label on its first colon and kept the tail. `provider:model` and
a bare `model:tag` are syntactically identical, so `llava:latest` became `latest` —
and `qwen2-vl:7b` and `llama3.2-vision:11b` likewise — reducing three genuine vision
models to meaningless tags and routing them to the describe path. Both readings are now
tried; because capability inference is substring-based, consulting the whole label can
only add a match, never lose one. The regression test asserts the premise first
(`infer_capabilities` does recognise those ids), so it cannot pass vacuously.

**Documented, not fixed** (it is not fixable at this seam): the state route and the
runner share `resolve_delivery` but cannot share its input. The runner resolves
`auto`/empty against the live provider; the route runs before a provider exists and can
only pass `session.model` as stored. On an `auto` session the route may therefore
report DESCRIBED or NONE where the runner will go NATIVE. The divergence is
one-directional and in the safe direction — the UI can only under-promise, never
promise pixels that do not arrive — and `useScreenShare` deliberately does not surface
the mode to the user. Recorded in `screen_context.py` beside the policy.

`dashboard.screen_share_enabled` was also added to `docs/reference/configuration.md`,
which the implementation session missed. (Seven other `dashboard.*` fields are missing
from that table on `main`; those are pre-existing and left alone.)
