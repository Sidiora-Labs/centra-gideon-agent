## Overview

Every background behavior in Gideon becomes one sentence: **a Trigger fires — or resumes — a WorkflowRun of a WorkflowDef.** Trigger = *when*. WorkflowDef = *what* (graph of v2 nodes; degenerate case = one action node). WorkflowRun = *what happened* (journaled, per-step, resumable). "Resumes" is new (AUTO-R11): a fire may resolve a wait/gate node in an *existing* run instead of starting a new one.

Today the codebase has ~6 trigger stores (`crons.json`, `hooks.json`, `event_triggers.json`, autonudge state, HEARTBEAT.md, inbox alert-keywords), ~5 match-then-act engines (hook matcher, event-trigger patterns, inbox keyword matcher, fs-watch, heartbeat parser), and ~5 separately-built unattended-LLM pipelines (cron agent turns, heartbeat BACKGROUND_KEY turns, autonudge injection, event-trigger spawns, hook spawns). These are the same concept wearing different clothes.

**Soul guardrail:** this is a *personal* substrate — one user, one gateway, plain files under `~/.gideon`. The n8n idea we steal is the *shape* (trigger → graph → run history), not the enterprise machinery. No queues-as-a-service, no RBAC, no visual canvas as primary authoring. Proactive behaviors propose; they never silently write.

### Starting points (verified against code, 2026-07-12 recon)

The design below builds on what actually exists — not on the idealized versions earlier drafts assumed:

- **There is no timer heap.** `ScheduleService` runs a *single re-armed asyncio task* (`_arm_timer`, schedule.py L1070) sleeping `min(next-due-delay, 30s)`, with cron-expr dueness decided by `croniter.match` on the current minute (`_is_due` L1215) plus a same-UTC-minute refire guard. The TriggerService generalizes *this* mechanism (§3.1) — it does not "extend a heap."
- **Jitter is deterministic per job id** (BLAKE2b of id → fraction of window, L1156-1213), not random and not configurable; `strict_schedule=True` is the only opt-out. New stagger behaviors (boot catch-up, restart spread) reuse the same deterministic-hash pattern.
- **The execution model is already unified.** `ScheduleJob`'s what-runs is ONE canonical `action {provider, config}` (L145); legacy fields (`message`/`script`/`command`/…) are read-only `@property` projections (L152-208). The migration is a *store/entity* unification, not an execution-model rewrite.
- **A unified triggers facade already exists.** `dashboard/handlers/triggers.py` serves `/api/triggers` over the three stores with namespaced ids `schedule:<id>` / `lifecycle:<id>` / `event:<id>`. Store unification (§7 step 2) starts from *that* facade — the API shape survives, the backing stores merge.
- **Only 7 of the 15 `HOOK_EVENTS` actually fire today**: SessionStart, AgentSpawn, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, Error (chat_runner.py L1441-2558 + `fire_tool_hooks`). PreResponse, PostResponse, MemoryWrite, ContextCompact, SubagentSpawn, TaskComplete, ApprovalRequest, SessionEnd have **no fire sites**. Chat-turn hooks fire *agent-scoped* (`fire_for_ids` via `AgentProfile.triggers`) — there is no global firing path from chat turns. Wiring the missing 8 is a deliverable (§7 step 1), not an assumption.
- **`event_triggers.py` fires only on memory writes** (`vector_memory._log_event` → `emit_memory_event` is the sole emitter), and a sync-context fire (CLI write, no running loop) records `fire_count` but **skips the action** (L209) — the spool fix in §3.3 addresses a real, verified hole.
- **Autonudge is reactive, not periodic**: `notify_turn_complete` re-arms the idle timer per turn; only *delivered* nudges count toward `max_cycles`; a mid-turn session drops the nudge (no queueing, deliberate). That drop IS `overlap: skip` semantics — the substrate names and generalizes it.
- **Heartbeat is a hard-coded 60s loop** with tick-modulo sub-tasks (FTS rebuild every 15 ticks, daily prunes at 1440) — the interval is not config-exposed; changing it would silently shift the modulo cadences. Conversion (§7 step 5) makes each sub-task an explicit clock trigger instead.
- **Autopause-after-5 already exists for the cron action path** (gateway `_maybe_autopause` in `_run_action_job`). The substrate *generalizes* it to all kinds — it does not invent it.
- **Autonudge counts only delivered fires; inbox alerts evaluate once at ingestion; app crons are force-silent and reconciled at startup** — all preserved semantics, called out in §2.

## 1. The Trigger Entity

One store: `~/.gideon/triggers.json` (fcntl + atomic write, absorbing crons.json / hooks.json / event_triggers.json / autonudge config). Parsed with **never-throw structural validation** (AUTO-R15): typed issue records + closest-match resolution rendered as WARNING chips — an agent-authored near-miss must never become a silently-dead trigger.

### 1.1 Dataclass

```python
@dataclass
class Trigger:
    id: str                   # deterministic where minted by a feature (e.g. "system:heartbeat:fts") so re-registration is idempotent (R1)
    name: str                 # unique per concern — creation refuses duplicates, surfaces the existing trigger (R15)
    enabled: bool
    created_by: str           # user | app:<name> | agent | workflow | system:<feature>
    kind: str                 # clock | event | idle | file | webhook | view | web_watch | manual  (+ Phase 2: pulse, observe)
    spec: dict                # per-kind (below); may include composite gates (R17)
    gates: dict               # {debounce_secs?, rate_cap?, max_fires?, skip_dates?, quiet_hours?,
                              #  cost_cap?, max_cost_usd_per_run?, max_actions_per_hour?,        (R5)
                              #  cooldown_secs?, idempotency: bool?, threshold: int?,            (R12)
                              #  condition?: {checkType, compareMode, …},                        (R12)
                              #  max_runs_per_hour?}                                             (R8; manual fires bypass)
    capabilities: dict        # frozen at save (R3): {allowed_actions: [provider names],
                              #  allowed_write_scopes: {paths: [], entity_kinds: []}, network: bool}
    workflow: dict            # {ref: <def name>} | {inline: <single-action spec>} | {resume: {run_id, node_id}}  (R11)
    overlap: str              # skip | queue | parallel — default skip (R2); fire-time claim lock
    session: str              # fresh | pinned:<key> | conversation:<chat session key>
    model_tier: str           # background | standard — resolved ONCE via config (R5)
    delivery: str             # none | notify | channel:<target> | inbox   (contract in decision 13)
    failure_delivery: str     # separate route for failures — failures reach the inbox even when delivery:none (R12)
    retry: dict               # {attempts, backoff: [secs, …]} per typed exit (R12/R7)
    failure_policy: dict      # {autopause_after: 5, dedupe_hash: true} — per-EXIT-TYPE (R7): only true failures count
    yield_to_user: bool       # background fire waits for a quiet window (R9)
    resource_slots: list      # named slots this trigger's runs claim, e.g. ["local-llm"] (R9)
    catch_up: bool            # fire ONCE at boot/wake if the last slot was missed (R8); default false
    expires_at: str           # default auto-expiry on user-created recurring triggers, deliberate renewal (R12)
    # --- runtime / rollup fields (written by the service, never by forms) ---
    next_fire_at: str         # persisted BEFORE execution (R1)
    last_run_id: str
    run_count: int
    last_success_at: str      # health rollups (R7) — lists render status dots without scanning runs
    last_failure_at: str
    health_status: str        # ok | degraded | parked | failing
    last_error_summary: str
    state: str                # active | paused | autopaused | parked | quarantined | retired
```

`spawned_by` lineage and `provenance_chain` ride the *fire/run records*, not the trigger row (decision 5).

### 1.2 Per-Kind Specs

| Kind | Spec | Source Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `clock` | tagged union `{kind:'cron', expr}` \| `{kind:'at', at, delete_after_run: true}` \| `{kind:'sequence', at: [datetimes]}` (R12); tz (IANA), deterministic jitter (kept verbatim from schedule.py), `strict`, `skip_dates` | Everything `schedule.py` has today. `at` one-shots default `delete_after_run: true` + a create-grace-window rule so auto-deleted one-shots vanish instead of resurrecting — what §7 step 5's commitment one-shots need. NL authoring via existing `nl_to_cron`. Min-interval floor: 15 min default for LLM-invoking clock triggers, overridable (R1) |
| `event` | `{source, pattern: {glob?, regex?, keywords?}}` | ONE event bus + ONE matcher grammar unifying three vocabularies: the agent-lifecycle `HOOK_EVENTS` (**7 fire today — SessionStart, AgentSpawn, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, Error; the other 8 get fire sites wired in §7 step 1**), data events (MemoryUpdate/MemoryKeyPattern/ContentMatch — today emitted only by memory writes), and new sources the code already produces but nobody consumes: `FileChanged` (fs_watch), `InboxItemIngested` (inbox). Completeness rule (R6): every entity CRUD in the gateway emits a typed event on the one bus. **Taxonomy discipline (R12): one trigger = one narrow event** — narrowness is what keeps storm guards simple. Payload content NEVER participates in pattern matching (decision 4e) |
| `run_completed` | `{source_trigger \| source_def}` | Chain kind (R12): fires when a named trigger/def's run completes, payload `{chainSource, previousResult}` with `previousResult` delivered FENCED; composes with the `spawned_by` recursion guard (decision 5) so chains can't cycle |
| `idle` | `{scope: session:<key> \| gateway, idle_secs, first_idle_secs}` | Autonudge's predicate, generalized. **Recon note:** autonudge is *reactive* — re-armed by `notify_turn_complete`, cancelled by user input, delivered-only counting; those semantics carry over verbatim |
| `file` | `{paths: [globs], dedup: (path, content_hash)}` | Sugar over `event/FileChanged`. Content-hash dedup keyed on (path, content_hash), not path-only (R12); fires carry the **changed-file delta payload** so fired workflows foreach only over new items. Ships a `vcs` preset (watch `.git/refs/heads/*`) for on-commit automations |
| `webhook` | `{token_ref}` → `POST /api/triggers/{id}/fire` | Per-trigger bearer token stored in the secrets store as `{{secret:…}}`, SHA-256-hashed at rest, never verbatim in triggers.json (R14). Optional freeform text payload — fenced + screened (decision 4) |
| `view` | `{surface_binding, ttl_secs}` | Pull-on-view (R10): fires when a bound surface (dashboard tile, artifact open) renders past TTL; within TTL serve cache. Refreshes are ledger-only rows carrying per-refresh token cost; per-trigger rate caps; the runs inbox shows a freshness column. Sidesteps the 1440-run-dirs critique by never firing unviewed |
| `web_watch` | `{url, poll_interval, extraction: auto\|selectors, novelty_key}` | Fires ONLY when new items appear (guid/novelty-keyed seen-set — the seen-set IS the storm guard). Per-connection cursor + dedup set + daily request budget. Fetching goes through the **`net.fetch` egress chokepoint** with escalating-fetch-with-budget (plain fetch → optional headless tier, one `max_requests` budget per firing, escalations ledger-logged). Digest output lands in the **knowledge store** (user items), never in memory |
| `manual` | — | Run-now / replay / dry-run (T9 observe-mode kept; recon: dry-run against bash/run-script/webhook is *refused and recorded as a preview* — only run-prompt/run-workflow truly dry-run). Manual fires bypass min-interval + `max_runs_per_hour` but never `max_requests_per_sec`-class floors (R6d) |
| `pulse` *(Phase 2)* | `{watch: [memory-delta classes], confidence_floor}` | Proactive kind (R19): watches **memory/context deltas** (episodic entries, task/calendar signals — explicitly NOT raw screen frames; this is MEMORY, the harness's own mechanics — see decision 14) and generates a BOUNDED queue of proposed matters with confidence scores, surfaced as needs-input proposals, never silently executed. Accept/decline feedback drives escalating per-matter-class suppression cooldowns; only repeatedly-accepted low-risk classes may graduate to auto-execute. Standing delegations = ONE visible delegation object bundling a recurring trigger + the R5 triage gate + learned filters |
| `observe` *(Phase 2, opt-in, app-delivered)* | `{interval, exclusions: [app/window], batch_n}` | Screen-observation ingestion (R20): capture daemon → idle filter (discard unchanged frames) → accumulator (batch N frames = one fire, never per-frame — the accumulator IS the storm guard) → typed multi-modal extraction into memory/knowledge/tasks. Privacy structural: the capture toggle renders as a visible edit-locked `created_by: system` row; all processing local; media compression in a subprocess (GIL avoidance). Ships as an **app-delivered provider**, not core (§ Plug-in Map) |

**Composite trigger shape (R17):** any event/clock trigger may declare a conjunction — event wake source + time-window gate + input-hash idempotence — evaluated at fire time ("on session_end, if hour≥22 and content_hash ≠ last_processed, fire once"). The time-window and hash checks are free gates; only the event is the wake source. Replaces the two-triggers-plus-manual-dedup workaround for "end-of-day compilation" patterns.

**Condition gates (R12):** an optional LLM-free `condition` on clock/event triggers, evaluated at fire time — matrix: `checkType` http/command/file/agent × `compareMode` hash/status/jsonpath/regex, with persisted `last_state` + consecutive-unchanged counter; agent-evaluated conditions are an explicit expensive tier. Plus declarative preconditions (artifact path + dotted field + required value) classifying FRESH / ALREADY_DONE / PARTIAL_DRIFT / UNEXPECTED_DRIFT before mutating. A field, not new kinds.

### 1.3 Fire & Run Records — two weights, typed outcomes (R2)

Trigger history vs run state are separate concerns. Two record weights:

- **Full run** (dir + journal): any workflow with ≥2 nodes, any LLM stage, anything resumable.
- **Ledger-only fire** (row in runs.db + one events.jsonl line per trigger): single-action fires. Carries `ScheduleRun`'s honest semantics (`launched≠succeeded`, trace, per-trigger caps of 100 — the existing `schedule_history.py` shape) without the directory tax. ~30d TTL/GC.

**The materiality predicate is the classification criterion (R2):** did the run mutate durable state? Derived from the tool-call journal — did any call touch the world (send/post/create/write) vs merely produce text (tryfriday's action|response|error derivation; no new instrumentation beyond the journal). No-op runs collapse to ledger-only and auto-archive out of the default inbox view. Productive rows carry a diff-style "written/learned" section (artifacts/memories/proposals created) + extracted external artifact permalinks, so "what did my machine do while I slept" rows deep-link to the thing produced. An emdash-style **convert-to-full** affordance promotes a ledger row to a full run/work container retroactively.

**Every suppressed or degenerate fire becomes a ledger row with a typed outcome + one-line reason** — silent drops are banned:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `skipped_overlap` | overlap:skip claim lock held (a run in flight) |
| `skipped_budget` | cost/action cap breached pre-claim (R5) |
| `skipped_gate` | quiet-hours / debounce / cooldown / condition-false |
| `skipped_noop` | ran, mutated nothing durable |
| `skipped_triage` | triage stage said ignore — WITH rationale (R5) |
| `skipped_missed` | user dismissed a missed-fire card (R8) |
| `deferred` | parked/yielded/resource-busy — escalating backoff, ONE row per episode, not per attempt |
| `ran_late` | executed with `scheduled_for` recorded alongside `started_at` |
| `refused` | policy refusal — distinct from failed/skipped, mandatory human-readable reason posted back to the triggering surface (R2) |
| `blocked_injection` | pre-LLM screen match (decision 4a) — names the matched pattern, NEVER auto-retried |

Ledger rows pre-allocate outcome-feedback fields (`acted_on`/`dismissed`) for the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL plan, carry duration + counters + an `incomplete: true` flag where counting was cut short ("at least N"), and a severity→policy mapping (severity maps to run weight, response deadline, decision authority). **Tracked-mutation contract:** background jobs mutate only through event-emitting wrappers so projections never drift.

### 1.4 Design Decisions (from adversarial review + research integration)

1. **Gates are trigger-level config, not graph nodes.** Debounce/rate-cap/max_fires/skip_dates/quiet_hours/budget/cooldown/condition answer "should this fire at all" and belong on the Trigger (a person edits them in one form). Conditions-inside-work, retry-until-done, and approval gates answer "what happens inside the run" and belong in the graph. Degenerate automations (99% of personal use) stay a two-field form. **Fail-open vs fail-closed is classified per gate (R3 am.):** budget/storm-guard checks time-box and fail-open; security fences (capabilities, injection screen, fencing) stay fail-closed.

2. **Blocking `PreToolUse` hooks stay synchronous.** A blocking decision must return inside the agent loop — it cannot be an async WorkflowRun. Kept as `kind: event, spec.blocking: true`, executed inline through the action registry exactly as today, journaled as a zero-step ledger record after the fact. `HookManager`'s declarative allow/deny rules are a **policy layer**, not automation — untouched. **Recon note:** chat-turn hooks fire agent-scoped (`fire_for_ids` over `AgentProfile.triggers`); the substrate preserves agent scoping as an optional `spec.agent_scope` and does not silently introduce a global chat firing path.

3. **Two record weights + typed outcomes** — see §1.3. This replaces rev-1's bare "ledger-only fire" with the full outcome vocabulary; the flagship surface stays honest because nothing is dropped silently.

4. **Untrusted-input fencing at the substrate boundary — hardened (R4).** Webhook text payloads, `InboxItemIngested` content, `ContentMatch`-captured values, and `run_completed.previousResult` cross the trust boundary into unattended LLM execution. Six rules, enforced at trigger-fire time (extending `security.fence_untrusted`, whose only call sites today are inbox_service ×2, knowledge/insights, skills/proposals + one inline fence in after_turn_review — the substrate becomes call site #5, centralized):
   - (a) an **InputGuard-style regex screen** (OWASP 6 groups: override, token smuggling, persona hijack, jailbreak, prompt leaking, indirect injection) runs BEFORE fencing+LLM at the webhook/file/inbox boundary (~0.2ms, zero tokens); blocked payloads → `blocked_injection` ledger row naming the pattern, never auto-retried (no-retry prevents trigger loops brute-forcing the guard);
   - (b) fencing **strips chat-template special/role tokens** so untrusted text can't forge role boundaries — essential with local model providers;
   - (c) the fence tag carries **provenance attributes** (`source_type, source_id, transformation_path` — extending the existing `source=` kwarg); trust promotion is an explicit recorded operation;
   - (d) **payload content never participates in event-pattern/template matching** — only trigger spec patterns match; payload is data;
   - (e) payloads becoming structured workflow input are parsed via **schema-constrained extraction** (jsonschema, `additionalProperties: false`, length caps) at the boundary; cross-run/workflow-minted trigger events are typed bus events gated by a per-source target-template allowlist, never parsed from run prose (the forged-handoff attack);
   - (f) pre-fetch URL classification blocks private-IP/loopback targets from untrusted payloads — already what `net/guard.py:classify_host` does; the substrate routes ALL payload-derived fetches through `net.fetch` (ssrf category).
   - Extension target (cross-ref security roadmap): app/MCP-delivered tool and skill DESCRIPTIONS are also untrusted prompt text.

5. **Feedback-loop storm guard — two lineage fields (R17).** `created_by: workflow` triggers + the event bus make cycles trivial (run writes memory → MemoryUpdate → run…). Layers: (a) the global event rate cap (30 fires/60s — today a module constant in event_triggers.py, promoted to config §Plug-in Map) carries over; (b) a fire carries a transient `provenance_chain` (trigger ids seen this cascade); a chain revisiting the same trigger id is dropped + surfaced as a warning; (c) every trigger-fired run carries persistent **`spawned_by` lineage**, and lifecycle triggers (`run_completed`, MemoryWrite) default to skipping runs their own workflow spawned — catching *indirect* self-improvement loops the direct-cycle check misses. Both fields are needed: provenance_chain is the cascade check, spawned_by the durable lineage; (d) `created_by: workflow|agent` triggers are announced to the user on creation and capped (default 20 active) — visible, not silent; workflow-minted `resume` triggers auto-retire when their target run completes (no orphan watchers).

6. **Dual-writer ownership rule.** Where a settings UI writes triggers (inbox alert-keywords) the rows carry `created_by: system:<feature>` and the Automations page renders them edit-locked with a "managed by Inbox settings" chip — one writer per row, ever.

7. **Creation-time capability allowlist (R3).** Every non-manual trigger carries a `capabilities` block frozen at save time — `{allowed_actions, allowed_write_scopes: {paths, entity_kinds}, network}` — enforced by the engine at execution. **Auto-fired triggers (clock/event/file/webhook/view/web_watch) default to read-only action providers**; write-capable actions require explicit opt-in rendered as a badge on the Automations row. Untrusted payloads may only BIND ARGUMENTS to the pre-declared action set, never introduce actions (frozen action-set invariant); every run stamps a trust-origin chain (trigger kind → workflow → payload source). Sensitive workflow classes (learning/consolidation/**memory-write** — harness internals per decision 14) are launchable only by clock/manual triggers, never webhook/event-origin. Violations fail fast as a typed ledger record. Mechanics (R3 am.5): at run construction the GLOBAL tool/MCP config is *filtered down* to the trigger's declared list (missing servers degrade with a logged warning — availability and policy are separate concerns); subagents spawned inside trigger-fired runs default to a read-only research class gated by tool-name pattern. Enforcement plumbing: provider-registration invariant (every action provider declares its enforcement chokepoint, with a test asserting no execution without a policy check); 4-tier policy vocabulary (silent / first-prompt+allowlist / always-prompt / hard-block) with `bypass_immune` safety checks no allowlist may silence — this layers onto the existing `HookManager` sensitive-path-first ordering and `security.py` deny patterns; PathGuard (realpath + symlink-target matching) for fs-touching providers; runtime per-action enforcement (payload trust × tool sensitivity at each sensitive action, not just fire-time); optional LLM permission classifier as an intermediate mode (forced structured tool call, fail-closed); and a **global manual kill switch** pausing all background execution. The policy layer also owns the outbound mirror: machine-generated disclaimer prepended to externally-posted content from trigger-fired runs.

8. **Missed fires are reviewed, not silently skipped and not blindly replayed (R8).** Explicitly rejected: full auto-catch-up (restart storm) and silent skip (a lie). The middle path is §3.4's review card + the per-trigger `catch_up` flag.

9. **No circuit breakers (R7).** Capability failure ≠ core failure. Unhealthy-provider fires are PARKED with a simple per-target cooldown + `suppressed_total/executed_total` counters + `retry_after_ms` + a `deferred` ledger row — explicitly NOT a 3-state breaker (gideon deleted theirs because a 10-min lockout silently dropped legitimate work). Pause only affected triggers. After N similar failures, quarantine the trigger's runs with captured evidence + explicit replay (dead-letter richer than bare autopause).

10. **Hook doctrine — IO-only lifecycle budget (R17).** Lifecycle handlers (event subscribers that are NOT triggers) get an IO-only sub-second budget; anything needing an LLM call or multi-step logic MUST spawn a WorkflowRun through the normal fire path. This keeps the bus fast and makes it impossible for a slow handler to block dispatch. Scale evidence (Memoh's 38 hook points): a fine-grained event vocabulary is only usable *because* handlers are cheap — the vocabulary can grow (pre/post model call, memory-formation-completed, tool-approval requested/resolved, subagent start/stop) without freezing the agent loop. **Recon caution carried over:** today every `ScriptHookStore._fire` rewrites the whole store to persist run stats — the unified store batches stat writes so a high-frequency PreToolUse hook doesn't imply a JSON rewrite per tool call.

11. **Unattended permission posture = a named `headless` profile (R16).** Trigger-fired runs convert every permission-ask to deny (tool safety checks stay live; the run never parks on a prompt), with denied decisions recorded alongside a suggested allowlist rule for user review. Packaged as ONE named profile object (distinct from interactive defaults, resolved by construction for every trigger-fired run) so the user inspects the entire unattended permission surface in one place — belt-and-suspenders with the capability allowlist (decision 7). Per-app grants cover external clients hitting the webhook kind. This formalizes what the cron path does today (`ToolApprovalPolicy.AUTO_APPROVE`/`HOOK_BASED`, never interactive — gateway `_cron_callback`).

12. **`{{secret:KEY}}` server-side secret templating (R14).** Trigger specs, inline action params, and workflow-def params may reference `{{secret:KEY}}`; resolution happens server-side at execution time only, backed by the existing credential store (`config/loader.py:save_credential` → `.env`, 0600). API/UI expose key NAMES only (presence flags, never values); every journal/ledger/transcript record stores the template string, never the resolved value (redact-before-journal sink, composing with `security.redact()`). Webhook bearer tokens live here (SHA-256-hashed at rest), with scoped tokens (owner/collaborator/viewer) for webhook/manual auth rather than one shared secret.

13. **Outbound delivery contract (R18).** The `delivery` field stops being an unspecified enum. On run completion the substrate emits `automation.run.succeeded|failed` events carrying: a **stable event-id preserved across retries** (the idempotency key — channel consumers dedupe re-delivered notifications); an event-type header; a **statusUrl deep link** into the exact runs-inbox row / run journal (fixing the notification→journal dead end); and **destination-aware formatting** — rich block for inbox/notify, flattened text for `channel:slack` (directly relevant to the existing Slack transport). Delivery routes through the existing gate: `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()` (providers/entity_routes.py) — the substrate does not build a second notification path. Redaction (`redact_exfiltration_urls` + `redact_credentials`) before any surface, as heartbeat delivery does today.

14. **Memory vs Knowledge boundary (user directive).** KNOWLEDGE = the user's personal items (documents, files, photos, notes; future knowledge providers: Google Drive, Google Photos, …). MEMORY = the harness's own internal mechanics (facts/facets/episodic/procedural/lessons). The substrate touches both and must never conflate them: `web_watch`/`file` digests write to the **knowledge store**; `pulse` watches **memory** deltas; MemoryWrite-class triggers and memory-writing workflow classes are gated per decision 7; learning-outcome feedback fields on ledger rows feed the LEARNING-FLYWHEEL plan (memory side), not knowledge.

## 2. Disposition Table

| Surface | Verdict | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule.py` machinery | **ABSORBED** (rename, not rewrite) | Becomes TriggerService clock kind. crons.json migrates row-for-row. **What is actually kept verbatim (per recon): the single re-armed asyncio timer task (≤30s poll) + croniter minute-match dueness + same-minute refire guard, deterministic per-id jitter, tz + `skip_dates`, mtime `_sync`, fcntl `.crons.lock`, per-job timeout + the reaper (SIGKILL escalation, PID-recycle checks), `_merge_job_result` runtime-field merge-back, and the canonical `action {provider, config}` execution model** (legacy fields are already projections — no exec-model migration needed). `schedule_script.py` sandbox + Skip/Done/Report contract kept as the `run-script` provider. §3.1's crash discipline is layered ON this mechanism |
| `schedule_history.py` ScheduleRun | **ABSORBED** | Its record shape (honest `launched≠succeeded`, dry-run replay, JSONL caps 100/job + index) becomes the ledger-only fire record, extended with the §1.3 typed-outcome vocabulary; full runs use the v2 run layout. `last_run_status()` semantics (UI badge reads history, not the volatile job field) carry over to health rollups |
| `hooks.py` ScriptHooks | **ABSORBED** | → `Trigger{kind:event, source:agent}`. Blocking PreToolUse = the synchronous special case. hooks.json migrated; matcher → unified grammar; agent-scoping preserved (decision 2). `__hook_depth` (invoke-agent refuses at ≥3) folds into the `__wf_depth` cap. **Only 7 of 15 events fire today — wiring the missing 8 fire sites is part of §7 step 1**, following the existing convention (constant + `HOOK_EVENTS` + `LIFECYCLE_EVENT_CATALOG` row + fire site, co-located so catalog and payload can't drift) |
| `hooks.py` HookManager (declarative rules) | **KEPT** (policy layer) | Not an automation. Stays in config.json; gains the decision-7 enforcement vocabulary on top |
| `event_triggers.py` | **ABSORBED** | Its own docstring asks for this. max_fires/debounce/rate-cap → trigger gates. Fixes the facade unevenness (event kind gains toggle/update/run/test/history) and the **verified sync-CLI silent-skip** (a fire with no running loop records fire_count but skips the action — fires now spool per §3.3). Its only emitter today is memory writes (`vector_memory._log_event`); the bus adds the missing sources |
| `autonudge.py` | **ABSORBED as `kind:idle`** — LAST | An autonudge = `Trigger{kind:idle, session:conversation}` + a run-prompt def. **Blocked on LOOPS-EVOLUTION Phase 4** (the loop engine rides autonudge as its tick engine — `loop-<id>` worker sessions armed via `svc.add`). `kind:idle` ships for USER automations early; the loop-ticker use waits. Preserved semantics: reactive re-arm, delivered-only cycle counting, mid-turn drop (= `overlap: skip`), stop-sentinel, error_count deactivation |
| `heartbeat.py` tasks | **ABSORBED**; HEARTBEAT.md kept as sugar | Each HEARTBEAT.md line = a clock trigger + invoke-agent. The 4 tick-modulo maintenance sub-tasks (FTS rebuild, history/SEL prune, skill-curator aging, consolidator check — today locked to a hard-coded 60s interval) become visible, pausable `created_by: system` triggers with real cron cadences (transparency win; the modulo-coupling gotcha dies). HEARTBEAT.md stays as an import surface — a `kind:file` watcher syncs lines → triggers (one-way import; two-way sync deferred). `HEARTBEAT_KEEP` retry semantics preserved via the `deferred` outcome. Optionally the maintenance set collapses into ONE health-scored doctor trigger (§4.1) |
| Commitments delivery | **ABSORBED** | Commitments live in `memory_service.py` (a MemoryKind, not a file — recon); each due commitment becomes a one-shot `clock/at` trigger with `delete_after_run` (per §1.2), replacing the per-tick `due_commitments_all` scan. Guardrails (opt-in config, confidence ≥0.8, ≤3/day/agent) untouched — they are memory-subsystem policy, not substrate policy |
| Inbox poll loop | **KEPT as a service** | Provider polling is plumbing, not user automation. It gains ONE new duty: emit `InboxItemIngested` onto the event bus. The 6h maintenance sub-loop → a system clock trigger |
| Inbox alerts (`evaluate_alert`) | **ABSORBED** | → `Trigger{kind:event, ContentMatch on InboxItemIngested} → notify`. Settings UI writes edit-locked system triggers. Kills the third matcher implementation. Preserved gotcha: evaluation happens at ingestion; editing keywords doesn't re-evaluate stored items (documented, unchanged). "AI digest every morning" ships as a template |
| `fs_watch.py` | **KEPT + gains a consumer** | Stays the SSE refresh engine (3s poll, mtime+size signature); additionally publishes `FileChanged`. **Scope guard:** `kind:file` triggers register EXPLICIT watch roots with a path-count cap and a warning on broad globs — the poller must not become a battery drain. Watch-root registration is part of trigger validation |
| `after_turn_review.py` | **KEPT as code**, surfaced as a read-only row | The learning pipeline is hot-path and cheap; per-turn run records would be journal spam. Appears on the Automations page as an informational row (on/off wired to `config.learning`) marked "runs outside the engine" — data model records `execution: external`, so the substrate's invariant stays honest. (This is MEMORY-side machinery — LEARNING-FLYWHEEL owns its evolution) |
| `suggestions.py`, `engagement_signals.py` | **KEPT lazy / KEPT** | Read-time computation; the counter-example stays the counter-example |
| `/api/triggers` facade + `schedule_trigger.py` | **KEPT — becomes the single API** | The facade already exists (namespaced `kind:<raw>` ids over 3 stores, routes for toggle/run/test/to-chat/ack). Unification re-points it at triggers.json instead of three stores; the id namespace becomes the migration map. `schedule_trigger` (CLI + MCP) already fires via HTTP `/run` with `X-Internal-Secret` — unchanged. **MCP-process gotcha carried over:** MCP tools mutate the store from a separate process; mtime `_sync` within the ≤30s poll remains the propagation contract |
| App crons (`apps/app_crons.py`) | **ABSORBED** | Manifest-declared jobs reconcile into triggers `created_by: app:<name>:<cron>` at startup exactly as today (pruned/converged, gated on `can_use_cron`, force-`silent` because the pseudo-user can't receive DM — all preserved) |

---

## 3. TriggerService (one scheduler)

One asyncio loop — **the existing single re-armed `_arm_timer` task generalized** (there is no heap to extend; recon confirmed the mechanism is one task sleeping `min(next-due-delay, 30s)`):

- The task computes the earliest `next_fire_at` across all clock/idle triggers and sleeps until it (capped at 30s for external-edit pickup via mtime `_sync`), coalescing same-second firings so N triggers replacing one 60s heartbeat don't wake the laptop N times.
- **Event bus subscription** for event/file/run_completed kinds; sync-context fires spool to `~/.gideon/trigger-spool.jsonl`, drained on next tick under the §3.3 cursor rule.
- Fire path (order matters): **injection screen (4a) → gates (debounce/quiet/cooldown/condition) → budget check pre-claim (R5, fail-closed) → overlap claim lock (R2) → yield/resource-slot check (R9) → fence payload → capability filter (R3) → resolve def / resume target → create run (full or ledger-only) → engine executes under the `headless` profile → outcome classification (§1.3) → delivery contract (decision 13) → health rollup + failure policy.**

Unattended LLM turns all route through `SubagentManager.spawn` with the `__wf_depth` cap and `session` binding (`pinned:cron:{id}` parity for stateful crons / `conversation:` for in-chat nudge rendering / fresh default — preserving today's `cron:{id}` / `cron:{id}:{uuid8}` conventions and the `_STATELESS_PREFIXES` reset behavior). The reaper (60s sweep, SIGKILL escalation, jitter allowance) is kept as defense-in-depth over ALL trigger-fired runs, not just crons.

### 3.1 Crash-safe scheduling discipline (AUTO-R1)

Layered onto the re-armed-task mechanism:

- **Persist-before-execute:** `next_fire_at` is computed on fire via the recurrence engine and PERSISTED to the trigger row *before* executing (never re-parse-on-poll), so a crash mid-fire cannot double-fire. This replaces the croniter-minute-match due check as the primary dueness source; the match logic moves into the recurrence engine.
- **Exactly-one-upcoming invariant:** exactly ONE persisted upcoming fire per enabled trigger, recovered/re-armed on gateway boot; interrupted queued/starting runs are re-queued or marked `failed('gateway restarted')`.
- **Single-flight per trigger** as an explicit invariant (OpenJARVIS); the overlap claim lock is its enforcement point.
- **Recompute-from-NOW after completion, anchored to `created_at`:** next fire is computed from completion time (never the missed slot — prevents re-fire storms when a run overruns its interval), but recurrence anchors to the trigger's `created_at` grid so recomputes don't re-phase to "now".
- **Wall-clock math in the trigger's IANA timezone**, convert to UTC last (9am Monday survives DST).
- **Minimum-interval floor** in trigger validation (15 min default for LLM-invoking clock triggers, overridable); a minute-level recurrence floor for everything (Khoj convergence).
- **Boot stagger:** overdue fires pushed +60s, staggered deterministically (reusing the per-id BLAKE2b jitter pattern) so a restart doesn't fire every automation at once.
- **Lock self-expiry:** the fire claim lock carries a `max_duration` self-expiry (Khoj's ProcessLock) so a crashed holder can never permanently wedge a trigger's next fire — complements the existing reaper.
- **Shipped-scheduler details (emdash):** 32-bit timer-ceiling clamping with automatic re-tick for far-future fires; re-fetch-and-revalidate trigger state on fire (bail if disabled/rescheduled mid-wait); refuse-enable-overdue-one-shot (force reschedule instead of surprise fire).
- **Deterministic ids** for feature-minted triggers (`system:<feature>:<slug>`) so re-registration at startup is idempotent — matching how app crons reconcile today.

### 3.2 Dispatch architecture: inbox + wakeup (AUTO-R16)

The scheduler never executes directly. A fired trigger enqueues a typed payload onto the target session's inbox queue + a wakeup signal; a **WakeupDispatcher** claims and drives runs. Two wakeup kinds with different drop semantics:

- **wake** — drain inbox; skipped entirely if the session is already running (the natural implementation of `overlap: skip`, and exactly the semantics autonudge already has for mid-turn nudges);
- **resume** — a gate-answer/HITL result for a parked run; **must re-queue until the parked lock releases** — overlap guards must never eat gate answers intended for parked runs (this is what makes R11 resume-targets and R13 approvals safe).

Crash-safety falls out: the payload survives an executor crash in the inbox. One code path serves all trigger kinds. All bus/queue key formats are centralized in one auditable module (the `MessageBusKeys` pattern) — extending the session-key conventions table (`cron:{id}`, `cron-{id}` dashboard pair, `_bg`, `loop-<id>`, …) rather than inventing a parallel one.

### 3.3 Event-bus delivery contract (AUTO-R6)

The bus is migration step 1 — it gets reliability semantics up front:

- Every trigger-dispatch record carries per-target `{status: pending|delivered|given-up, attempts}`; handler outcomes are typed `delivered|transient|permanent` (unexpected throw = transient, "never drop"); bounded give-up is loud-logged to the Run Ledger.
- **Consumer cursor rule:** the seq cursor advances ONLY on consumed events. Transient failures (prerequisite absent — provider down, key missing) HOLD the drain with a per-seq bounded retry counter (~5); permanent failures (payload bad) advance+log. The key-absent-vs-key-bad distinction prevents both event loss and poison-pill stalls. The `trigger-spool.jsonl` drain (the fix for event_triggers' verified sync-context skip) adopts this rule; **monotonic cursor per (trigger, stream)** so a repeatedly-firing trigger never reprocesses history.
- **Peek-then-deliver-then-ack** queue semantics (not atomic read-and-mark) — at-least-once delivery; events are acked/deleted only after an error-free handling cycle (AionUI's documented crash-loss bug is the counter-case).
- **SHA-256 payload-hash dedup window** (~5 min) at ingestion kills webhook/fs double-fires; stable deterministic event_ids make re-delivery idempotent.
- **Per-event-family coalescing windows** (50-250ms) and per-source rate floors that survive manual/force fires (force bypasses min-interval; `max_requests_per_sec`-class floors still apply).
- **Completeness rule:** every entity CRUD in the gateway emits a typed event on the one bus, so triggers subscribe to entity lifecycle without per-surface glue.
- The hook-recursion storm case (a run's own lifecycle events re-matching its trigger) is an explicit cycle-guard TEST, backed by decision 5's spawned_by skip.
- Anti-flood logging: held/backlog counts logged only on change.

### 3.4 Missed fires: review, don't lie and don't storm (AUTO-R8)

On gateway startup, enumerate fires elapsed while down (cap ~480): create MissedRun ledger records for the newest ~20 per trigger, presented as a **review card** on the Automations page (run-now → recorded `ran_late`; dismiss → `skipped_missed`); older collapse into ONE summarizing entry per trigger; `next_fire_at` rolls forward so re-opens don't re-enumerate. The per-trigger `catch_up: bool` (launchd RunAtLoad semantics) fires once automatically at boot/wake when the last slot was missed — storm-guarded to at most ONE catch-up run per trigger, **staggered across triggers at startup, tagged `trigger: 'catchup'`** (a distinct ledger origin), and backstopped by the per-trigger `max_runs_per_hour` sliding window (which manual fires bypass). Local-first means lid-closed = the loop stopped; this is the missing half of the runs-inbox story.

### 3.5 Foreground yield + resource slots (AUTO-R9)

Gideon shares one machine between the interactive user and local models (whisper, embeddings, ollama):

- Per-trigger `yield_to_user` — background fires wait for a quiet window (no in-flight interactive HTTP ~1.5s, no browser heartbeat ~45s, no live model stream; passive/polling endpoints excluded); a running yielded fire is cancelled+deferred with escalating backoff (~15min) when the user becomes active.
- **Named resource slots** — triggers/runs declare needs (`gpu`, `local-llm`); the substrate serializes conflicting runs per slot and refuses over-capacity starts with a typed `RESOURCE_BUSY` + holder identity (a `deferred` ledger row).
- Optional `skip_if_active` guard on mutating triggers using cheap liveness heuristics (dirty worktree, lockfiles, recent mtime) at fire time, plus an `acting_on` resource claim so two trigger-fired runs never mutate the same target concurrently.

### 3.6 Budgets + triage (AUTO-R5)

- Budget gates checked PRE-claim against a persistent per-window budget table for LLM-invoking fires; breaches → `skipped_budget` rows + inbox alert + autopause on sustained breach; budget-check errors **fail-closed**. Metered by LLM-cost weight, not run count — deterministic/transform-only runs are cheap/exempt.
- `model_tier: background|standard` per trigger, resolved ONCE via config so all 24/7 loops share one cheap-model knob — implemented over the existing use-case machinery: background fires resolve through `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` / the `reasoning` axis (recon: chat/code_tools resolution returns the NativeAgentRuntime — background callers must use the reasoning axis), bound in `active_models.json`.
- **Fire→spawn triage stage** — recommended DEFAULT for noisy event/webhook/inbox triggers (three-source convergence: CORE's shouldAct/shouldSurface/shouldIgnore, LocalAGI's ClassifierFilter, the R5 lever): a small local model evaluates per-trigger NL rules ("from Gmail only extract action items; skip newsletters") and verdicts `{drop | notify | spawn-ledger-only | spawn-full}`, decisions cached on trigger fingerprint. Doubles as a storm guard. `skipped_triage` rows carry the rationale.
- Automations rows show `cost_estimate = last-run cost × fires_in_window(30d)`; the recurrence engine also powers a next-fires calendar preview. Goal-style triggered runs carry max-turns + a stop condition; a **no-improvement-halt** stop-condition (score unchanged across N firings suspends the trigger and files a needs-input item) covers self-improvement loops (R12 am.).
- Poka-yoke review of action-provider config schemas (enums over free text, absolute paths, no silent coercion) — applied to the `settingsSchema` in each `<provider>-action` extension manifest.

### 3.7 Health + typed exits + parking (AUTO-R7)

- Typed run-exit taxonomy: `ok / partial (resumable, cursor persisted) / auth_unavailable / transport_unavailable / failed` — with per-outcome `failure_policy` (auto-refire on partial; alert-and-pause on auth_unavailable; **only true failures count toward autopause_after: 5** — generalizing the existing gateway `_maybe_autopause`, which today covers only the cron action path).
- `stall_after_s` in run policy: a run emitting no ledger events for N seconds renders "stalled" vs "running".
- Trigger firing gates on capability-level readiness of the target provider/runtime; unhealthy targets → parking per decision 9.
- Health rollups (`last_success_at/last_failure_at/health_status/last_error_summary`) updated on every fire — the Automations list renders status dots O(triggers), not O(runs).

---

## 4. Chat Tools

One namespace replacing `schedule_add/…` + ad-hoc trigger creation:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `automation_create` | `(name, trigger{kind, spec}, workflow{ref\|inline_action\|resume}, gates?, capabilities?, session?, delivery?)`. NL-friendly: `when: "every weekday at 9"` routes through `nl_to_cron`; `when: "when a file in ~/notes changes"` → file kind. Write-capable `capabilities` echo back a confirmation |
| `automation_list` | `(kind?, state?)` — includes health rollups |
| `automation_update` | `(id, patch)` |
| `automation_pause` / `automation_resume` | `(id)` |
| `automation_run` | `(id, dry_run?)` — manual fire / observe-mode replay (bypasses min-interval + max_runs_per_hour, never rate floors) |
| `automation_history` | `(id, n?)` — run/fire rows incl. typed outcomes + step statuses (agents self-debug their automations) |
| `automation_doctor` | read-only check set (§4.1) |
| `automation_delete` | `(id, confirm: true)` |

Agent-created triggers are tagged `created_by: agent`, announced to the user on creation, capped (decision 5d), and visible on the Automations page. MCP `schedule_*` tools kept as thin aliases for one release, then removed — after the grace release the policy layer **denies** them (§4.1). CLI: `gideon automation` with a `cron` alias. **Recon carry-over:** MCP tools run in a separate process writing the shared store; propagation stays mtime-`_sync`-within-30s; immediate firing goes through HTTP `/run` (the `schedule_trigger` pattern).

### 4.1 Substrate integrity tooling (AUTO-R15)

- **OS-scheduler gate + on-ramp:** the policy layer force-prompts word-bounded OS-scheduler commands in Bash (`crontab`, `launchctl`, `schtasks`, `systemd-run`) — added to `denied_command_patterns()` machinery as prompt-tier, not hard-deny; a startup crontab/launchd scan surfaces Gideon-ish entries as a one-click migrate-to-Trigger banner. The invariant "every background behavior = a Trigger" only holds if agents can't route around it into invisible OS schedules.
- **Automation doctor:** read-only checks (unknown kinds, orphaned workflow refs, cycle potential, broad file-watch globs, stale next_fire) each PASS/WARN/FAIL with suggested fix — optionally run as ONE health-scored maintenance trigger that builds a dependency-ordered remediation plan under target-score/cost-cap semantics with adaptive idle cadence (healthy → sleep longer), replacing N independent maintenance crons. Health probes never raise to 500 (exceptions → ok=false, secrets masked).
- **Dry-fire smoke gate** button on the Automations page (`--check` style): boot the workflow, verify health + event stream, exit without side effects — catching dead triggers before the nightly batch.
- **Lenient ingestion + audit:** never-throw structural parse (§1); per-trigger append-only JSONL change audit (`{ts, who, diff}`) surfaced as "who changed this automation". First paint of the Automations page is one bulk endpoint with per-row error isolation.

---

## 5. FE — One Automations Page

Replaces `pages/triggers/` + `pages/schedule/`:

### 5.1 Triggers list

Grouped by kind, state chips, `created_by` badges (system rows edit-locked), next-fire for clocks, **health status dot from rollups** (R7), **write-capability badge** (R3), **cost estimate + next-fires preview** (R5). Create flow = two-field form (When: kind picker + NL box → parsed spec confirmed; Do: action editor or workflow picker); "Advanced" folds out gates/capabilities/session/delivery. Clock UI: Recurring/Once tabs + presets + raw-cron escape hatch + live next-fire preview (R12). Row affordances: **Run Now** and **Duplicate** (copy trigger+workflow, new id, disabled by default) (R18), dry-fire smoke gate (R15). The **missed-fire review card** (§3.4) renders at top after a boot with missed slots. A **global kill switch** (decision 7) pauses all background execution.

### 5.2 Runs inbox

Reverse-chron feed of runs/fires across all triggers with the §1.3 **typed outcome vocabulary** — every skip/defer/refusal visible with its one-line reason; no-op rows auto-archived out of the default view; All/Failed/Needs-input filters; needs-input pinned to top. Productive rows carry the "written/learned" diff section + artifact permalinks. **Strictly read-only — viewing never consumes/acks; a separate explicit action does** (lifeglance tray rule). Click-through to the run journal via the same statusUrl the delivery contract emits.

**Needs-input rows are durable approval objects (AUTO-R13):** `{id, requested_action, payload_preview, policy_rule_matched, request_context, ttl_seconds, auto_reject_on_expiry, reviewed_by/at/note, status}` — live wait = asyncio.Event backed by a durable row; a background sweeper expires by TTL; **pending waiters are RE-ARMED from disk on gateway restart** (Gideon restarts constantly — without re-arm every restart orphans pending approvals). Approval waits inside trigger-fired (unattended) runs use a short timeout (~30s → fail fast into the needs-input inbox as a resumable item, which a resume-target trigger can later resolve) vs long attended timeouts. Needs-input queue depth surfaces on the Automations page.

### 5.3 Templates

Bundled defs with a trigger pre-attached: Morning inbox digest, Watch-folder summarize (→ knowledge store), Weekly memory review (clock-only launchable, per decision 7), Commitment reminder, Idle-nudge, **Morning web digest** (web_watch sources → new-items foreach → rule-grammar filter → one digest) (R10). One-click install → editable trigger.

---

## 6. What We Deliberately Do NOT Build

- No visual graph builder as primary authoring (OpenAI Agent-Builder anti-lesson: it lost to code/chat). The graph is a readable spec the chat agent writes and the user reviews.
- No standalone "agent app" surface — automations live inside chat (widget, notifications) + one page.
- No RBAC/sharing. `created_by` is provenance, not permissions; webhook scoped tokens are auth, not roles.
- No matcher DSL beyond glob+regex+keywords.
- **No 3-state circuit breakers** — parking + typed exits only (decision 9).
- **No full auto-catch-up and no silent skip** for missed fires — review card + opt-in per-trigger `catch_up` (decision 8).
- **No raw-screen-frame pulse** — `pulse` watches memory/context deltas; screen capture is the separate opt-in `observe` kind, app-delivered, Phase 2.
- No second notification path — delivery routes through `DashboardState.notify` + `notification_allowed()`.

---

## 7. Migration Order (each step ships independently)

1. **Event bus + absorb `event_triggers.py`** with the §3.3 reliability contract from day one + new sources (fs_watch `FileChanged`, inbox `InboxItemIngested`, entity-CRUD events) + **fire sites for the 8 dormant `HOOK_EVENTS`** + inbox alerts re-pointed. Lowest-risk, highest-new-capability; the bus is the proof-of-pattern. Fencing hardening (decision 4: screen, strip, provenance, typed extraction) lands here because the bus is the trust boundary.
2. **Trigger store unification**: `triggers.json` + row-for-row cron migration (old file read-only one release; `gideon automation verify-migration` diff command). **The existing `/api/triggers` facade becomes the single API by re-pointing its three backends at one store — its `kind:<raw>` id namespace is the migration map.** Lenient parse + change audit (R15) land with the store.
3. **Crash-safe scheduler + dispatch**: §3.1 discipline (persist-before-execute, boot sweep, stagger, single-flight) layered onto the re-armed timer task; §3.2 inbox+wakeup dispatcher; `headless` unattended profile; missed-fire review + `catch_up` (§3.4).
4. **Run-record integration**: two-weight records with the full §1.3 outcome vocabulary + materiality classification; typed exits + health rollups + parking (§3.7); generalized autopause; budget gates + background model tier (§3.6, minus triage).
5. **Lifecycle hooks** → kind:event (blocking special case + agent scoping preserved); hooks.json migrated; batched stat writes. **Heartbeat** → system triggers + HEARTBEAT.md one-way import; delete `HeartbeatService`. Commitments → one-shot `at` triggers with `delete_after_run`.
6. **Capability allowlists + secrets**: decision 7 enforcement chain (frozen action sets, PathGuard, kill switch, provider chokepoint tests) + `{{secret:KEY}}` templating + scoped webhook tokens (decisions 11/12).
7. **FE Automations page** (list + runs inbox + approval objects + missed-fire card + templates); delivery contract (decision 13); retire `pages/schedule/` + `pages/triggers/`.
8. **New kinds wave 1**: `view`, `web_watch`, `run_completed`, composite shape, condition gates, `vcs`/sequence variants; fire→spawn triage stage default-on for noisy sources; foreground yield + resource slots (§3.5). Doctor + OS-scheduler gate + dry-fire (§4.1).
9. **Autonudge → kind:idle** — only after LOOPS-EVOLUTION Phase 4; then delete `autonudge.py`. Retire `schedule_*` aliases (deny via policy layer); update `snapshot.py`/`portability.py` to carry `triggers.json` + the ledger (**recon: today snapshot covers crons.json/hooks.json but NOT event_triggers.json/autonudge.json — the unified store closes that gap**).
10. **Phase 2 (separate go/no-go)**: `pulse` + standing delegations (R19); `observe` app (R20). Both propose-by-default; auto-execute must be earned per matter class.

---

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Loops coupling (autonudge is the loop tick engine) | kind:idle ships early for user automations; loop-ticker absorption strictly after LOOPS-EVOLUTION Phase 4; two idle engines coexist in the interim |
| Run-record flood | Two-weight records + materiality predicate + no-op auto-archive + ledger TTL (~30d) + tiered retention from the v2 plan; `view` kind never fires unviewed |
| Double-fire / restart storm / DST drift | §3.1 discipline: persist-before-execute, exactly-one-upcoming, anchored recurrence, tz-last conversion, boot stagger, single-flight, lock self-expiry |
| Timer wake-storm on laptop | Single re-armed next-deadline task (the existing mechanism), same-second coalescing, deterministic jitter kept |
| Migration trust (crons are the most-loved automations) | Row-for-row migration + read-only legacy file + verify-migration diff command; execution model already canonical `action {provider, config}` so only the store moves |
| Webhook/inbox payloads reaching unattended LLMs | Decision 4's six-rule fencing (screen → strip → fence-with-provenance → schema-extract → no-payload-matching → ssrf gate), substrate-enforced, fail-closed |
| Injected run DOING harm despite fencing | Decision 7 capability allowlists: read-only default for auto-fired, frozen action sets, write scopes, trust-origin chain, kill switch — text fencing alone does not bound actions |
| Trigger cycles (workflow-minted triggers, flywheel loops) | provenance_chain (direct) + spawned_by lineage skip (indirect) + global rate cap + agent-trigger cap & announcement + auto-retiring resume watchers + cycle-guard test |

## Provider & Config Plug-in Map

Where each new piece plugs into the pluggable-provider architecture (recon: providers.md) — nothing here invents a parallel extension path:

- **Action providers stay THE execution seam.** Every trigger kind dispatches through `action_providers/registry.py` exactly as schedule/hooks/event-triggers do today. Any NEW action provider (e.g. a future `digest` action) follows the existing rule: implement `ActionProvider`, register via `register_action_provider` (core) or ship as an app with `provider: {type: "action", implementation: "provider:create_provider"}` (the `apps/webhook-action` precedent — webhook is already OUT of core), **AND add its name to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555)** or trigger create/update rejects it. Settings schema via a `<name>-action` extension manifest.
- **Trigger kinds as extension points:** core kinds (clock/event/idle/file/webhook/view/web_watch/manual/run_completed) are native. Phase-2 `observe` ships as an **app-delivered provider** (capture daemon + extraction workflow in an app; its capture toggle is a `created_by: system` trigger row), consistent with the app platform's manifest/permissions model (`permissions.cron`, `permissions.events`). If a pluggable trigger-source seam is warranted, it enters `PROVIDER_TYPES` + a `_TypeHandler` **together** (recon: `test_manifest_types_match_handlers` guards the #47 bug class — never add one side only).
- **Background LLM resolution** uses the existing use-case machinery: `one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` / the `reasoning` axis via `active_models.json` bindings — never the chat/code_tools axis (which returns the NativeAgentRuntime). The triage stage binds a small local model the same way (a use-case ref like `ollama-models:<small>`); local models arrive via the established `LocalModelProvider` app path.
- **New config = an `AutomationConfig` section**, wired through the FOUR points (recon: persistence-security gotcha #1): (a) dataclass fields with `_meta(label, help)` (schema reachability tests enforce), (b) `AppConfig.load()` explicit field-by-field mapping (omission = silently dropped), (c) `to_dict()` (new top-level section must be added), (d) `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist + FE for runtime-editable knobs. Fields promoted from today's module constants: event rate cap, dedup windows, min-interval floor, budget defaults, yield thresholds, ledger TTL. (Heartbeat's non-configurable 60s dies with `HeartbeatService`.)
- **Egress:** `web_watch` and payload-derived fetches go through `net.fetch` with an `EgressPolicy` profile via `egress_policy_for()`; the headless escalation tier pre-flights `guard.evaluate` (web/render.py pattern). Never hand-rolled aiohttp.
- **Fencing/security:** `security.fence_untrusted` extended (provenance attrs) and re-exported unchanged via `sdk.security` for apps; the injection screen and PathGuard live beside `security.py`'s existing deny machinery; SEL (`sel.py`) receives audit events for capability violations, secret resolutions, and OS-scheduler prompts, as it does for egress/skill installs today.
- **Delivery:** through `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()` (providers/entity_routes.py) — the entity-settings gate stays THE gate; channel formatting uses the registered `ChannelTransportProvider`s (webui, slack app).
- **Knowledge vs memory routing:** workflows writing user items call the knowledge pipeline (`gideon.knowledge.*`); memory-writing workflow classes go through the memory subsystem and are launch-gated per decision 7. Future knowledge providers (Drive, Photos) slot into the existing `knowledge_providers` seam without touching the substrate.

---

## Implementation Effort

- **9 sessions core + Phase 2 track** (after v2 Slices 0-2) — up from 5 in rev 1; the added scope is R1-R18.
- Session 1-2: event bus + reliability contract + event-trigger absorption + dormant-hook fire sites + fencing hardening (steps 1)
- Session 3: trigger store + facade re-point + migration tooling + lenient parse/audit (step 2)
- Session 4: crash-safe scheduler + wakeup dispatcher + headless profile + missed-fire review (step 3)
- Session 5: run records + outcome vocabulary + health/parking + budgets (step 4)
- Session 6: hooks + heartbeat + commitments conversion (step 5)
- Session 7: capabilities + secrets (step 6)
- Session 8: FE Automations page + approvals + delivery contract + templates (step 7)
- Session 9: new kinds wave 1 + triage + yield/slots + doctor + validation + cleanup (step 8; autonudge deferred to loops timeline, step 9 rides that)
- Phase 2 (`pulse`, `observe`): separately scoped after the substrate proves out — both are `large` and gated on a go/no-go.

## Success Criteria

1. Every cron in a real user store migrates losslessly (verify-migration diff empty) and fires identically — including deterministic jitter, tz, skip_dates, persistent-session semantics.
2. "When a file in ~/notes changes, summarize it into my knowledge base" is creatable in chat in one message (and the summary lands in the knowledge store, not memory).
3. A failing automation autopauses after 5 *true* failures (typed exits — auth/transport outages park instead) and surfaces in the Runs inbox.
4. A hook, an event trigger, and a cron all show run history in the same feed with the same record shape and typed outcomes.
5. The event kind has full API parity (toggle/update/run/test/history) — closing today's facade gap — and the 8 dormant lifecycle events actually fire.
6. An inbox item containing prompt-injection text cannot steer an unattended digest run (fencing verified adversarially) **and cannot cause any action outside the trigger's frozen capability set** (allowlist verified adversarially).
7. Kill the gateway mid-fire and restart: no double-fire, no lost fire, missed slots appear in the review card, pending approvals re-arm, `catch_up` triggers fire exactly once, staggered.
8. Every suppressed fire (overlap/budget/gate/triage/noop) appears as a typed ledger row with a reason — zero silent drops under a 24h storm test.
9. A per-minute noisy webhook stays within budget, triages most fires to `skipped_triage`/ledger-only, and never degrades interactive chat latency (yield + slots verified with a local model loaded).
10. A completed-run notification deep-links (statusUrl) to the exact run journal row; a retried delivery does not double-ping.
11. `{{secret:KEY}}` never appears resolved in triggers.json, journals, ledger, or `automation_history` output.
12. An agent attempting `crontab -e` is prompted and offered the substrate; `automation doctor` flags an orphaned workflow ref and a broad file-watch glob.

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — sibling-platform gap analysis, owner greenlight)

**What & why.** Calendar-aware scheduling + schedule legibility, landing HERE on the UNIFIED trigger schema (owner decision: not front-run into the legacy cron store). Recon against the plan + code: `skip_dates`, per-schedule IANA `timezone`, deterministic BLAKE2b jitter, and `strict_schedule` **already exist on `ScheduleJob`** (schedule.py:136-144, jitter at :1183-1213) and the Trigger entity already reserves `gates.skip_dates?` and `gates.quiet_hours?` (§1.1) — so this amendment's job is to (a) carry skip_dates/tz/jitter/strict into the unified `clock` spec verbatim (already promised in §1.2's kind table; here made an explicit acceptance bar), (b) **specify quiet windows properly** (the reserved `quiet_hours?` key has no semantics today): time-of-day/day-of-week suppression with per-trigger catch-up-or-skip resolution, (c) add a pluggable **duty-gate** predicate hook (is-the-user-on-duty; provider-supplied — e.g. a future calendar app), and (d) a **week-grid visual view** of all schedules, which no current surface offers (`pages/schedule/` + `pages/triggers/` are lists only).

**Design (contract level).**
- `clock` spec fields (unified schema): `tz: str` (IANA, per-schedule — wall-clock math per §3.1), `skip_dates: [ISO date]`, `jitter: bool = True` with `strict_schedule: bool = False` as the opt-out (semantics + the deterministic per-id BLAKE2b offset kept verbatim from schedule.py — a migrated cron fires in the same sub-window slot).
- `gates.quiet_windows: [{days: [mon..sun], start: "HH:MM", end: "HH:MM", on_suppress: "catch_up" | "skip"}]`, evaluated in the trigger's tz at the gates stage of the §3 fire path. `skip` → `skipped_gate` ledger row (existing vocabulary, zero silent drops); `catch_up` → the fire defers to window-end via the existing `deferred` outcome + §3.4's one-catch-up-per-trigger storm guard (a 6-hour quiet window over a per-minute trigger yields ONE window-end fire, not 360).
- `gates.duty_gate: {provider: str, config: dict}` — a new provider seam `DutyGateProvider{name, async def on_duty(now, trigger_ctx) -> DutyVerdict{on_duty: bool, reason: str}}` in a `duty_gates/` registry (flat-dict, action_providers shape; app-contributed via `provider: {type: "duty_gate", …}` — `PROVIDER_TYPES` + `_TypeHandler` in the SAME commit, the #47 rule). Evaluation is fail-open with a time-box (a broken calendar app must not silence automations — the §1.4 decision-1 gate classification) and LLM-free by contract. Core ships one built-in: `manual` (a user on/off-duty toggle). off-duty → `skipped_gate` with the verdict reason.
- **Week-grid view:** the Automations page (§5.1) gains a Week tab — a 7×24 grid plotting each enabled clock trigger's fires for the coming week from the recurrence engine (which §3.6 already requires for the next-fires calendar preview — same computation, richer render). Quiet windows render as shaded bands; skip_dates as struck columns; duty-gate-suppressed slots dimmed. Read-only; click-through to the trigger row. Data: one endpoint `GET /api/triggers/week?start=<date>` returning computed occurrences (no store changes).
- Config: gate defaults (`automation.default_quiet_windows`, `automation.duty_gate_default`) join `AutomationConfig`, 4-point wired.

**Lands in:** quiet windows + skip_dates/tz/jitter carry-through extend **Session 3** (crash-safe scheduler — the recurrence engine is built there); duty-gate seam extends **Session 7** (capabilities — it is a fire-path policy hook); the week grid extends **Session 8** (FE Automations page). Count 9 → **10 sessions** (the three extensions together are one honest session).

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUTO-A1 | Unified `clock` spec carries `tz`/`skip_dates`/`jitter`+`strict_schedule` (deterministic offset preserved byte-compatibly from schedule.py) + `gates.quiet_windows` with catch_up\|skip semantics in the fire path; ledger outcomes `skipped_gate`/`deferred` used, never silence | trigger store/model module, TriggerService fire path, recurrence engine | migrated cron fires in its old jitter slot; a fire inside a quiet window yields exactly one `skipped_gate` (skip) or one window-end fire (catch_up) under a storm test; DST fixture holds per-trigger tz |
| AUTO-A2 | `DutyGateProvider` seam: registry + `duty_gate` provider type (+ handler, same commit) + built-in `manual` toggle; fail-open time-boxed evaluation; verdict reason on the ledger row; SDK re-export for app-contributed gates | `duty_gates/` package, `providers/registry.py`, `apps/manifest.py` PROVIDER_TYPES, `sdk/` facade | off-duty verdict suppresses with reason; a hanging gate provider fails open within the time-box; `test_manifest_types_match_handlers` green |
| AUTO-A3 | Week-grid view: `GET /api/triggers/week` (computed occurrences incl. quiet-window/skip-date/duty annotations) + the Automations Week tab (7×24 grid, shaded quiet bands, click-through) | triggers handler, `web/src/pages/` Automations page | the grid matches the recurrence engine's next-fires for every enabled clock trigger over 7 days; annotations render; both themes/WCAG pass |

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — gap analysis round 2, owner decisions)

**Coordination note: app-contributed trigger SOURCES are a real seam, not a maybe.** The Plug-in Map already hedges: "If a pluggable trigger-source seam is warranted, it enters `PROVIDER_TYPES` + a `_TypeHandler` together" (the #47 rule). Owner decision (via CHANNEL-EXPANSION's round-2 vendor-completeness pattern): it IS warranted — vendor channel apps (Slack the exemplar; telegram/discord/email inheriting) ride this seam for **remote triggers** (e.g. Slack events as trigger sources), so the hedge becomes a commitment. The unified TriggerService must accept **provider-registered source types from app manifests**: an app declares `provider: {type: "trigger_source", …}`; its implementation emits typed events onto the ONE event bus under a namespaced source (`app:<name>:<event>`), which `kind: event` triggers then match with the existing `{source, pattern}` spec — no new trigger kind, no second matcher, no bespoke per-vendor glue. Everything already designed keeps governing app-sourced fires unchanged: §3.3's bus reliability contract, decision 4's fencing at the trust boundary (app-sourced payloads are untrusted text — `fence_untrusted(source="trigger:app:<name>:…")`), decision 5's storm guards + the `created_by`/rate caps, decision 7's frozen capability allowlists, and the `headless` profile. The app side is bounded by the app platform's permission model (an `events`-emit grant surfaced at install consent — coordination line to APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION); enable/disable of the app registers/unregisters the source, and triggers bound to a vanished source park with a typed reason (decision 9 semantics), never silently die.

Fits the round-1 amendment cleanly: `duty_gate` (AUTO-A2) already establishes the app-contributed-provider-type pattern in this plan — `trigger_source` is its sibling, landing with the same PROVIDER_TYPES + `_TypeHandler` same-commit discipline.

**Lands in:** Session 9 (new kinds wave 1 — where the event-source surface is already being widened); a sharpening, **no session-count change** (count stays 10 per round 1).

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUTO-A4 | `trigger_source` provider seam: `PROVIDER_TYPES` + `_TypeHandler` (same commit), manifest declaration + install-consent surfacing, namespaced `app:<name>:<event>` bus sources with mandatory fencing + provenance at ingestion; app disable → bound triggers park typed; SDK re-export | `apps/manifest.py`, `providers/registry.py`, event-bus ingestion, `sdk/` facade, `tests/` (`test_manifest_types_match_handlers`) | a fixture app's source fires an `event` trigger end-to-end (fenced payload, frozen capabilities honored); disabling the app parks its triggers with a reason row; #47 guard green; core contains no vendor names |

## Execution log

### S62 — The Trigger entity, per-kind specs, and typed fire records (72 tests) — DONE

Entity layer only, deliberately. The scheduler is 63, dispatch is 64, migration is 66 — and the shape
has to be settled first because the migration is the step that cannot be redone cheaply.

**The measurement that shaped the session.** `ScheduleJob` has 33 fields and `EventTrigger` 11.
Checked against the new dataclass: **31 of those 44 have no same-named home on `Trigger`.** A
migration written against the dataclass alone would silently drop `skip_dates` (the trigger keeps
firing on a holiday), `strict_schedule` (a missed slot catches up when the author said not to),
`content_re` (an event trigger fires on everything) and the delivery/session fields. So
`LEGACY_FIELD_MAP` lands in THIS session rather than in 66, mapping every one of the 44 to a
destination — with `None` plus a reason for the deliberate drops, because an unexplained omission
is indistinguishable from an oversight when someone reads it in six months.
`unmapped_legacy_fields()` runs the check against the REAL dataclasses, so a field added to
`ScheduleJob` next month fails a test here instead of vanishing during the migration.

Contracts made checkable rather than trusted:

- **Never-throw structural validation (R15).** `parse_trigger` returns `(trigger, issues)` and never
  raises — verified against `None`, `[]`, a string, an int and `{}`. A near-miss key yields a warning
  naming the closest known field (`debounce_seconds` → `debounce_secs`), and a far-off name suggests
  NOTHING: suggesting `timezone` for `xyzzy` is worse than silence, because the reader trusts it. A
  structurally broken trigger loads DISABLED — visible and editable, which is what makes the warning
  actionable, but never dispatched.
- **Silent drops are banned (R2).** `Outcome` is closed (12 members) and `fire_issues` asserts that
  every non-clean outcome carries a one-line reason — the rule is only real if something checks it,
  since a suppression written without a reason satisfies the type and defeats the purpose. A
  parameterized test walks all 12 outcomes rather than spot-checking three.
- **Only a TRUE failure counts toward autopause.** Five skipped fires because quiet hours held is the
  configuration working; autopausing for that would punish the user for saying "not at night".
- **Productivity is the materiality predicate, not the outcome.** A run can end `ran` and have touched
  nothing, so the runs-inbox view keys on `mutated` — an outcome-based view would show a page of runs
  that changed nothing.
- **Gate failure modes are classified per gate**, and an UNCLASSIFIED gate fails CLOSED. Budget and
  storm guards fail open (a hung budget probe must not stop every automation); security fences do not.
  The default for a gate nobody classified is refusal, because that is the safe direction for a
  control whose semantics are unknown.
- **Phase-2 kinds (`pulse`, `observe`) are NOT accepted yet.** A kind the service cannot dispatch
  would let a user author a trigger that never fires — the exact failure the never-throw validation
  exists to prevent.
- **A webhook with no `token_ref` is refused, not defaulted.** A generated default would be a secret
  nobody chose.

Notes for the sessions that follow: `fires_automatically` asks `enabled` AND `state` AND `kind` in one
place, because checking `enabled` alone is how an autopaused trigger keeps firing. `classify_weight`
is the ledger-vs-full rule (≥2 nodes, any LLM, or resumable ⇒ full) that keeps a minutely trigger from
producing 1440 run directories a day.

- **NOT DONE (by scope):** `TriggerService`, the disposition table, dispatch, the cron migration, and
  the API surface. No store either — `triggers.json` arrives with the service that owns its lock.

### S63 — The disposition table as code + crash-safe scheduling discipline (52 tests) — DONE

§2 is explicit that `schedule.py` is ABSORBED by **rename, not rewrite**, so this session layers the
discipline onto the shipped mechanism instead of replacing it. Everything is a pure decision the
service applies, which is what makes it assertable without a running gateway.

**The property measured first, because getting it wrong breaks migration day.** The shipped
`ScheduleService._jitter_offset` spreads jobs into stable id-derived slots via BLAKE2b. If the trigger
service used a different algorithm, every migrated schedule would land in a different sub-minute slot
than the job it came from — a silent re-phasing of every automation on the machine. `jitter_offset` is
now asserted **bit-identical** against the real shipped function for four ids including the empty one.
It is deliberately re-implemented rather than imported (the dependency would point the wrong way for
§2's absorb order), which is exactly why the parity test exists.

Each rule ships with the bug it prevents, because a scheduling rule with no named failure is one
nobody can review:

- **persist-before-execute** → a crash between "decided to fire" and "fired" double-fires. `is_due`
  reads the PERSISTED `next_fire_at` rather than re-deriving. Measured: the shipped `_is_due` guards a
  same-minute refire with `last_run_ts // 60 == now // 60`, which is correct for a live process and
  useless across a restart that loses the in-memory clock.
- **recompute-from-completion, anchored to the created-at grid** → two distinct bugs in one function.
  From completion, or a 90s run on a 60s interval is due the instant it finishes, forever, and the
  machine never idles. Anchored, or that recompute re-phases the schedule to whenever the overrun
  happened: a job created to run on the hour drifts to :07 after one slow day and stays there. A test
  walks four consecutive overruns and asserts every result lands back on the grid.
- **boot stagger** → a restart fires every automation at once. Overdue fires are pushed +60s and
  spread by the same id-derived jitter; the push is deterministic, so a crash-loop does not reshuffle
  every schedule on each restart. `catch_up` is RECORDED but still staggered — the plan's catch_up is
  "fire once at boot/wake", and doing it inline would run before the gateway finished starting
  (session 65 owns the exactly-once bookkeeping).
- **claim self-expiry** → a killed process wedges a trigger permanently. `CLAIM_MAX_DURATION_SECS`
  equals `workflows.pool.MAX_LEASE_SECS`, asserted: the same question (how long may one holder hold?)
  should not have two answers on one machine.
- **revalidate-on-fire** → a trigger disabled while the timer slept still fires once, which reads as
  the off switch not working — the single most damaging bug an automation surface can have. Also
  refuses a fire whose schedule moved mid-wait.
- **coalescing** → N triggers replacing one 60s heartbeat wake the laptop N times. The batch order is
  STABLE (fire time, then id), because an unstable order makes two runs of one batch interleave
  differently and any bug in one of them intermittent.

`claim_fire` takes the trigger's own `overlap` policy, so it is not a generic lock: `parallel` does not
refuse (the trigger opted in), while `skip` and `queue` both refuse and the *outcome the caller
records* carries the difference — this function's only job is whether THIS fire may proceed.

**The disposition table now lives as code** (`triggers/disposition.py`), 14 rows with a
`missing_surfaces()` check that imports every module it names. A markdown table cannot be verified
against the tree; this one fails a test if the migration renames something out from under it — the same
reasoning as S62's `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP`. `KEPT_WITH_DUTY` is a distinct verdict from `KEPT` because the
two produce different work: collapsing them would let a required emission (fs_watch publishing
`FileChanged`, the inbox emitting `InboxItemIngested`) read as "nothing to do here", and then the bus
has no publishers. Each ABSORBED row names what is preserved verbatim — "absorbed" without that list
is how a rewrite loses the semantics a rename would have kept.

- **NOT DONE (by scope):** the service loop itself, the store (`triggers.json` arrives with the service
  that owns its lock), dispatch/inbox+wakeup (§3.2, session 64), the event-bus contract (§3.3), and the
  cron migration (session 66) — which must use S62's `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP`.

### S64 — Dispatch (inbox + wakeup) and the event-bus delivery contract (45 tests) — DONE

**A shipped silent drop, reproduced before anything was written.** `event_triggers._schedule_fire`
records the fire, then calls `asyncio.get_running_loop()` and `return`s when there is none. Driven
against a real store in a sync context: `fire_count` becomes **1** and the action is **dropped with
nothing anywhere recording that it did not run**. That is exactly the silent drop §1.3 bans, in
shipped code — the plan calls it "the verified sync-CLI silent-skip" and it is verified now. The
reproduction is pinned as a test, so the spool cannot be removed without a failure showing why it
existed.

`trigger-spool.jsonl` is the fix, and its shape follows from the failure modes:

- **JSONL, append-only.** A partial write at power-loss damages one line; a single JSON array would
  lose every spooled fire to one truncated write. `drain_spool` skips a damaged line and reports the
  count rather than refusing the file.
- **Draining does NOT truncate.** Peek-then-deliver-then-ack applied to the spool — truncating on read
  would lose every spooled fire to a crash during handling, which is the same bug one layer up.
- **`clear_spool` keeps what arrived DURING the drain.** That window is exactly when a busy machine
  spools most, so an unconditional truncate drops the fires it was busiest producing.
- **A spool write failure does not break the caller.** The event is lost, but the memory write that
  triggered it still succeeds; the opposite trade would let an unwritable disk take down ordinary use.

The delivery contract, each rule with the failure it prevents:

- **The cursor advances only on CONSUMED events.** `delivered` → consume. `permanent` → consume
  loudly, because holding a bad payload forever is a poison pill that stalls every later event.
  `transient` → HOLD (the event is not lost; the next tick retries), until a bounded budget, then GIVE
  UP loudly — holding indefinitely on one unreachable provider would stop every other automation,
  which is worse than one loudly-dropped event.
- **An unclassified throw is TRANSIENT, not permanent.** A handler that raised on a network blip must
  be retried; treating an unclassified exception as permanent turns a recoverable failure into data
  loss. A handler that explicitly reports `permanent` is believed — it knows something the dispatcher
  cannot see.
- **The cursor is monotonic per (trigger, stream)** and `advance` refuses to move backwards, which is
  what stops enabling one trigger from replaying a month of history. Advancing resets the held-retry
  count, because a carried-over count would give the next event a shorter budget than the first.
- **Deterministic `event_id` from a sorted-key payload hash.** `json.dumps` preserves insertion order,
  so an unsorted hash would differ for two dicts with identical content — defeating the dedup window
  exactly when it matters, on a sender retrying with a re-serialized body. Verified: same id across key
  order AND across seq.
- **`is_duplicate` reads and does not mutate.** The caller records the hash only after deciding to
  process, so a crash between the check and the work leaves the event deliverable; marking inside the
  check would make dedup itself a source of dropped events.
- **`RESUME` is never droppable.** A `wake` may be skipped when the session is busy (the run in flight
  drains the inbox — that IS `overlap: skip`, and what autonudge already does for a mid-turn nudge),
  but a resume carries a gate answer for a parked run, and a guard that ate it would strand the run
  forever waiting for an answer the user already gave. An unknown kind is treated as droppable so a bad
  value cannot pin a busy session.
- **The cycle guard reads `spawned_by`, not a depth counter.** Depth catches the hook-recursion storm
  one level late, and by then a mutating automation has already made one unwanted write.
- **Coalescing keeps the LATEST of a family**, not the first: for a `FileChanged` burst, acting on the
  first means reading a file the user has since changed again. Events an hour apart are two facts, not
  a burst.
- **Delivery state is PER TARGET.** One fire can have several (notify AND inbox); a single status makes
  "delivered" mean "delivered somewhere", which a user reads as "it worked" when half of it did not. A
  dispatch with NO targets is not delivered — correct for `delivery: none`, a bug for anything else, so
  the honest answer is False and the caller decides.

- **NOT DONE (by scope):** the loop that drains the spool and the queue (that is the service), the
  missed-fire review card (§3.4, session 65), foreground yield and resource slots (§3.5), budgets and
  triage (§3.6), and the migration (66, which must use S62's `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP`).

### S65 — Missed fires: review, don't lie, don't storm (37 tests) — DONE

Local-first means a closed lid stops the loop, so the honest question after a restart is not "what
should have run" but "what do I tell the user about what didn't".

**The defect this session found in its own first draft.** The shared enumeration budget originally
bounded the COUNT. Driven with thirty triggers each down a week: the alphabetically-first minutely
trigger spent all 480 counting its own 10,080 missed slots, and **twenty-nine triggers got no review
card at all** — the page would have shown one automation and silently omitted the rest, which is exactly
the "don't lie" failure §3.4 names. Fixed by budgeting the ROWS BUILT instead: counting is one
division, allocating objects is what makes boot slow. Same budget, 24 of 30 triggers get cards, every
count stays exact so the summaries stay honest, and the body comment records the measurement so a later
"simplification" cannot reintroduce it.

**A second measurement, where the test was wrong and the code was right.** The newest MISSED slot is one
interval back, not `now`: the slot at `now` is DUE and the scheduler is about to fire it. Listing it as
missed would offer a review card for work already on its way. The assertion was corrected, not the
implementation, and the docstring now says why.

The three separations, each preventing a specific bad outcome:

- **Enumerate, bounded, honest.** The newest ~20 per trigger become reviewable rows; everything older
  collapses into ONE summary that still carries the exact count. `truncated` is a SEPARATE flag from
  the summaries because they answer different questions — a summary says "this trigger missed more than
  we listed", `truncated` says "the enumeration itself stopped early, so even the counts are a floor".
  Reporting a floor as a total is the same lie in different clothes.
- **Review, don't auto-run.** "Run the 3am backup now, at 9am" is sometimes right and sometimes exactly
  wrong, so it is the user's decision. Run-now records `ran_late`, dismiss records `skipped_missed`, and
  an unknown action is `refused` with a reason — every branch writes a ledger row, because a dismissed
  card that left no trace would be a silent drop with a UI on it.
- **`catch_up` fires ONCE, staggered, and explains its refusals.** Opt-in (RunAtLoad semantics are a
  choice, not a default), once per trigger regardless of how many slots were missed, and spread by the
  same deterministic per-id jitter the scheduler uses — without all three, a laptop opening after a
  weekend runs every automation it owns in the same second. A DISABLED trigger is never restarted by a
  catch-up: an automation the user switched off coming back to life because the machine rebooted is the
  most damaging possible reading of the feature. Every candidate gets an explanation including the
  refusals, because a `catch_up: true` trigger that did NOT fire needs one as much as one that did.

Two supporting rules: the hourly cap backstops catch-up but a MANUAL fire bypasses it (the cap exists
to stop the machine running away on its own, and a person clicking Run is not the machine running away),
and `roll_forward` preserves phase rather than rolling to `now + interval` — the same grid-anchoring
rule as the scheduler, so a re-open neither re-enumerates nor re-phases a schedule that was correct
before the machine slept.

- **NOT DONE (by scope):** the review card's FE surface, the boot sequence that calls these (the
  service), foreground yield and resource slots (§3.5), budgets and triage (§3.6), and the migration
  (66 — which must use S62's `LEGACY_FIELD_MAP`).
