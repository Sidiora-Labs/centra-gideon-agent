# PLATFORM-REACH

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/PR.md`](../atomic/PR.md) as 8 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Platform Reach — Reliable ARM + the Windows Ladder

**Status:** DESIGNED — deepened 2026-07-18 with code recon (initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18; owner: separate, independently prioritizable platform tracks)
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Wave:** 1 (Track A: ARM) + 2 (Track B: Windows rungs 1-2 + the rung-3 audit). Native Windows implementation deliberately unscheduled until the audit + demand evidence justify the permanent tax.
**Depends on:** CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING (matrix + multi-arch pipeline), DISTRIBUTION (wheels/images as delivery). MOBILE-COMPANION and DESKTOP-CAPABILITIES are separate plans.
**Scope:** ARM Linux + Apple Silicon become CI-proven first-class; Windows gets honest, tested paths. **Soul guardrail:** a platform is "supported" only when CI (or a per-release executed checklist) proves it — no support-matrix rows backed by hope. Anything not proven is labeled community-tested, explicitly.

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18)

- **SQLite fallback is real and load-bearing:** the `try: import pysqlite3 except: import sqlite3` pattern appears in `snapshot.py`, `knowledge/retrieval.py`, `memory.py`, `portability.py`, `vector_memory.py` (+ plain `sqlite3` in `loop/store.py`); **FTS5 is used by six modules** (`memory.py`, `vector_memory.py`, `knowledge/{retrieval,store}.py`, `dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py`, `memory_providers/filesystem.py`). `pysqlite3-binary` is pinned linux-x86_64-only — so every ARM Linux install already runs the stdlib path today, unverified. The ARM question is precisely: *does the platform's bundled SQLite carry FTS5 (+ JSON1), and do we detect it when it doesn't?*
- **Windows-blocking mechanisms, verified locations:** PPID-1 orphan reaping (`apps/backend_runtime.py`), Unix-only process calls concentrated in `sandbox.py` (fork/setsid/SIGHUP family), `0600` chmods (`.env`, `sel_hmac.key` via `config/loader.py::save_credential`, `sel.py`), the `static/dist` symlink (`frontend.py` — though wheels install a real dir, shrinking this to dev-only), PTY confined to `dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`, `service/` = `linux.py` + `macos.py` only.
- Desktop bundling excludes torch-class deps by design (`gideon-backend.spec`); ARM wheel audit therefore matters mostly for `[models]` server installs.

## Design

- **Track A (ARM):** CI proves it (ubuntu-arm + macos-14 arm64 runners); a **SQLite capability probe** becomes first-class: one helper (`sqlite_features()` → {driver, version, fts5, json1}) used by `doctor` (reported line) and by the six FTS5 consumers' init paths (fail with an actionable message when FTS5 is absent, instead of mid-query errors); multi-arch images become release-blocking; wheel audit documents `[models]`-extra degradations per arch; support matrix lands in README + docs, CI-backed.
- **Track B (Windows):** rung 1 = Docker Desktop (published images + a per-release checklist); rung 2 = WSL2 (docs + two small fixes: browser auto-open fallback, systemd note); rung 3 = a costed **audit only** against the verified mechanism list, producing a go/no-go with per-mechanism options (Job Objects vs PPID reaping; icacls vs chmod; junction/copy vs symlink; ConPTY via pywinpty vs disabling the terminal page; Windows Service vs Task Scheduler; sandbox degradation policy = the hard one, likely "no native sandbox on Windows, documented loudly").

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### C1 — `src/gideon/sqlite_compat.py` (new — absorbs the repeated try/except import)

```python
# The ONE place the driver is chosen. The 5 modules (snapshot, knowledge/retrieval,
# memory, portability, vector_memory) + loop/store import `sqlite3` FROM HERE.
import sqlite3   # re-exported; may be pysqlite3 aliased

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SqliteFeatures:
    driver: str        # "pysqlite3" | "sqlite3"
    version: str       # sqlite library version, e.g. "3.45.1"
    fts5: bool
    json1: bool

def sqlite_features() -> SqliteFeatures: ...   # probes once, memoized
def require_fts5() -> None: ...                # raises RuntimeError with the remedy text if absent
```

- **Remedy text (fixed string, reused):** `"This feature needs SQLite with FTS5. Your runtime's SQLite (<driver> <version>) lacks it. See docs/guides/platforms.md#sqlite."` — used by `require_fts5()` and the doctor line.
- **Doctor line format:** `SQLite: <driver> <version>, FTS5 <✅|❌>, JSON1 <✅|❌>`.
- **The 6 FTS5 consumers** call `require_fts5()` at their store-init (fail-actionable at init, never mid-query — the fail-closed-for-capability rule in AGENTS.md → Shared conventions); where a LIKE fallback genuinely exists, document it per-module and degrade with a warn instead of raising (record the per-module choice in the Execution log — no silent skips).

### C2 — Support matrix (README + `docs/guides/platforms.md`), every row names its proof
`| OS/arch | status | proof |` where proof ∈ {`CI:<job>`, `checklist:<runbook-section>`, `community`}. No row may say "supported" without a proof token.

### Integration points
- **Refactors (class R):** the try/except `import pysqlite3` in `snapshot.py`, `knowledge/retrieval.py`, `memory.py`, `portability.py`, `vector_memory.py`, and the bare `import sqlite3` in `loop/store.py` → all import from `sqlite_compat`.
- **Called by:** `cli_doctor.py` (the SQLite line), the 6 FTS5 modules (`require_fts5`).
- **CI:** adds arm64 jobs to `full.yml` (plan 33); multi-arch release gate in `release.yml`.
- **Owned docs:** `docs/guides/platforms.md`, `docs/roadmap/research/windows-native-audit.md`.
- **Consumed by:** DESKTOP (45) non-mac targets gate on this plan's rungs.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Track A, Session A1 — ARM correctness

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1.1 | `sqlite_features()` helper (driver name, version, fts5 bool via `pragma compile_options`/probe table, json1 bool) in ONE module; `doctor` line ("SQLite: pysqlite3 3.45, FTS5 ✅ JSON1 ✅") | create `src/gideon/sqlite_compat.py` (absorb the repeated try/except import into it; the 5 modules import from here — mechanical refactor, class R), `cli_doctor.py` | six call sites use the shared import; doctor renders the line; unit tests fake both drivers |
| A1.2 | Fail-actionable FTS5 guard: the FTS5 consumers' init paths check `sqlite_features().fts5` once and raise/degrade with the remedy text ("install gideon on Python with FTS5-enabled SQLite — see docs/platforms") instead of failing mid-query; degradation behavior per module recorded (memory FTS recall → LIKE fallback exists? verify per module, document truth, no silent skips) | the six FTS5 modules | a no-FTS5 fixture (monkeypatched probe) produces the actionable error/degradation at init, never a mid-query traceback |
| A1.3 | CI: add `ubuntu-24.04-arm` + `macos-14` jobs to `full.yml` (not PR path — budget); fix what breaks; record arm-specific failures in the Execution log | `.github/workflows/full.yml` | both jobs green; failures root-caused or xfail-annotated with issues |
| V-A1 | Validation: on a real ARM box or arm64 container — fresh install, onboarding, knowledge ingest + FTS search, memory recall, snapshot/restore | — | walkthrough clean; doctor line correct |

### Track A, Session A2 — ARM delivery

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| A2.1 | Multi-arch images release-blocking (release.yml gate: both arches must build + smoke `gideon --version` in each) | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | a failed arm64 build fails the release |
| A2.2 | Wheel/dep audit for `[models]` extra on arm64 linux (faiss-cpu, torch, sentence-transformers availability) — document per-arch reality + graceful degradation in docs | `docs/guides/platforms.md` (new) | table states what works where, verified by install attempts recorded in the log |
| A2.3 | Support matrix in README + platforms doc (linux x86/arm, macOS arm/intel, Windows rungs, each with its proof mechanism: CI job / checklist / community) | `README.md`, `docs/guides/platforms.md` | every row names its proof; no unproven "supported" |
| A2.4 | Pi-class note: RAM floor, extras to skip, swap guidance | `docs/guides/platforms.md` | present; numbers from the A1 validation box |
| V-A2 | Validation: `docker compose up` on an ARM VM from published rc images; state persists; healthchecks green | — | holds |

### Track B, Session B1 — Windows rung 1 (containers)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1.1 | Windows-via-Docker-Desktop guide (WSL2 backend note, volume semantics, localhost ports, .env on Windows paths) | `docs/guides/platforms.md` section | a Windows user reaches the dashboard following it verbatim (owner task 2 validates) |
| B1.2 | Per-release Windows checklist added to the release runbook (compose up, dashboard, one chat, snapshot) | `docs/maintainers/release-runbook.md` | checklist merged; executed once for the current release (owner task 2) |

### Track B, Session B2 — Windows rung 2 (WSL2)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| B2.1 | Browser auto-open fallback: when `xdg-open`/browser launch fails or WSL detected (`/proc/version` contains microsoft), print the URL prominently instead (+ try `wslview` if present) | the auto-open site (locate via `--no-open` flag handling in `cli_server.py`) | WSL fixture prints URL; normal Linux unchanged |
| B2.2 | WSL2 guide: install-in-WSL2 (uv path), systemd-in-WSL2 for `service install` (wsl.conf note), localhost forwarding (automatic), file-system perf note (keep home in ext4, not /mnt/c) | `docs/guides/platforms.md` | guide verbatim-validated (owner task 2) |
| B2.3 | `doctor` WSL awareness: detect WSL, note service/systemd status accordingly | `cli_doctor.py` | WSL fixture shows the note |

### Track B, Session B3 — Windows rung 3 audit (audit ONLY)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| B3.1 | Per-mechanism audit doc against the verified list (Context): options, effort, risk, and the sandbox-degradation policy question stated plainly; go/no-go recommendation + demand-evidence criteria (issue count, Discord signal) | create `docs/roadmap/research/windows-native-audit.md` | every mechanism has options + cost; recommendation explicit; NO implementation code written (soul guardrail — E6 if tempted) |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **ARM validation hardware** (V-A1/V-A2): a Raspberry Pi 4/5, any ARM VPS ($5 tier), or an arm64 cloud VM for an hour — your pick; the walkthroughs are scripted.
2. **Windows validation** (B1/B2): access to one Windows 11 machine (yours or borrowed) for two ~30-min checklist runs per release cycle until CI can cover it.
3. **Decide the rung-3 go/no-go** when B3.1's audit lands (the sandbox-degradation policy is an owner-level security posture call).

## Risks & open questions

- **Stdlib-SQLite FTS5 variance** on niche distros is the real ARM risk — A1.2 converts silent breakage into actionable errors, which is the honest floor; shipping an arm64 pysqlite3 build is the later nicety (DISCOVERY-file it if variance shows up in the wild).
- **Open:** whether `loop/store.py` (plain `import sqlite3`, no fallback) should join `sqlite_compat` — yes in A1.1's refactor sweep; flagged here so the executor doesn't treat it as out-of-scope.

## Execution log

- **PR-1 DONE — one SQLite binding + capability probe.** Added `src/gideon/sqlite_compat.py`:
  the driver choice (`pysqlite3` when the wheel is present, else stdlib `sqlite3`) is now made ONCE,
  and `probe()` (memoized) reports `{driver, version, fts5, json1}` against an in-memory connection.
  The five `try/except pysqlite3` blocks (snapshot.py, knowledge/retrieval.py, memory.py,
  portability.py, vector_memory.py) AND `loop/store.py`'s bare `import sqlite3` (the "Open" item the
  plan flagged — folded in, as directed) now all `from gideon.sqlite_compat import sqlite3`, so
  a test patching SQLite has one bind point instead of seven (clean break — the dual import paths are
  deleted, not shimmed). `cli_doctor.py` renders `SQLite: <driver> <version>, FTS5 <✅|❌>, JSON1
  <✅|❌>` with a `pip install pysqlite3-binary` fix hint when FTS5 is absent. **Gates:** `make lint`
  clean (698 source files — new module picked up); `tests/test_sqlite_compat.py` (8: all-six-consumers
  share one binding, real-driver version/FTS5/JSON1 probe agreeing with a direct check, memoization,
  faked full + stripped drivers, connect-blows-up→all-absent) + the touched-module suites
  (durability_shards / memory_smoke / vector_memory) = 88 passed. CHANGELOG `### Added` (the doctor
  line is user-visible). Scope: PR-1 only — the arm64 build matrix (PR-4) + Windows guides (PR-6/7)
  are later atoms.
- **PR-1 follow-up (amended):** the full-suite `test` job surfaced two consequences of the
  consolidation the file-scoped run missed. (1) `knowledge/store.py` also carried the `try/except
  pysqlite3` and was folded into `sqlite_compat` too (clean break — no straggler). (2)
  `test_knowledge.py::TestPysqlite3Fallback` evicts `pysqlite3` + reimports a consumer to prove the
  stdlib fallback; the driver choice now lives in `sqlite_compat`, so the helper must ALSO evict
  `gideon.sqlite_compat` (else the cached pysqlite3 binding defeats the fallback). Verified
  under a simulated pysqlite3-present environment (the CI condition): all three modules fall back to
  stdlib and `sqlite_compat` is restored afterward.
- **PR-8 DONE — native-Windows rung-3 audit (audit ONLY, zero code).** Wrote
  `docs/roadmap/research/windows-native-audit.md`. Honors the soul guardrail: the doc adds NO
  implementation code — it costs a native `pip install gideon` on Windows PowerShell (no WSL2,
  no Docker) and recommends against it. Each of the six mechanisms is grounded in a verified as-built
  citation and given options+effort+risk+verdict: (1) process reaping — `start_new_session=True` +
  `os.killpg` across 4 spawn / 5 kill sites (`acp/transport.py:366`/`:456`, escaped-child PPID walk
  `:109-208`) → **Job Objects** (M) beat `taskkill /T` (which reintroduces the escaped-child bug the
  POSIX code closes); (2) file perms — `chmod 0o600` + `_enforce_perms` on `mode & 0o077`
  (`llm/credentials.py:96`/`:288-297`, ~30 secret sites) → **`icacls`/ACL seam** (M) — the load-bearing
  risk, because `os.chmod` on NTFS only toggles read-only so the owner-only guarantee **silently**
  fails; (3) symlinks — 3 create sites (`frontend.py:71`/`:98`, `resilience/fixes.py:137`) →
  **junction-or-copy fallback** (S, cheapest); (4) PTY — module-load POSIX imports
  (`terminal.py:4-12`) + `pty.openpty()` `:273` → **disable the page** (S) or pywinpty (M); (5) service
  — `service/common.py:63-74` dispatch with no `Platform.WINDOWS` → **Task Scheduler** (S–M, fits the
  personal-agent model; a Windows Service fights the gateway's user-session + browser-open); (6) sandbox
  — `detect_backend()` (`sandbox.py:596-618`) + `_spawn_exec_shim.py:54-85` degradation → **isolation =
  none, ceilings via Job Object limits, agent command execution off-by-default with a loud
  acknowledgement** — the decisive posture question, and an owner-level call. **Verdict: NO-GO now** —
  the two blocking mechanisms (perms §2, sandbox §6) silently weaken security guarantees, are the most
  expensive to validate (a real Windows host, not CI mocks), and a finished port would still be weaker
  than the WSL2 path (rungs 1–2) that runs the real Linux code intact. Demand-evidence gate to flip to
  go: ≥10 distinct native-Windows-only issues, a top-5 sustained community theme, requests that
  converge on an environment WSL2/Docker genuinely cannot serve, and owner ratification of the §6
  posture. **Rung-2.5 finding (recorded, NOT fixed here — out of this rung's audit-only scope):** the
  unguarded method-local `import resource` at `gateway.py:3471` `ImportError`s at gateway **boot** on
  native Windows, so even "run it and observe" fails before start; guarding it (as
  `_spawn_exec_shim.py:54-57` already does) is a future one-line-class hardening, not a port. **Gate:**
  doc-only change — `make lint` clean; `python3 -c 'json.load(dag.json)'` parses (598 atoms). No source
  touched, so no pytest/web run applies.
- [2026-08-10][PR-3 / A1.3] DONE: arm64 CI jobs on the non-PR path. Extended `full.yml`'s `matrix` job with two `include` entries — `ubuntu-24.04-arm` and `macos-14`, each on Python 3.13 — rather than crossing arm into the full grid: A1.3 scopes arm to the non-PR path explicitly "for budget", so two extra jobs prove the arch while four would double the arm cost for no new signal. The job already carried the seam comment ("ARM runners are added by PLATFORM-REACH — this job is the seam it extends"), so no structural change was needed: same steps, same `fail-fast: false`, and the no-global-`GIDEON_HOME` contract preserved (a global value defeats the `Path.home()`/default-`.gideon` tests). Verified the matrix expands to 6 jobs (4 x86 + the 2 arm) by parsing the workflow and computing the product+include. NOT claimed green: arm greenness is only provable once CI actually runs these runners on `main`/nightly — the done-when's "root-caused or xfail-annotated" half applies to whatever the first arm run surfaces, and any arm-specific failure gets recorded here. Out of scope (separate atoms): the `[models]`-extra arm wheel audit (A2.2/PR-5) and the release.yml multi-arch smoke gate (A2.1/PR-4).
- [2026-08-10][PR-4 / A2.1] DONE: multi-arch images are release-BLOCKING. `release.yml`'s `images` job already built `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`, but a manifest that merely BUILDS can still ship an arch that cannot start — so this adds a per-arch smoke that runs INSIDE each container: `docker pull --platform linux/<arch>` then `docker run --platform linux/<arch> --entrypoint '' … sh -lc "<smoke>"` for amd64 and arm64 (arm64 executes under the QEMU emulation the job already sets up). DEVIATION from the done-when's literal "smoke `gideon --version` in each": the smoke is now a per-image matrix field, because the two images differ — `gateway` ships the CLI (`gideon --version`, verified at `cli.py:196`, prints `gideon 0.1.3`) but `web` is `nginx:1.27-alpine` with no such binary, so it proves `nginx -v` instead. Hardcoding `gideon --version` for both would have failed every release on the web image. `--entrypoint ''` bypasses tini/nginx-entrypoint so the smoke runs instead of starting the service. Gate proven by parsing the workflow: the smoke step is in `images`, and `notes` (the GitHub Release) `needs: [build, pypi, images]` — so a failed arm64 build OR smoke fails `images` and blocks the release.
- [2026-08-10][PR-5 / A2.2+A2.3] DONE: support matrix with real proof tokens + `[models]` per-arch reality. `docs/guides/platforms.md` already existed (created by EI-11 security docs) and already had a matrix, but its Proof column was prose ("CI test + release smoke") — not the required `CI:<job>`/`checklist:<section>`/`community` tokens — so no row was actually falsifiable. Rewrote it so every row names something you can re-run: the arm64 rows now cite `CI:full/matrix (ubuntu-24.04-arm)` + `CI:release/images smoke (linux/arm64)`, which only became true via A1.3 (PR-3) and A2.1 (PR-4); verified those job ids/runners exist by parsing both workflows. Mirrored the matrix into README with the token legend. `[models]` per-arch table is evidenced from the committed `uv.lock` rather than a claim: faiss-cpu ships `macosx_14_0_arm64` + `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` + `musllinux_1_2_aarch64` (so Alpine works), torch ships `macosx_14_0_arm64` + `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` (CPU, no CUDA on arm), and sentence-transformers is `py3-none-any` (arch-independent) — so the extra installs from wheels on every arch we claim, no compiler needed; the doc includes the one-liner to re-derive that from the lock. Added the Pi-class RAM floor (<2GB skip the extra; 2-4GB add swap, with the fallocate recipe; >=4GB nothing) and the OOM-at-ingest-means-model-load diagnostic. DEVIATION from "verified by recorded install attempts": no arm64 box is available to this run, so the evidence is the resolver's own wheel record in `uv.lock` (re-derivable, and it tracks version bumps) instead of a transcript. DISCOVERY + honesty fix: the pre-existing matrix claimed Windows-via-Docker-Desktop "supported" with no walkthrough anywhere in docs/ (only a research doc) — that is exactly the unproven-'supported' the contract forbids, so the row is now `unverified` and points at B1.1 (atom PR-6) which owns writing that guide. macOS Intel likewise demoted to `community` (no Intel runner in CI).
