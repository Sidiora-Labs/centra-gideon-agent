# Plan: Artifacts Evolution — From a Files Tab to a First-Class Creative Library

**Status:** DESIGNED — created 2026-07-26 (roadmap rev 13; owner ask: sibling-platform gap analysis round 2)
**Created:** 2026-07-26
**Wave:** 2 (S1: the split + store hardening; S2: the library surface) + 3 (S3: iterate-with-agent + diffs + chat references)
**Depends on:** nothing hard for S1-2 (builds on the shipped `artifacts/` package, WidgetFrame/ReactWidgetFrame, and the Files page). S3 has a hard dep on **INVESTIGATE-ANYWHERE (60)** — the iterate panel consumes its primitive (registers an `artifact` resolver against plan 60's registry; reuse, don't duplicate). Coordinates with DESIGN-SYSTEM-CONSISTENCY (51, shipped — the library grid uses the primitives/tokens), FLUID-MOTION (52 — grid/preview motion inherits its tiers when it lands), WORKFLOWS-V2 program (loop/cron provenance already flows in via `source`; no engine coupling), APP-PLATFORM-EVOLUTION (48 — apps read artifacts only via existing SDK/API surfaces).
**Scope:** owner decision: artifacts were coupled to the Files page for **navigational similarity only** — split them into their OWN surface and evolve toward what the sibling ecosystem proved: stable identity, version history + revert, a library with live previews, and "iterate with agent." Code recon (below) shows the *store* is already first-class — the real gaps are the surface and the iterate loop. **S1 — the split + store hardening:** artifacts get their own top-level route + nav entry (`#/artifacts`), the Files page keeps raw workspace files only, deep-links migrate, and the `artifact_save` tool gains server-backed list-before-save dedup (a similar-artifact hint, not just skill prose). **S2 — the library surface:** a grid with LIVE sandboxed preview thumbnails (WidgetFrame/ReactWidgetFrame scaled down, theme-token-injected, lazily mounted), search/filter/collections, and the version timeline + revert promoted into the library detail. **S3 (Wave 3) — iterate with agent:** a side chat panel beside an open artifact seeded with its content via plan 60's primitive, version-to-version diff, and `@`-artifact references in chat that resolve to the library. **Soul guardrails:** (1) **one artifact store** — the existing `artifacts/` package IS the entity; this plan never forks a second store or a parallel "library" model; (2) **previews are sandboxed exactly like chat widgets** — same `sandbox="allow-scripts"` isolation, same srcdoc/theme contract, scaled not re-implemented; (3) **versions are immutable, identity is the slug** — nothing here may change slug derivation (`widgetSlug.ts`'s FNV scheme is load-bearing: changing it orphans every saved chat widget). Class **B** where it adds persisted metadata (the `collection` field on `meta.json`) — pre-LIFECYCLE-DOCTRINE, so it lands as a **plain clean break under the pre-1.0 banner** (tolerant reads, no gate/migration; CHANGELOG entry + snapshot advice in release notes).

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-26 — be honest about what exists vs missing)

**Already built (far more than the "evolve toward" list assumed — the store IS the entity):**
- **A real artifact entity with stable identity, versions, revert, events, provenance.** `src/gideon/artifacts/` — `models.py` (246 lines): `Artifact` dataclass with `slug` (URL-safe, regex-validated, the on-disk dir name — path-traversal-proofed), monotonic `version`, `kind` ∈ {widget, html, react, markdown, svg, json, text, infographic, document, image}, `source` ∈ {chat, cron, subagent, manual, import} (provenance!), `tags`, `project_id`, `events: list[ArtifactEvent]` (created/edited/iterated/referenced/reverted, each carrying `by` + `session_id` — the chat deep-link), caps (50 versions FIFO-pruned, 1MiB text / 16MiB binary bodies). `provider.py`: `ArtifactProvider` ABC (list/get/create/update/revert/create_binary/update_binary/raw_bytes/find_by_source_path) behind `registry.py`; `native.py` (752 lines): on-disk under `config_dir()/artifacts/<slug>/` (`meta.json` + `current.*` + `versions/vN.*`), coarse-locked, atomic writes; **server-side revert** (kind-agnostic, restores vN as a NEW current version — never round-trips content through the client).
- **A full REST surface.** `handlers.py`: GET/POST `/api/artifacts`, GET/PATCH/DELETE `/{slug}`, `/{slug}/raw` (binary, per-version Content-Type from the on-disk extension), `/{slug}/regenerate` (image re-gen), `/{slug}/versions[/{version}]`, `/{slug}/events` (GET + POST record). Create already **dedups by `source_path`** (`handlers.py:113-116` — re-saving a file-backed artifact bumps the existing one via `find_by_source_path`).
- **Agent tools.** `mcp_artifacts.py`: `artifact_save/get/update/list/versions/delete` + image/video generate, dispatched against the native provider, project-scoped (`_current_project_id`), SEL-audited. **Dedup today is skill-prose-only:** the bundled `artifacts` skill (`skills/bundled/artifacts/SKILL.md`) instructs "Always `artifact_list` before `artifact_save`" — but `artifact_save` itself (`mcp_artifacts.py:346`) creates unconditionally; a name collision silently mints `-2` slugs via `_unique_slug` (`native.py:440-444`). That's the list-before-save gap.
- **Chat-side identity + save.** `web/src/ui/widget/widgetSlug.ts` — deterministic slug from `(messageTs, widgetIndex)` (two 32-bit FNV-1a passes; the comment marks the scheme as change-forbidden); `WidgetFrame.tsx:95-120` — save-as-artifact bookmark that reconciles across refresh, plus the C32 living-view bridge (a saved widget names its slug so the agent can `artifact_update` it in place). `widgetSrcdoc.ts` — theme-token injection (NE `--color-*` tokens + short aliases read live from the host, sanitized) into the sandboxed srcdoc; `ReactWidgetFrame.tsx` — the same for `kind:react` (blob-iframe, `sandbox="allow-scripts"`).
- **The Files-page viewer.** `web/src/pages/files/FilesSection.tsx` — Artifacts is ONE TAB in the Files top-bar (comment: "Unified Files + Artifacts page"); deep-link `#/files/<slug>` opens it. `artifacts/ArtifactList.tsx` (85 lines — a filter rail: text + kind chips) and `ArtifactViewer.tsx` (274 lines — render + edit/snapshot + **version picker + revert UI already working** + events timeline + download). `api.ts` has the full typed client (`artifacts`, `artifact`, `updateArtifact`, `artifactVersions`, `artifactVersion`, …).
- **Design cockpit precedent for live grids:** `pages/loops/DesignCockpitPage.tsx:598-625` — CanvasView renders multiple `kind:react` artifacts live via `ReactWidgetFrame`, ordered, tag-scoped (`loop:{id}`) — proof the "many live sandboxed previews on one page" pattern performs.

**Actually missing (the honest gap list this plan closes):**
1. **No standalone surface.** Artifacts live behind a Files tab; no top-level nav entry, no `#/artifacts` route (the skill's own prose "each lives at `/artifacts/<slug>`" is aspirational — the real deep-link is `#/files/<slug>`). No grid, no live thumbnails (the rail is text rows), no collections (tags exist but no curated grouping), no cross-cutting library view of images+widgets+docs together.
2. **No enforced dedup on save.** Skill prose only; the tool happily creates `sales-dashboard-2`.
3. **No iterate-with-agent.** ArtifactViewer's edit is a raw content textarea; "iterate" means going back to a chat and naming the slug. No side-by-side artifact+chat, no seeded context.
4. **No version diff.** The viewer shows one version at a time; no A/B comparison.
5. **No chat references.** The composer's `@` menu reaches knowledge items (`chat_runner.py:718::_inject_knowledge_content`) but not artifacts.

**Sibling precedent — KiroGideon's live-pointer model:** file-backed artifacts share an on-disk pointer with the file viewer; a deliberate Snapshot action + a `live_dirty` drift flag distinguish "the file moved on" from "the saved version." **Verdict: ALREADY ADOPTED — preserve it.** Gideon independently has the identical mechanism: `source_path` (the workspace file is the live source of truth, `native.py:157-210` read/write-through), `live_dirty` computed per-read (`models.py` — live content differs from the latest snapshot; never persisted), the explicit Snapshot button (`ArtifactViewer.tsx:86-90`), and the drift dot in the rail (`ArtifactList.tsx` warning dot). This plan keeps the model exactly as-is and carries it into the library UI (drift badge on file-backed cards); no adopt-or-reject decision remains open.

## Design

- **S1 — the entity split + store hardening.** (a) **Route split:** `#/artifacts` becomes a top-level route + nav entry ("Artifacts", `FileCode` icon); `FilesSection` drops the `ARTIFACTS_TAB` and reverts to raw file roots only (Workspace/Home/Outbox); old `#/files/<slug>` deep-links redirect to `#/artifacts/<slug>` (clean break: the redirect is a one-line hash rewrite kept because external references — artifact events' `session_id` chat links, the skill prose — point at slugs, not because we keep dual paths; the Files-tab code is deleted in the same change). Skill/docs prose updates to the real route. (b) **List-before-save dedup, enforced server-side:** `artifact_save` without an explicit `slug` first checks for likely duplicates (same normalized name → same base slug; same kind + high name similarity) and, on a hit, returns a **structured refusal-with-hint** ("artifact `sales-dashboard` (v4, updated 2h ago) looks like this; pass `slug` to update it, or `force:true` to create anew") instead of silently minting `-2`. Explicit `slug` and `force` keep full power; the REST create path gains the same check behind a `?force=` escape. The skill prose stays (it teaches the flow) but the tool no longer depends on the model's obedience. (c) **`collection` field** on `Artifact` (single string, "" = none — the curated grouping the grid needs; tags remain free-form labels): tolerant reads, wired through models/provider/handlers/tools/api.ts.
- **S2 — the library surface.** `web/src/pages/artifacts/` — a **grid of live preview cards**: each card mounts the real renderer (WidgetFrame srcdoc pipeline for widget/html/svg/infographic/document; ReactWidgetFrame for react; markdown/text/json as styled excerpts; `<img>` off `/raw` for images) inside a fixed-aspect, `pointer-events:none`, CSS-scaled container — theme-token-injected exactly like chat (reuse `widgetSrcdoc.ts`/`readThemeVars`, zero new sandbox code). Previews mount **lazily** (IntersectionObserver; placeholder = kind icon tile) and cap concurrent live iframes (~12, LRU-unmount off-screen) so a 200-artifact library stays smooth — the DesignCockpit CanvasView proves the per-frame cost. Toolbar: text search (name/slug/description/tags — the existing client-side filter promoted), kind chips (as today), source filter (chat/cron/subagent/manual/import — surfacing provenance), collection picker + assign, sort (updated/created/name). **Detail view** = today's ArtifactViewer relocated (render + edit + snapshot + version timeline + revert + events + download), now full-page with the version rail always visible. Nothing about versions/revert is rebuilt — it ships today and moves house.
- **S3 (Wave 3) — iterate with agent.** (a) **The iterate panel:** an "Iterate with agent" action on the detail view opens a side chat panel (split view: artifact left, chat right) — implemented as plan 60's primitive: an `artifact` resolver registered against INVESTIGATE-ANYWHERE's registry (envelope = name/kind/version + current content, fenced; suggested task mode **`agent`** here, not `ask` — iteration means the agent may call `artifact_update` on THIS slug; the opening prompt names the slug so the C32 living-view bridge refreshes the preview in place as versions land). The panel is `ChatEmbed` (appSdk) pointed at the created session — no new chat surface. The preview re-renders on each `artifact_update` (poll the version, or the existing events feed). (b) **Version diff:** a Compare mode in the version rail — two-version picker → unified text diff for text kinds (client-side, no new endpoint: both bodies come from `/versions/{n}`), side-by-side rendered previews for visual kinds, before/after for images. (c) **Chat references:** the composer's `@` menu gains an Artifacts section; selection stamps `meta.artifacts: [slug]` and a `_inject_artifact_content` (beside `_inject_knowledge_content`, same fenced-labelled-block pattern, records a `referenced` event) resolves current content at turn time — chat mentions resolve to the library, live.
- **What this is NOT:** not a second store (the `artifacts/` package is untouched in shape); not a publishing/sharing system (SESSION-MANAGEMENT S3's share-as-artifact and any public publishing stay out of scope); not a widget-runtime change (srcdoc/sandbox/theme contracts are consumed, never modified).

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE](INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md))

### C1 — Model addition (`artifacts/models.py`; clean break, tolerant reads)
```python
# NEW Artifact field (persisted in meta.json; old meta without it reads as ""):
collection: str = ""   # single curated grouping; "" = uncollected. Tags stay free-form.
```
Wired through `to_dict`/`from_dict`, provider `list(collection=...)` filter, PATCH allowlist in `handlers.py::api_artifact_update`, `api.ts` `Artifact` interface. Collections are emergent (the set = distinct non-empty values — no separate collections store).

### C2 — Save dedup (provider + tool + REST; §2.2 error envelope)
```python
# artifacts/native.py (provider-level, so every caller gets it):
def find_similar(self, *, name: str, kind: str) -> Artifact | None: ...
  # exact base-slug match first (slugify(name) == existing slug), then
  # same-kind normalized-name equality; deterministic, no LLM.

# mcp_artifacts.py artifact_save, when no explicit slug and not force:
#   similar found → return structured hint text (slug, version, updated_at,
#   "pass slug=... to update, or force=true to create") — NO create. SEL outcome="deduped".
# handlers.py api_artifacts_create: same check; 409 {"error":{"code":"similar_artifact_exists",
#   "message":..., }} + hint payload, bypass via ?force=1 or explicit slug.
```
`source_path` dedup (`handlers.py:113`) is untouched — it already updates-in-place.

### C3 — Routes + library surface (frontend)
```
#/artifacts                    → ArtifactsSection (grid; query: ?q=&kind=&source=&collection=&sort=)
#/artifacts/<slug>             → detail (viewer + versions + events); ?v=N deep-links a version
#/files/<slug>  (legacy)       → hash-rewrite redirect to #/artifacts/<slug>
```
New components: `web/src/pages/artifacts/ArtifactsSection.tsx`, `ArtifactGrid.tsx`, `ArtifactCard.tsx` (lazy live preview: srcdoc via the existing `widgetSrcdoc.ts` builders, `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, CSS `transform: scale()`, `pointer-events:none`, IntersectionObserver mount + LRU cap), relocated `ArtifactViewer.tsx`. `pages/files/artifacts/` is deleted (clean break).

### C4 — Iterate + references (S3; consumes plan 60's registry — never a second launcher)
```python
# artifacts side (registered at boot, per plan 60 C1):
register_investigate_resolver("artifact", _resolve_artifact)
#   → InvestigateContext(kind="artifact", id=slug, snapshot=current content (capped),
#       suggested_task_mode="agent", back_link=f"#/artifacts/{slug}",
#       opening_prompt=f"Iterate on artifact `{slug}` (use artifact_update)...")
# chat side:
#   composer @-menu → meta.artifacts: [slug, ...]
def _inject_artifact_content(state, session, message) -> str: ...
#   (chat_runner.py, beside _inject_knowledge_content; fenced labelled block;
#    records a 'referenced' ArtifactEvent with session_id)
```

### Integration points
- **Calls:** the `artifacts/` package (provider/registry/handlers — extended, not forked), `widgetSrcdoc.ts`/`readThemeVars`/`ReactWidgetFrame` (preview reuse), plan 60's `register_investigate_resolver` + `ChatEmbed` (S3), `fence_untrusted` via the injection pattern (S3c), SEL (`artifact_*` audit already wired; dedup adds `outcome="deduped"`).
- **Called by:** chat WidgetFrame save/living-view (unchanged — same slugs, same API), DesignCockpit canvas (unchanged — tag-scoped list), Projects linked view (`/api/projects/{id}/linked` artifacts — unchanged), the nav shell (new route).
- **Storage owned:** `config_dir()/artifacts/` (existing; +`collection` in meta.json). No new stores.
- **Deliberately NOT touched:** `widgetSlug.ts` slug derivation (load-bearing), version snapshot format (`versions/vN.*`), the srcdoc/sandbox contract, `MAX_VERSIONS`/body caps, attention-path contracts.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under [EXECUTION-PROTOCOL](EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md))

### Session 1 — Entity split + store hardening

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | `collection` field: model + provider list filter + PATCH allowlist + tools (`artifact_update` collection arg, `artifact_list` filter) + api.ts type; tolerant read test (old meta.json loads with `""`) | `src/gideon/artifacts/models.py`, `native.py`, `provider.py`, `handlers.py`, `mcp_artifacts.py`, `web/src/lib/api.ts` | round-trips through REST + tool; pre-existing artifact dirs load clean |
| T1.2 | Server-backed dedup: `find_similar` on the provider + the `artifact_save` refusal-with-hint (+ `force`) + REST 409 `similar_artifact_exists` (+ `?force=1`); `source_path` path untouched; SEL `outcome="deduped"` | `native.py`, `mcp_artifacts.py`, `handlers.py`, tests | saving "Sales Dashboard" twice without slug/force yields the hint (tool) / 409 (REST), and NO `-2` slug exists on disk |
| T1.3 | Route split: `#/artifacts[/<slug>]` top-level route + nav entry; `FilesSection` drops the artifacts tab (delete `pages/files/artifacts/` after relocation); `#/files/<slug>` hash-redirect; skill/docs prose updated to the real route | `web/src/app/App.tsx`, nav shell, `web/src/pages/files/FilesSection.tsx`, `web/src/pages/artifacts/` (new home for the relocated viewer), `skills/bundled/artifacts/SKILL.md` | Files shows only file roots; an old `#/files/<slug>` link lands on `#/artifacts/<slug>`; viewer works at its new home byte-equivalent in behavior |
| V1 | Validation as a user: save widgets from chat (dedup hint exercised), navigate the new route, revert a version, confirm chat living-view still refreshes a saved widget; full local gate | — | holds |

### Session 2 — The library surface

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | `ArtifactCard` live preview: srcdoc-per-kind (widget/html/svg/infographic/document via `widgetSrcdoc`, react via ReactWidgetFrame's builder, markdown/text/json excerpt, image via `/raw`), scaled + inert + lazy (IntersectionObserver) + LRU iframe cap (~12) | `web/src/pages/artifacts/ArtifactCard.tsx`, `ArtifactGrid.tsx` | a mixed-kind library renders live, theme-correct previews; off-screen cards hold placeholders; theme switch re-renders visible cards |
| T2.2 | Grid toolbar: search + kind/source chips + collection picker/assign + sort; URL-query-backed (shareable filter state) | `ArtifactsSection.tsx` | filter state round-trips the URL; assigning a collection from the card menu persists |
| T2.3 | Detail view polish: full-page viewer with always-visible version rail + events timeline + `?v=N` deep-link; drift badge (`live_dirty`) on file-backed cards + detail | `pages/artifacts/` detail components | version deep-link opens the immutable snapshot; the drift badge matches the Files-era behavior |
| T2.4 | Perf proof: 200-artifact seeded fixture — grid scroll stays smooth (measure; no more than the iframe cap live), list endpoint stays content-free (verify `list` omits `content` end-to-end) | fixture + a perf note in the PR | measured, no jank; no content in list payloads |
| V2 | Validation as a user: browse/search/collect a real library incl. images + react widgets; token-lint/theme pass; web typecheck/test/build | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Iterate with agent + diff + references (Wave 3; needs plan 60 landed)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | `artifact` investigate resolver (envelope per C4: content capped + fenced downstream, task mode `agent`, back-link, slug-naming opening prompt) registered against plan 60's registry | `artifacts/` boot registration, tests | "Iterate with agent" produces a session whose first turn carries the fenced artifact content |
| T3.2 | The split-view iterate panel: detail view + `ChatEmbed` side panel on the investigate-created session; preview refreshes when `artifact_update` lands a new version (events/version poll) | `pages/artifacts/` detail, using `appSdk.ChatEmbed` | ask the agent to change the widget → new version appears in the rail AND the preview updates without reload |
| T3.3 | Version diff: Compare mode — unified text diff (text kinds, client-side over two `/versions/{n}` bodies), side-by-side previews (visual kinds), before/after (image) | version rail components | pick v3 vs v7 → correct diff per kind |
| T3.4 | Chat `@`-artifact references: composer menu section + `meta.artifacts` + `_inject_artifact_content` (fenced, labelled, `referenced` event recorded) | `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` composer, `dashboard/chat_runner.py`, tests | `@sales-dashboard` in chat grounds the reply in the current version; the artifact's events show `referenced` with the session id |
| V3 | Validation as a user: full loop — create in chat → find in library → iterate in the panel → diff versions → revert → reference from a new chat; full local gate | — | holds |

## Owner tasks (real world)
1. **Rule on the dedup default** — server-refuses-with-hint (proposed) vs hint-but-create. The refusal changes agent behavior on every save; dogfood it a week and confirm it doesn't annoy legitimate "another dashboard, same name" flows (the `force` escape is the pressure valve).
2. **Confirm S3's `agent` task mode** for the iterate panel (it deliberately diverges from plan 60's `ask` default — iteration requires writes to that one slug). If this feels too open, the fallback is `ask` + a one-click escalate.
3. **Name the nav position** — Artifacts as a top-level rail entry displaces nothing, but the rail is finite; confirm placement (proposed: beside Files).

## Risks & open questions
- **Live-preview iframe cost:** dozens of sandboxed iframes can hurt. Mitigated by lazy mount + LRU cap + `pointer-events:none` (no interactivity cost) — T2.4 measures against a 200-artifact fixture before ship; the fallback is static-thumbnail-until-hover, decided by measurement, not taste.
- **Dedup false positives:** deterministic name/slug matching only (no LLM, no fuzzy embeddings) keeps it predictable; the hint always includes the exact escape (`slug`/`force`). A false positive costs one retry, a silent duplicate costs a polluted library — the asymmetry favors refusing.
- **Route-split fallout:** anything hardcoding `#/files/<slug>` (chat event deep-links are built FE-side; grep all of `web/src` + docs) must move in the same change — the redirect is a safety net for *persisted* references (old sessions' rendered links), not an excuse to leave callers on the old route.
- **S3 sequencing:** if plan 60 slips, S3 must NOT hand-roll a seeded-chat variant (that's exactly the duplication the owner consolidated); S3 waits — record the stop point in the execution log per the split-plan convention.
- **Open:** whether collections should be orderable/nested — deferred; flat single-collection ships first (tags already cover cross-cutting), DISCOVERY-file if real use demands hierarchy.
