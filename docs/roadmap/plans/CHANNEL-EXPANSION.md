# CHANNEL-EXPANSION

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/CE.md`](../atomic/CE.md) as 9 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Channel Expansion — Core Channels Beyond the Slack Proof of Concept

**Status:** DESIGNED — deepened 2026-07-18 with code recon (initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18; owner: "first wave = few core channels most popular in market beyond the slack proof of concept")
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Wave:** 1 (S1-3: sender-trust seam + Telegram) + 2 (S4-8: Discord, email, author ramp)
**Depends on:** nothing hard — the seams are proven vendor-blind. EXTERNAL-ACCESS §3's sender-trust research is absorbed here early. Coordinates with INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION (channel DM as a rules-selectable delivery target; pairing prompts become inbox items post-plan-42) and PROVIDER-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION (do not add residue while it removes some).
**Scope:** channels are the mobile story, the retention mechanism, and the viral demo. This plan adds the trust substrate + Telegram, Discord, and email first-party apps + the channel-author ramp. **Soul guardrail:** every channel is an app bundle against the existing seams — zero vendor code enters core. First-party channels use **official APIs only** (no reverse-engineered protocols; WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage are community-tier by explicit risk policy). Dependency discipline: prefer wire-protocol implementations over vendor SDKs (httpx + websockets are already core deps; a vendor SDK enters an app only with a task line naming it).

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18)

- **The inbound seam** (`channel_transports/base.py`): `ChannelTransportProvider` ABC — `name`, `display_name`, `connect/disconnect`, `send(OutboundMessage)`, `receive() -> AsyncIterator[ChannelMessage]`, `start_inbound(services)/stop_inbound`, `health()`, `test()`, `capabilities() -> ChannelCapabilities`, `info()`. Dataclasses `OutboundMessage`/`ChannelMessage`/`ChannelCapabilities` exist.
- **The outbound seam** (`channel_delivery.py`): 18-method `ChannelDelivery` protocol incl. `open_dm`, `deliver_text/rich/cron_result/notification/chat_mirror/subagent_reply`, `resolve_user_name/profile`, `channel_info`, `list_reply_channels`, `is_tracked_channel`, `build_thread_link`, `upload_attachment`, streaming (`start_stream/append_stream_task/stop_stream`), `request_approval`.
- **Trust today is app-local:** `apps/slack-channel/slack_runtime/allowlist.py` — `persist_allowed_user`, `persist_tracking_channel`, owner Allow/Deny prompt flows, dashboard-link send. The generic transport has **no trust vocabulary** — the gap this plan's S1 closes.
- **Linking:** `session_map.py` provides the generic thread↔session map (`set/get`, provider+cwd fields, thread index); channel apps call through it.
- **SDK surface:** `sdk/channel.py` already re-exports the transport/delivery/GatewayServices/security/session surfaces apps need — trust joins these exports.

## Design

### S1 — Sender trust as a core seam (`src/gideon/channel_trust.py`)

- **Store:** `~/.gideon/entity_settings/channel_trust.json` (atomic_write): per provider — `allowed_senders {id: {name, added_at, via: owner|pairing}}`, `tracked_channels {id: {name, added_at}}`, `pairing {code_hash, expires_at, created_at}` (single active code per provider, single-use, TTL 10 min, 8-digit numeric, **hash stored** — sha256), `policies {dm: pairing|owner_only|open, group: tracked_only|off}` (defaults: `dm=pairing`, `group=tracked_only`).
- **API (sdk-exported):** `is_allowed_sender(provider, sender_id)`, `allow_sender/deny_sender`, `is_tracked_channel`, `track/untrack`, `create_pairing_code(provider) -> code` (returned once), `redeem_pairing_code(provider, sender_id, code) -> bool` (constant-time hash compare; consumes on success), `trust_policies(provider)`.
- **Unknown-sender flow (transport-side contract, documented + conformance-tested):** DM from non-allowed sender → if text matches active code: redeem → allow + owner notification "paired: <name>"; else → canned pairing-needed reply (rate-limited: once per sender per 24h, tracked in-store) + owner notification with Allow/Deny meta-actions (existing notification action pattern; becomes inbox `agent_request` after plan 42). **Non-owner content is data:** group/tracked-channel content from non-owner senders passes `fence_untrusted(text, source="channel:<provider>:<sender>")` before entering any session context — helper `fence_channel_content()` exported via sdk so transports can't hand-roll it.
- **Slack migration:** `allowlist.py` persist/query functions become adapters over the seam (its prompt UX unchanged); its JSON store migrates via a loud one-time `migrate_to_core_trust()` (the `migrate_from_core` precedent, reversed). SEL events: `sender_paired`, `sender_denied`, `pairing_code_created`.

### S2-3 — Telegram (`apps/telegram-channel`) — first: best official bot API

- **No SDK:** raw Bot API over `httpx` (core dep). Inbound = long-poll `getUpdates` loop in `start_inbound` (offset-tracked, 50s timeout, backoff on failure); webhook mode deferred to EXTERNAL-ACCESS. Outbound `SendMessage`/`editMessageText`; **streaming = throttled edits** (≥1.1s between edits, final flush on `stop_stream`); `sendDocument`/`sendPhoto` for `upload_attachment`; MarkdownV2 with a proper escaper (its own module + table-driven tests — Telegram escaping is the classic footgun); `request_approval` = inline keyboard (Approve/Deny callback_query → the same approval answer path Slack uses); `build_thread_link` = `https://t.me/...` deep link. DMs pair via the trust seam; groups require `tracked_channels` (bot privacy mode documented). Capabilities: streaming=edit-based, rich=limited, threads=reply-chains (+forum topics where enabled).
- App layout mirrors slack-channel: `transport.py`, `delivery.py`, `format.py` (escaper), `api.py` (thin Bot API client), `settings.py` (ProviderSettings: token via credential store key `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`), `cli_setup.py`/`cli_doctor.py` (plan 32 seams), `test_*.py` with a fake Bot API (httpx MockTransport).

### S4-5 — Discord (`apps/discord-channel`)

- Needs the Gateway WS for events: minimal client over `websockets` (core dep) — identify (intents: guilds, guild_messages, direct_messages, message_content), heartbeat/ack, resume on reconnect, dispatch MESSAGE_CREATE/INTERACTION_CREATE; REST over httpx for sends/edits/uploads. Approvals = message components (buttons). Streaming = throttled edits (rate-limit-aware, respect 429 buckets). Trust: DMs pair; servers/channels tracked-only. The community's own Discord server (OSS-OPERATIONS) runs this app as production dogfood.

### S6 — Email (`apps/email-channel`)

- Inbound: IMAP poll (stdlib `imaplib` in a thread executor, 60s cadence, UID-tracked; IDLE optional later), sender trust = address allowlist (pairing code = a reply containing the code); HTML→text via core `html2text` path. Outbound: SMTP (stdlib `smtplib`, thread executor; app-password auth documented; OAuth2 deferred with a DISCOVERY note). Threading via `Message-ID`/`In-Reply-To`/`References` → session_map keys. No streaming (capabilities say so); digest delivery target for plan 42's rules. Credential keys `EMAIL_IMAP_*`/`EMAIL_SMTP_*` via the credential store.

### S7-8 — The author ramp

- **Conformance kit:** `tests/channel_conformance.py` in core (exported for app use): given a provider instance + fake backend, asserts the contract — connect/send/receive echo shapes, capabilities dict completeness, health/test shapes, trust-seam integration (unknown-sender flow fires the canned reply + notification), fencing applied to non-owner content, streaming throttle honored. Slack/Telegram/Discord/email all pass it.
- **Guide:** `docs/guides/build-a-channel-app.md` extracted from the Telegram implementation (the cleanest reference): transport lifecycle, delivery-contract table with "must/should/may" per method, trust integration, linking, conformance-kit usage, packaging/manifest. Feeds ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING's `channel` scaffold template + bounty board (WhatsApp/Signal/Matrix as labeled community bounties with the risk-policy note).

## Contracts & Interfaces (this plan OWNS the trust seam; delivery/transport seams are existing, [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) §3.5)

### C1 — `src/gideon/channel_trust.py` (new; exported via `sdk/channel.py`, §2.8 → Tier-S)

```python
def is_allowed_sender(provider: str, sender_id: str) -> bool: ...
def allow_sender(provider: str, sender_id: str, name: str = "", *, via: str = "owner") -> None: ...
def deny_sender(provider: str, sender_id: str) -> None: ...
def is_tracked_channel(provider: str, channel_id: str) -> bool: ...
def track(provider: str, channel_id: str, name: str = "") -> None: ...
def untrack(provider: str, channel_id: str) -> None: ...
def create_pairing_code(provider: str) -> str: ...        # 8-digit, TTL 600s, hash stored, single active per provider
def redeem_pairing_code(provider: str, sender_id: str, code: str) -> bool: ...  # constant-time; consumes on success
def trust_policies(provider: str) -> dict: ...            # {"dm": "...", "group": "..."}
def fence_channel_content(text: str, provider: str, sender_id: str) -> str:
    return fence_untrusted(text, source=f"channel:{provider}:{sender_id}")  # §3.7
```

### C2 — Trust store `~/.gideon/entity_settings/channel_trust.json`

```jsonc
{
  "<provider>": {
    "allowed_senders": {"<id>": {"name":"", "added_at":"<ISO>", "via":"owner|pairing"}},
    "tracked_channels": {"<id>": {"name":"", "added_at":"<ISO>"}},
    "pairing": {"code_hash":"<sha256>", "expires_at":"<ISO>", "created_at":"<ISO>"},
    "policies": {"dm":"pairing|owner_only|open", "group":"tracked_only|off"},  // defaults: dm=pairing, group=tracked_only
    "rate": {"<sender_id>":"<ISO last canned-reply>"}   // 24h once-per-sender pairing-needed reply
  }
}
```
Corrupt/missing → defaults + warn (fail-open for the *store*; but an unknown sender is denied by *policy* — that's the fail-closed half). SEL events: `sender_paired`, `sender_denied`, `pairing_code_created`.

### C3 — Per-transport delivery obligation table (the conformance contract; full must/should/may in `docs/guides/build-a-channel-app.md`)

| ChannelDelivery method (§3.5) | Telegram | Discord | Email |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deliver_text` | MUST | MUST | MUST |
| `deliver_rich` | SHOULD (MarkdownV2) | SHOULD (embeds) | MAY (HTML) |
| streaming trio | SHOULD (throttled edit ≥1.1s) | SHOULD (edit, 429-aware) | MUST-NOT (capabilities: streaming=false) |
| `request_approval` | MUST (inline keyboard) | MUST (buttons) | SHOULD (reply-token) |
| `upload_attachment` | SHOULD | SHOULD | SHOULD (MIME parts) |
| `build_thread_link` | MUST (t.me deep link) | MUST | MAY (message-id anchor) |

Each transport declares honest `ChannelCapabilities` (§3.5 dataclass). Credential keys: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `EMAIL_IMAP_{HOST,USER,PASS,PORT}` / `EMAIL_SMTP_{...}` (credential store, §2.5).

### C4 — Conformance kit `tests/channel_conformance.py`
`assert_channel_contract(provider_instance, fake_backend)` — asserts: connect/send/receive echo shapes; `capabilities()` dict completeness; health/test shapes; unknown-sender flow (canned reply + `emit_attention_item(kind="agent_request")`); `fence_channel_content` applied to non-owner content before it enters session context; streaming throttle honored where declared. Every channel app's test suite calls it.

### Integration points
- **Calls:** `fence_untrusted` (§3.7), `session_map.set/get` (§3.5 linking), `emit_attention_item(kind="agent_request")` (plan 42 — owner Allow/Deny), `sel()`, `atomic_write`/`config_dir`.
- **Called by:** every channel transport (slack migrates onto it in S1 T1.4; Telegram/Discord/email consume it); plan 24 §3 inherits this seam (does NOT rebuild it).
- **Consumed by:** 42 (channel_dm delivery target routes through `ChannelDelivery.deliver_notification` on these transports).
- **Storage owned:** `channel_trust.json`; apps own their `data/config.json` (ProviderSettings, §2.6) + offset/UID state in `data/`.
- **SDK exports added:** the C1 API block + `fence_channel_content` in `sdk/channel.py`.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — Trust seam (core)

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | `channel_trust.py`: store + full API per Design (atomic writes, hash-only codes, constant-time redeem, rate-limit bookkeeping) | create `src/gideon/channel_trust.py`, `tests/test_channel_trust.py` | unit tests: allow/deny/track, pairing lifecycle (create/expire/single-use/wrong-code), policy defaults, corrupt-file → defaults+warning |
| T1.2 | `fence_channel_content()` helper wrapping `fence_untrusted` with the channel source format; sdk exports for the whole trust API | `src/gideon/channel_trust.py`, `src/gideon/sdk/channel.py` | import-boundary test still green; helper covered by test |
| T1.3 | SEL events (`sender_paired/denied`, `pairing_code_created`) + owner notification with Allow/Deny actions on unknown-sender (reuse the existing notification-action mechanism — locate Slack's Allow/Deny prompt wiring and generalize the *notification* half into core, leaving Slack's in-channel prompt UX app-side) | `channel_trust.py`, notification wiring site (locate via `allowlist.py` imports) | unknown-sender fixture produces one SEL entry + one actionable notification; Allow action persists the sender |
| T1.4 | Slack app onto the seam: `persist_allowed_user/tracking_channel` delegate to core trust; one-time loud `migrate_to_core_trust()` moving its JSON into the core store (idempotent, logged) | apps repo: `slack-channel/slack_runtime/allowlist.py`, `settings.py` | slack tests green; migration fixture: app-local entries appear in core store once, second run no-op |
| T1.5 | `gideon pair <provider>` CLI (creates + prints a code with TTL note) + `docs/reference/cli.md` entry | `src/gideon/cli.py` | code printed once; redeem within TTL works, after TTL refuses |
| V1 | Validation: with the echo transport — unknown sender → canned reply + notification; pair via CLI code; sender now converses; group message from non-owner arrives fenced in session context (inspect stored context) | — | all hold; ledger written |

### Sessions 2-3 — Telegram

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Bot API client (`api.py`): typed thin wrappers for getUpdates/sendMessage/editMessageText/sendDocument/sendPhoto/answerCallbackQuery/getMe; httpx, timeout+retry/backoff; no SDK | apps repo: create `telegram-channel/{app.json,api.py,settings.py}` | MockTransport tests for each wrapper incl. 429 retry-after handling |
| T2.2 | MarkdownV2 escaper (`format.py`): table-driven tests over the full reserved set + code blocks + links | `telegram-channel/format.py`, tests | every reserved char case passes; round-trip of a chat message with code fences renders (manual check in V) |
| T2.3 | Transport: long-poll loop (offset persistence in app `data/`), ChannelMessage mapping, trust-seam integration (DM pairing flow, group tracked-only, fencing), `capabilities()` honest (edit-streaming, reply-threads) | `telegram-channel/transport.py` | conformance kit passes once T7.1 exists (until then: unit tests for mapping + trust hooks) |
| T2.4 | Delivery: `ChannelDelivery` implementation — text/rich (MarkdownV2), throttled edit-streaming (≥1.1s + final flush), uploads, `request_approval` inline keyboard wired to the approval answer path (find Slack's `request_approval` → answer plumbing and mirror it), `build_thread_link` | `telegram-channel/delivery.py` | fake-API tests: stream produces ≤1 edit/1.1s and exact final text; approval callback resolves the pending approval |
| T2.5 | Setup/doctor contributions (plan 32 seams): token prompt (BotFather instructions), getMe probe | `telegram-channel/cli_setup.py`, `cli_doctor.py`, manifest | `gideon setup` configures Telegram end to end on a fixture |
| V2 | Validation (owner phone required — owner task 2): pair from a real phone via code; chat with tool-approval round-trip on inline buttons; background cron result delivered; loop status nudge; attachment both directions; group behavior (untracked silent, tracked + mention responds with fencing verified in logs) | — | full walkthrough recorded in Execution log |

### Sessions 4-5 — Discord

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4.1 | Gateway WS client: identify/heartbeat/ack/resume/dispatch (the four events), intents per Design, clean reconnect with session resume | apps repo: create `discord-channel/{app.json,gateway.py,settings.py}` | fake-WS tests: heartbeat cadence, resume after drop, dispatch routing |
| T4.2 | REST client + delivery (sends/edits/uploads/buttons; 429-bucket respect), streaming edits, `request_approval` buttons | `discord-channel/{api.py,delivery.py}` | fake-API tests incl. bucket backoff; approval round-trip |
| T4.3 | Transport + trust (DM pairing; guild channels tracked-only; fencing), capabilities honest | `discord-channel/transport.py` | conformance kit passes |
| T4.4 | Setup/doctor contributions (bot token, application id; probe = gateway hello) | `discord-channel/cli_setup.py`, `cli_doctor.py` | setup configures end to end |
| V4 | Validation on a real test server (owner task 3): DM pairing, channel tracking, approval buttons, streaming, the community-server dogfood checklist | — | recorded |

### Session 6 — Email

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T6.1 | IMAP poll transport (executor-threaded, UID-tracked, 60s), address-allowlist trust + code-in-reply pairing, HTML→text via core path | apps repo: create `email-channel/{app.json,transport.py,settings.py}` | fake-IMAP tests: new-mail detection, UID persistence, pairing reply |
| T6.2 | SMTP delivery (threaded), Message-ID threading → session_map, no-streaming capabilities, digest-target registration note for plan 42 | `email-channel/delivery.py` | fake-SMTP tests: headers correct (In-Reply-To/References), thread continuity across three messages |
| T6.3 | Setup/doctor (IMAP/SMTP hosts + app-password guidance for Gmail/Fastmail; probe = login+select) | `email-channel/cli_setup.py`, `cli_doctor.py` | setup configures end to end |
| V6 | Validation with a real mailbox (owner task 4): email in → session reply out threads correctly; pairing from an unknown address; digest lands once plan 42 S5 exists (else note deferred) | — | recorded |

### Sessions 7-8 — Ramp

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T7.1 | Conformance kit per Design (importable from apps' tests); wire into slack/telegram/discord/email test suites | core: `tests/channel_conformance.py` (+ export path decision recorded), 4 app test files | all four apps pass the kit in apps-repo CI |
| T7.2 | `docs/guides/build-a-channel-app.md` per Design (must/should/may table for all 18 delivery methods + transport lifecycle + trust + conformance usage) | new guide | a reader can map every ABC/protocol method to an obligation level |
| T7.3 | Bounty scaffolding: issues for WhatsApp/Signal/Matrix (community tier, risk-policy paragraph, guide + kit links); `channel` template registered with ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING's scaffold (coordinate — file DISCOVERY if scaffold not landed yet) | GitHub issues, cross-plan note | issues live and labeled |
| V7 | Validation: dry-run the guide as a stranger building a "null channel" against the kit in <2h | — | timed run recorded |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **Telegram:** create the bot via **@BotFather** (`/newbot` — pick name/username), copy the token into `gideon setup` when prompted; optionally set the bot's privacy mode per the guide. ~5 min.
2. **Telegram validation (V2):** your phone, ~30 min driving the walkthrough.
3. **Discord:** create an application + bot at discord.com/developers (enable *message content* intent), create a private test server, invite the bot with the scopes the setup step prints; later add it to the community server. ~15 min.
4. **Email:** dedicate a mailbox (fresh address recommended over your personal inbox), create an app password (Gmail/Fastmail flow per guide), run setup. ~10 min.
5. **Approve the channel risk-policy paragraph** (official-APIs-only for first-party; community tier for unofficial) before T7.3 publishes it.

## Risks & open questions

- **Discord gateway maintenance** is the highest-complexity piece (WS lifecycle); contained by the minimal-intents client + conformance kit. If it exceeds budget, ship Telegram+email first (owner's "few core channels" is satisfied) and let Discord ride a community bounty with the half-built client as a head start — E6 decision point, flagged early.
- **Telegram MarkdownV2** and **Discord rate buckets** are the two classic correctness traps — both have dedicated table-driven tests by design.
- **Open:** whether pairing prompts should also appear in channel (canned reply) when `dm_policy=owner_only` — default: no reply at all (silent), documented.

## Amendment (2026-08-05 — the shared TurnDriver + added channels)

A design analysis (see [PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY](PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE-PARITY.md)
§9) contributes two design inputs to this plan; both land **here**, not in a new plan.

- **Adopt a shared channel-neutral `TurnDriver` before the per-channel work (fold into S1).**
  The design factors a messaging driver: a `TurnDriver` consumes the provider event stream and emits
  abstract `OutputEvent`s to a per-channel `Renderer`, and it **owns credential/exfiltration
  redaction and the tool-approval ladder once**, so every channel inherits them rather than
  re-implementing. Each of their channels is then a uniform thin shape
  (`client / commands / gateway / renderer / transport / transport_dispatch`), which is why
  Teams/Webex/WeCom/WeChat are only ~1.3–1.5k LOC each. Our `ChannelTransportProvider`
  (`channel_transports/base.py`) is comparable but does **not** centralize the turn concerns —
  adopting a shared driver keeps every future channel thin and means redaction+approval can never
  drift per channel. **Recommendation:** land the driver as S1's trust-seam companion; Telegram (S2)
  is then the first consumer that proves it.
- **More channels are cheap once the driver exists (append to Wave 2).** Beyond the planned
  Discord/email, Teams/Webex/WeCom/WeChat are small on the shared driver — add them as Wave-2 rows
  when the driver + Telegram/Discord have proven the shape. Community-tier rules
  (WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage — official APIs only) are unchanged.
- **Slack hardening read.** A mature Slack app design is ~21k LOC with dedicated `enterprise.py`,
  `channel_resolver.py`, `interactions.py`, `blocks.py`, and `retry.py`. Before extending our
  slack-channel app, study those concerns for enterprise-workspace handling, interaction robustness, and
  retry/backoff — a hardening pass on the existing app, not a rewrite.

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — gap analysis round 2, owner decisions)

**The vendor-completeness pattern (owner decision; Slack is the exemplar).** Manifest recon (2026-07-26, `GideonApps/slack-channel/app.json`): today the Slack app registers exactly ONE provider — `provider: {type: "channel", implementation: slack_runtime.transport:create_provider}` with a settingsSchema. It does NOT register an inbox source (core's `inbox_providers/__init__.py` docstring promises channel apps contribute one — "sources (e.g. 'slack') are contributed by their app bundle" — but no `type: "inbox"` provider exists in the manifest), and trigger sources don't exist as a seam yet (the substrate plan owns that). Meanwhile the manifest machinery already supports everything the pattern needs: multiple providers per app (`AppManifest.providers[]` / `all_providers()`), a `ui` manifest block, and `PROVIDER_TYPES` already includes `inbox`.

**The pattern (each channel author follows it; telegram/discord/email inherit):**

1. **ONE vendor app registers EVERY provider seam that vendor touches** via the manifest `providers[]` list: the `channel` transport (existing), an `inbox` message source (`MessageSourceProvider` — Slack's is the missing exemplar piece), a **trigger source** once WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE exposes app-registered source types (coordination note there — e.g. Slack events as trigger sources), and its settings/config UI as **contributed UI** (manifest `ui` block) where the generic provider-settings form doesn't fit.
2. **Anything not fitting a pluggable seam becomes that vendor app's own UI surface** (a `ui` page inside the app) — NEVER a core accommodation. If a vendor feature seems to need a core change, the change is a new *generic* seam or it doesn't happen.
3. **Core never names the vendor.** The two known residues (the `inbox_providers` docstring's "e.g. slack"; `native_source.py`'s comment) are comment-level only — scrub them while touching the seam; PROVIDER-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION's rule ("do not add residue") stays binding.

Fit with this plan: S1's trust seam and C3's obligation table stay exactly as designed — the pattern ADDS the "register every seam" completeness bar on top. The S7-8 author ramp is where it becomes teachable: the guide + conformance kit grow a vendor-completeness section, and the Slack app is brought up to the full pattern as the reference implementation.

### Session placement

Extends **Sessions 7-8** (the ramp — the guide/kit are being written there anyway) plus one Slack task; the trigger-source leg is a *forward obligation* documented now, implemented per-app only after the substrate's seam exists. No count change (S7-8 absorb it).

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T7.4 | Slack to full pattern: add the `inbox` provider registration (`MessageSourceProvider` over the existing runtime client) to `providers[]`; move any non-seam Slack-specific surface behind the app's own `ui` block; scrub vendor-name residue from core seam comments | apps repo `slack-channel/app.json` + `slack_runtime/`, core `inbox_providers/` docstrings | Slack messages flow through the generic inbox source seam (no core slack string); manifest registers ≥2 providers; boundary tests green |
| T7.5 | Guide + kit: vendor-completeness section in `build-a-channel-app.md` (the seam checklist: channel + inbox + trigger-source-when-available + contributed UI; rule 2's "your UI, not core's" doctrine) + a conformance-kit check that a channel app also registers an inbox source (or declares why not) | `docs/guides/build-a-channel-app.md`, `tests/channel_conformance.py` | the checklist is explicit in the guide; telegram/discord/email tasks (S2-6) cite it; kit flags a channel-only app with a warning |
| T7.6 | Trigger-source forward note: coordination line into WORKFLOWS-V2-AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE (app-registered trigger source types) so each vendor app adds its trigger-source provider when that seam lands — no early hand-rolled event glue | this plan + substrate plan cross-refs | both plans reference one seam; no vendor app ships bespoke trigger machinery before it exists |

## Execution log

- **2026-08-09 — DONE: CE-3** (Telegram channel app, Sessions 2-3 T2.1–T2.5, apps#26).
  Recorded retroactively — this plan had no Execution log section when CE-3 landed, so the entry
  lived only in the atomic mirror. Shipped `GideonApps/telegram-channel/`: a
  `ChannelTransportProvider` (`getUpdates` long-poll, offset persisted and advanced before dispatch)
  + `ChannelDelivery` over the raw Bot API on `httpx`, no vendor SDK, core imported only via
  `gideon.sdk.*`. 108 bundle tests green, SDK-only boundary lint clean. **V2 pending:** the
  owner real-phone walkthrough (Owner tasks 1-2) is a real-world step outside automated execution.

- **2026-08-09 — DONE: CE-4** (Discord channel app, Sessions 4-5 T4.1–T4.4, apps#29).
  Shipped `GideonApps/discord-channel/` — the second channel onto the CE-1 trust seam, built
  to the same shape as Telegram. Both wire protocols are implemented directly against libraries core
  already depends on (`websockets`, `httpx`), so the bundle contains no vendor SDK anywhere (tests
  included) and declares no `pythonDependencies`; core is imported only via `gideon.sdk.*`.
  - **T4.1 gateway (`gateway.py`)** — the full WS lifecycle: HELLO-driven heartbeat with ACK
    tracking, IDENTIFY with the intents bitfield summed from NAMED bits (guilds | guild_messages |
    direct_messages | message_content = **37377**), READY → `session_id`/`resume_gateway_url`,
    RESUME (op 6) with the last *processed* seq, INVALID_SESSION (honoring the resumable boolean),
    RECONNECT (op 7). Two traps contained: the **zombied connection** (a beat unacked when the next
    is due means the gateway stopped processing us while the socket still looks open → close
    **4000**, never 1000, which would make the session unresumable, then resume), and the
    **silent-bitfield failure** (a wrong intents int connects fine and the events you didn't ask for
    simply never arrive — so the value is pinned three ways plus a dedicated `DIRECT_MESSAGES` guard,
    since dropping bit 12 yields 33281 and a bot that can never be paired by DM).
  - **T4.2 REST + delivery (`api.py`, `delivery.py`)** — Discord's real difference from a flat
    `retry_after` API is that rate limits are **per-bucket**: bucket state is folded from the
    response headers and an exhausted bucket is waited off *pre-emptively* rather than spending a 429
    to learn it, a global limit is tracked separately from a per-route one, and buckets key on
    method + concrete path so one busy channel cannot stall another. Approvals are message
    **components**: an Approve/Deny action row whose `custom_id` carries the request id, resolved by
    the `INTERACTION_CREATE` press and *always* acknowledged inside Discord's three-second window
    even for a stale id, after which the prompt is edited to its outcome with `components` stripped
    so no clickable Approve survives a decision. Streaming is throttled edits with an exact final
    flush; text splits at 2000.
  - **T4.3 transport + trust (`transport.py`)** — runs the REAL core seam (`guard_inbound`, provider
    `"discord"`): DMs pair, guild channels are tracked-only, non-owner content is fenced before it
    enters a session. `is_dm` is derived from the **absence of `guild_id`** (Discord's actual signal,
    not a channel-type guess). Self-authored and other-bot messages are dropped — `MESSAGE_CREATE`
    fires for the bot's own sends, and without that filter the bot answers itself forever; the trap
    does not exist for Telegram's `getUpdates`. Capabilities are honest: every `True` has an
    implementation behind it (reactions, typing_indicator included), `max_text_len=2000`.
  - **T4.4 setup/doctor** — app-owned `dm_activation` + `application_id` in the app's own store, bot
    token in the shared credential store under the app's own `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` key. The
    application id is deliberately NOT a credential: Discord prints it publicly and it rides in every
    invite URL, so storing it as a secret would claim a secrecy it lacks and hide it from the
    Configure form. Setup prints the OAuth2 invite URL with exactly the six permission bits the code
    exercises (274878008384 — no ADMINISTRATOR, test-guarded); doctor points at the Channels-page
    Test for the live `GET /gateway/bot` hello probe, which is T4.4's named probe.
  - **Gate:** 198 bundle tests green with no network and no wall-clock sleeps (`httpx.MockTransport`,
    a scripted fake WebSocket, injected heartbeat/throttle clocks; trust exercised against the real
    core seam in an isolated `GIDEON_HOME`). Manifest round-trip stable + `validate()` clean;
    SDK-only boundary lint clean under CI's repo-wide logic including `conftest.py`;
    `telegram-channel` 108 still green. The zombie check, the 4000-not-1000 close code, the
    `DIRECT_MESSAGES` bit, the `is_dm` derivation, the self-message filter and the global-429 gate
    were each **falsified by breaking them** — every break reds a specific test.
  - **DISCOVERY (two defects the tests surfaced):** `_handle_dispatch` coerced a bogus non-dict `d`
    to `{}` via `frame.get("d") or {}` and handed handlers a silently-empty event (now: `None` → `{}`
    is legitimate for RESUMED, any other non-dict is dropped with a warning). And a tmp
    `GIDEON_HOME` alone is **not** test isolation — core's `save_credential` mirrors values
    into `os.environ` and `load_credentials` reads them back, so one test's owner id stayed visible
    to the next and a missing-owner assertion passed on stale state.
  - **V4 pending (owner):** validating against a real Discord application, bot and test server
    (Owner tasks 3) needs a human in the Developer Portal — create the application, **enable the
    MESSAGE CONTENT privileged intent** (without it every message arrives with empty `content`, the
    single most common reason a Discord bot looks broken), and invite the bot. The automated suite
    covers the protocol; it cannot cover "Discord accepted this token."
  - **Unblocks:** CE-6 (the conformance kit) now needs only CE-5; CE-7 follows it.

- **2026-08-09 — DONE: CE-5** (Email channel app, Session 6 T6.1–T6.3, apps#30).
  Shipped `GideonApps/email-channel/` — the third channel onto the CE-1 trust seam, and the
  last one the conformance kit was waiting for. Stdlib `imaplib`/`smtplib` **only**: no vendor SDK,
  no new `pythonDependencies`, core imported exclusively via `gideon.sdk.*`.
  - **Not the `mail-inbox` app.** `mail-inbox` (EIAT-2) is a `MessageSourceProvider` — mail as a
    read-only inbox *source* with its own allowlist. This is the *channel* §Boundary of plan 43
    reserves for CHANNEL-EXPANSION, and per that boundary it **reuses** the trust seam rather than
    forking one: trust is owned by core `channel_trust` (`provider="email"`), so this app keeps no
    allowlist of its own. Separate bundles with no shared imports (apps cannot import each other);
    where `mail-inbox` already got a MIME trap right, this follows it.
  - **T6.1 poll transport (`transport.py`, `imap_client.py`)** — both stdlib APIs block, so every
    IMAP/SMTP call crosses a thread executor; one blocking `select()` on the loop would stall the
    whole gateway. The loop is **UID-based, never sequence numbers** (which renumber on expunge and
    would silently skip or reprocess), read-only, and persists `last_uid` + `UIDVALIDITY` in the
    app's data dir so a restart neither reprocesses nor skips. Two traps contained: the
    **UIDVALIDITY check runs before the search** and re-derives the cursor under the new numbering,
    so a renumbered mailbox *recovers* instead of staying permanently skipped; and the cursor
    advances **before** dispatch (and on `CancelledError`) so a raising handler cannot replay one
    message forever. Trust is keyed on the `parseaddr` address **only**, with the `local@domain`
    shape verified rather than assumed — so `From: "bob@allowed.example" <attacker@evil.example>`
    is denied, the display name being attacker-controlled and used for UI text alone. Self-authored
    inbound is dropped: providers copy sent mail into the inbox and a reply-to-self loops forever
    (the same trap Discord has via `MESSAGE_CREATE`, absent from Telegram's `getUpdates`). Pairing
    is a reply containing the 8-digit code, redeemed through `redeem_pairing_code`. Fail-closed
    throughout — an unparseable message, a missing `From`, or a trust-store read failure denies and
    continues the loop; allowed non-owner content enters the session as `guard_inbound`'s
    `fenced_text`, never raw.
  - **T6.2 SMTP delivery (`delivery.py`, `smtp_client.py`, `mime.py`)** — outbound sets
    `In-Reply-To` plus an accumulating `References` chain keyed through `session_map`, so three
    messages stay one conversation in a real mail client. Per Contract C3 (Email column):
    `deliver_text` MUST, `deliver_rich` MAY as an HTML alternative, `request_approval` by reply
    token, `upload_attachment` as a MIME part, `build_thread_link` as a `mid:` anchor. Connections
    open per send (providers drop idle sessions) and a failed STARTTLS **aborts** rather than
    retrying in the clear.
  - **T6.3 setup/doctor** — IMAP/SMTP hosts with app-password guidance for Gmail/Fastmail; the
    doctor probe is login + select, as the task specifies.
  - **Gate:** 306 bundle tests green with no network, no wall-clock sleeps and no writes outside a
    tmp home (fake IMAP/SMTP servers and clocks injected, not monkeypatched onto stdlib; trust
    exercised against the real core seam in an isolated `GIDEON_HOME`). Manifest round-trip
    stable + `validate()` clean, permissions `{storage, network}`, no `pythonDependencies`; SDK-only
    boundary lint clean under CI's repo-wide logic including `conftest.py` and `_fakes.py`;
    `telegram-channel` 108 and `mail-inbox` 32 still green. Six load-bearing controls were
    **falsified by breaking them**: the UID advance/persistence, the self-message filter, the
    `parseaddr`-only trust match, the `References` chain across three messages, the streaming-trio
    no-op, and the fenced-text-into-session path.
  - **DEVIATION (streaming=false):** the shipped `ChannelCapabilities` dataclass has no `streaming`
    field, so the plan's "capabilities declare streaming=false" is expressed as **`edits=False`** —
    in every other channel a stream *is* a repeatedly-edited message, so no-edits means no-streaming
    — plus `start_stream()` returning `""` with no-op `append_stream_task`/`stop_stream`. One test
    pins both halves together so the declaration cannot drift from the behavior.
  - **DEVIATION (credential keys):** the plan names `EMAIL_IMAP_{HOST,USER,PASS,PORT}` /
    `EMAIL_SMTP_{...}`. Only the two `*_PASS` keys are secret, so only those live in the credential
    store (verbatim names); hosts, users and ports live in `ProviderSettings` where the user can see
    and edit them, and no secret appears in `settingsSchema` at all — following `mail-inbox`.
    Claiming secrecy for a hostname would hide it from the Configure form for nothing.
  - **DISCOVERY (three defects the tests surfaced):** `parseaddr` returns a bare token like
    `not-an-address` as the *address* half, so the trust key was not required to be an address at
    all — now shape-verified. The `UIDVALIDITY` check originally ran *after* the search, which is
    precisely the failure it claimed to prevent (a renumbered mailbox stayed permanently skipped);
    a test now proves the channel recovers, not merely resets. And `imap_use_ssl` was declared in
    the settings schema with **no `setup` writer**, making a plain-IMAP port-143 mailbox unreachable
    from `gideon setup` — an audit now shows all 12 declared keys have both a runtime reader
    and a setup writer.
  - **DEFERRED, with reasons in the README:** OAuth2/XOAUTH2 (DISCOVERY note; app-password auth is
    documented for Gmail/Fastmail, which is what §S6 specifies). IMAP **IDLE** — `imaplib` has no
    IDLE support, so it means hand-rolling the command plus its 29-minute re-issue cycle; the plan
    already calls IDLE optional-later, and the 60s poll cadence is configurable. The **plan-42 S5
    digest target** — `deliver_notification` is the hook, but core's `notification_rules.TARGETS`
    carries `channel_dm` with **no dispatcher wired**, so a digest lands as an inbox item today;
    nothing in this app changes when that lands. (This is the atom's "digest-target deferral noted
    if plan-42 S5 absent" clause, discharged.)
  - **V6 pending (owner):** a dedicated mailbox plus an app password, then a real send/receive/
    pairing walkthrough (Owner tasks 4). The suite covers the protocol; it cannot cover "this mail
    provider accepted this app password."
  - **Unblocks:** CE-6 (the conformance kit) — all five of its atom deps are now `done`, leaving
    only its `EXT:INBOX-NOTIFICATIONS-UNIFICATION` note, which the plan says uses the existing
    notification path until that lands. CE-7 follows CE-6 + CE-8.
- [2026-08-10][CE-8 / T7.4] **BLOCKED (E1 — premise mismatch on the discovery seam).** Parts 2-4 of the done-when are done and shippable; part 1 ("registers an inbox `MessageSourceProvider` **over the existing runtime client**" that Slack messages actually **flow through**) cannot be met without building a bridge this atom does not own, so I stopped rather than ship a declared-but-inert provider.
  - **What IS done and verified.** Core's inbox seam is now vendor-neutral: the three Slack strings are scrubbed (`inbox_providers/native_source.py` lines 3 + 10, and the `get_default_provider` docstring), `grep -i slack src/gideon/inbox_providers/` is empty. The app's `app.json` now declares TWO providers — the existing `channel` (`transport:create_provider`) plus a new `inbox` (`slack_runtime.inbox_source:create_provider`) — and `AppManifest.all_providers()` concatenates `provider` + `providers`, consumed live at `providers/registry.py:64`. `slack-channel` is the FIRST app to use the `providers` array. A full `SlackInboxSource(MessageSourceProvider)` adapter is written over the EXISTING `RealSlackClient` (no second Slack client): all six ABC members mapped — `poll` via `conversations_history` with the Slack `ts` as core's checkpoint cursor, `send_reply`→`post_message`, `add_reaction`, `get_channel_history`, cached `resolve_user_name`→`get_user_info`. Imports core only via `gideon.sdk.inbox` (verified: it re-exports `MessageSourceProvider` + `IncomingMessage`).
  - **The blocker, confirmed three independent ways.** (1) Core resolves inbox sources ONLY through importlib entry points: `get_message_providers()` → `discover_providers("gideon.message_source_providers", …)`, and the `inbox` type handler is an `EntitySeamHandler` whose own docstring says "entry-point discovery … **no in-memory registry**". (2) The app install pipeline never makes an app an installed *distribution* — `app_manager._install_python_deps` pip-installs an app's declared `pythonDependencies` only — so an app can never contribute an entry point to that group. (3) Even if it could, `discover_providers` binds a module-level class named `Provider`/`<Name>Provider`; a `create_provider` FACTORY (the manifest contract every other provider type uses) is invisible to it. Net: a manifest `inbox` provider lands on `RegisteredProvider.extra` and nothing in the inbox path ever reads it, so messages cannot flow.
  - **What would unblock it (owner decision — a contract change, not a fix inside CE-8).** Either (a) core teaches the inbox seam to resolve app-contributed `inbox` providers from the app registry via each manifest's `implementation` factory (the same resolution every other app provider type already uses), or (b) the app-install pipeline starts registering real entry points. (a) is the smaller, more consistent change and belongs to the INBOX/provider-seam contract owner. Until then CE-8's part 1 is unbuildable as specified; the scrub + manifest + adapter are staged on branches `feature-ce8-slack-inbox-source` in both repos and become live the moment the seam resolves manifest providers.
  - Not shipped as a PR: shipping the adapter alone would add exactly the inert-control defect this roadmap keeps fixing (a provider declared in a manifest that no runtime path can reach).
