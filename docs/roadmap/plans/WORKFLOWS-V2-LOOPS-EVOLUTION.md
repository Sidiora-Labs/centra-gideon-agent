# WORKFLOWS-V2-LOOPS-EVOLUTION

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/WF2LOO.md`](../atomic/WF2LOO.md) as 11 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Loop Kinds Evolution — Loops as Workflow Templates

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — sessions 29-33 shipped (PRs #168-#172, on `main`): judge contract,
pre-tier, actors, loop middleware, calibration, aliases, and 5 of 8 templates.
🔴 **BUT THE RUN-PATH INTEGRATION IS INERT** — `workflows/{loop_middleware,judge_calibration,
judge_pretier,judge_actors}.py` have **ZERO production importers** (AST audit 2026-08-04); the
cluster is self-referential, nothing emits `judge_verdict`/`judge_divergence`, and the steering queue
is stored but never consumed. The plan's own log admits this four times. Criteria 2/3/8/9/11 are
unmet until one wiring session lands. The legacy `src/gideon/loop/` remains the live engine.
Status corrected 2026-08-04 by code audit. (rev 2 — research-integrated 2026-07-12)

- **LOOP-R6** — Migration Path Phases 3-4: retirement acceptance criteria (nodding-loop detector, five-moves audit, provenance tags)
- **LOOP-R7** — Migration Checklist: fresh-session retry = structured handoff + worker lifecycle protocol + executor capability flags
- **LOOP-R8** — Judge Design: deterministic verification tier before and beneath every LLM judge

## Overview

All five loop kinds (goal, research, general, code, design) evolve into **bundled workflow templates** that compose the standard Workflows v2 node types. This replaces the need for a separate loop-kind-strategy engine with the universal workflow execution platform while preserving the domain intelligence that makes each kind valuable.

**Key decision:** Loops remain operational as-is during the transition period. The workflow templates are the NEW way to express the same patterns; existing loops are NOT forcibly migrated. Over time, users create workflow-based projects instead of loops, and the old loop engine becomes legacy.

**Soul check:** everything here stays personal-scale — one user, local files, local SQLite, no fleet machinery. Self-scheduling is bounded by construction; learning artifacts are *proposed*, never silently written.

---

## Reality Baseline (recon-verified 2026-07-12)

The plan is grounded on what actually exists, not what earlier drafts assumed:

- **The loop engine is already pluggable.** `loop/kinds/__init__.py` defines a `LoopKindStrategy` Protocol + registry — a new kind is one module + `register()`, no engine edits. What templates buy is not "escaping a monolith" but *user-composable graphs*: today's kinds are closed Python strategies; templates are open, editable node trees.
- **`tick.evaluate` is NOT the watchdog's brain.** The pure decision core (`loop/tick.py`) is consumed ONLY by the sdlc kind (`kinds/sdlc.py:_tick_decide`). Goal/general kinds use judge/verify signals directly. Any "port tick to the engine" claim scopes to the sdlc→code-project mapping only.
- **The real loop judge is already ground-truth-injecting and adversarial.** `loop/judge.py` runs `assess_cycle` + `assess_cycle_skeptic` and `adjudicate()` requires TWO yeses for done (one suffices for regressed); `_observe_ground_truth` re-runs the verify command and reads deliverable files into the judge prompt; judge sessions get NO write tools (permission requests rejected). The bundled templates must MATCH this bar, not water it down (see Judge Design below — rev 1 shipped `tools_posture: none` judges, contradicting its own checklist).
- **Judge calibration has real numbers.** `loop/granularity.py` maps the dial to (threshold T, window N): quick 3.0/1, balanced 2.0/2, exhaustive 1.0/3 on the 0-5 `marginal_value` scale; calibrated bands need ≥4 samples; `loop/instrument.py` ships a `probe_judge` canary (strong-vs-null separation ≥1.5) and a `judge_blind` NEEDS_INPUT halt. Rev 1's example values (`marginal_threshold: 0.3, streak_for_done: 5`) matched neither scale — corrected below.
- **Worker trust is three-fold**: `session._trust=True` + `sessions.set_approval_policy(key, "auto")` + `session._unattended` (plus `acp_mode="bypassPermissions"` for unattended ACP workers). Miss one and runs stall on approvals (loop/manager.py:start). Template runs must set all three the same way.
- **The behaviors at risk in migration live in `gateway._fire` + the watchdog**, not in plan structure: deliverable-forcing re-prompt with fresh-ACP-session retry (`_MAX_CYCLE_REPROMPTS`), autonudge as the cycle ticker, trust-TTL expiry, stagnation windows, `reap_orphaned_loops` boot recovery. The Migration Checklist below names every one.
- **No workflow execution engine exists today.** `workflows/` is definitions + surfacing + checklist injection (`workflow_run` returns text; the agent executes). Everything below assumes WORKFLOWS-V2 Slices 0-2 deliver the run engine first.

### Where the new pieces plug into the provider architecture

Provider fidelity is non-negotiable; every new piece uses an existing seam:

| New piece | Real seam |
|---|---|
| The 8 bundled templates | Bundled workflow definitions synced by `NativeWorkflowProvider` from `workflows/bundled/` (workflows/native.py) — same path existing SOP starters use. Third parties can ship template packs as `type: workflow` provider apps (→ `workflows/registry.py` via the workflow `_TypeHandler`) |
| `set_onetime_task` / `set_recurring_task` tools (R15) | New tool module registered in `mcp_core._TOOL_MODULES` + `tool_providers/registry.py` (same pattern as `mcp_workflows.py`); the triggers themselves are AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE entities |
| Judge isolation sessions (R1) | `SubagentManager.spawn()` with the internal-secret `approval_mode="auto"` path; judge model resolution via the **`reasoning`** use-case axis (`llm_helpers.one_shot_completion`) — NOT chat/code_tools, which return the NativeAgentRuntime |
| Judge-verdict ledger events (R3) | Run Ledger events (WORKFLOWS-V2 data model). Consumed by LEARNING-FLYWHEEL — this is MEMORY-side (harness mechanics), never written to the knowledge store |
| New SSE event types (steering, breaker-trip, verdict, divergence) | Per-run SSE registry + the FE `RUN_LIFECYCLE` union in `web/src/pages/loops/useRunStream.ts` — EventSource DROPS unregistered event types; every new event MUST be added there |
| Any new config keys (e.g. `workflows.judge_samples_default`, `workflows.self_schedule_max_outstanding`) | The FOUR wiring points: dataclass `_meta`, `AppConfig.load` mapping, `to_dict`, PATCH `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` |
| Any new action provider (none currently planned; R15 uses tools, not hooks) | Would additionally require `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555) |

## Architecture: Templates + Runtime Behavior Layer

### The Problem the Critique Identified

A naive "just make it a template" approach loses the done-ness intelligence that lives in the loop engine today — judge calibration, stagnation heuristics, goal-type-specific exit criteria, and the adaptive cycle-to-cycle nudge prompts. Templates are static structure; loops have runtime intelligence.

### The Solution: Workflow-Level `runtime_hints`

WorkflowDefs gain an optional `runtime_hints` dict (opaque to the engine core, consumed by the `stage` prompt-renderer and a small set of engine-enforced invariants at execution time).

**(R9) The hints split into two ORTHOGONAL groups** — semantic judge calibration vs structural execution shape — so one blob doesn't tangle the axes across 5 kinds:

```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowDef:
    # ... existing fields ...
    runtime_hints: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
```

```yaml
runtime_hints:
  judge:                      # SEMANTIC: what "done/good" means (R1, R2, R3, R8)
    rubric:                   # (R3) machine-checkable convergence contract —
      - {criterion: "...", target_score: 2}   #   fixed 0-2 dimensions, evidence citation per
      - {criterion: "...", target_score: 1}   #   score, hard per-criterion thresholds
    ratchet: strict           # strict | relaxed — any shortfall fails the stage; no averaging
    stop_condition: {consecutive_clean: 2}    # (R3) double-clean rule: exit only after N
                                              # consecutive INDEPENDENT clean judge passes
    marginal_threshold: 2.0   # 0-5 scale, seeded from the REAL granularity dial
                              # (quick 3.0/1, balanced 2.0/2, exhaustive 1.0/3)
    forbidden_success_modes:  # (R1) explicit denylist of degenerate passes the judge must
      - "test deleted or skipped"             # verify did NOT occur; worker tampering with
      - "gate/validation config modified"     # validation config = automatic failure
      - "output stubbed or hardcoded"
    proof_command: "..."      # (R1) exact command the judge independently re-runs; actual
                              # output recorded into the Run Ledger event
    validator_script: "..."   # (R1) judge prefers executing the deliverable's declared
                              # validator over re-reading worker prose
    hidden_validation_commands: ["..."]       # (R1) rendered ONLY into judge prompts, never
                                              # the worker's; fixtures stored where the worker
                                              # has no read path (not just a separate prompt)
    ground_truth_sources: [node_ids]          # (R1) which node outputs are authoritative
                                              # MEASUREMENTS vs worker synthesis — "the LLM is
                                              # a formatter over measured data, never the
                                              # measurement"
    judge_isolation: fresh    # fresh | cross_model (R1) — never the session that produced the
                              # work; provenance-blinded (strip which retry produced the
                              # output); cross_model = different model FAMILY (same-family
                              # judges are a calibration failure mode one knob deeper)
    judge_samples: 3          # (R2) N-sample median aggregation, default 3 for terminal
                              # accept/reject gates (single-run LLM-judge acceptance was
                              # indistinguishable from noise)
    fallback_check: command_exit_code         # (R8) artifact_exists | command_exit_code |
                                              # diff_nonempty — deterministic fallback AND
                                              # standing cross-check; a judge PASS that
                                              # contradicts it auto-escalates
    freedom_level: high       # high | medium | low (R9) — low-freedom templates judged on
                              # per-step compliance; high-freedom on outcome rubric (per-step
                              # judging mis-measures a research loop)

  execution:                  # STRUCTURAL: how the run behaves (R4, R7, R9, R13)
    depth: balanced           # fast | balanced | production (R9) — prunes gates per rigor;

    escalation:               # (R4) numeric strategy ladder, engine-consumed on breaker trip
      attempt_cap: 3
      ladder: [classified_retry, fresh_session, model_switch, restart_from_scratch, surface]

      retrieval_strategy: ... # replaces freeform prompt variation with tested parameters
      task_decomposition: ...
```

These hints flow into stage prompts via bindings (`{{defaults.runtime_hints.judge.rubric}}`) and `transform` expressions — **except** for the small set the engine ENFORCES rather than merely renders (marked below). The engine stays generic; the intelligence lives in the template's prompt engineering, binding wiring, and a handful of engine invariants.

**Engine-enforced invariants (not prompt suggestions):**

1. **(R9c) Judge-tier isolation:** judge/gate nodes never run on the same tier + session that produced the work under judgment. Enforced at node dispatch, using `SubagentManager` for fresh sessions.
2. **(R1 amendment-5) Actor-based state transitions:** the worker actor may transition a run/node only to `waiting`/`review`, NEVER to `done`. The terminal `done` transition is reserved for judge/gate actors — self-approval is impossible by construction, not by prompt doctrine.
3. **(R1 amendment-5) Proof-attachment precondition:** a judge PASS without a cited proof artifact (proof_command output, validator result, or deterministic-check record in the Run Ledger event) is itself invalid — completion records carry proof, always.
4. **(R5f) Expression-definable node success:** success conditions are expressions, not hardcoded exit-0 — reproduction workflows have inverted semantics (`fail_reproduced` IS success).
5. **(R5b) WIP=1 for code templates:** `single_active_feature` is a template rule the engine refuses to violate.

**Per-node `model_tier`:** `deterministic | cheap | standard | judgment` (R9 + amendment-5). `judgment` resolves via the `reasoning` use-case axis (active_models.json), same as today's `eval.LLMJudge`. `deterministic` (below `cheap`) skips LLM planning entirely for schema-validated simple steps — mostly satisfiable via existing `transform`/`action`/`gate` node kinds; template lint flags LLM stages doing deterministic work. **Mode-aware prompt framing** (interactive vs background preamble; background enforces structured output) lets one template serve blocking-chat and trigger-fired modes.

## Judge Design: Maker/Checker With Teeth (LOOP-R1, R2, R3, R8)

**This section is the headline fix.** Rev 1 contained an internal contradiction: the Migration Checklist claimed judge ground-truth independence was "PRESERVED BY CONSTRUCTION" while every shipped judge stage carried `tools_posture: none` — no bundled judge could even read the artifact it was supposed to verify. Meanwhile the REAL loop judge (`loop/judge.py`) already re-runs verify commands, reads deliverables (`_observe_ground_truth`), runs a skeptic second opinion, and requires TWO yeses to adjudicate done. The templates must meet or exceed that bar.

### The judge stage contract (every bundled judge)

1. **`tools_posture: verify`** (new posture; see Changes to WORKFLOWS-V2.md): read artifacts + run declared commands; NO write tools — same restriction today's judge sessions have (permission requests rejected, judge.py:354).
2. **Isolated + provenance-blinded** (R1): spawned via `SubagentManager`, never the worker session; which retry/iteration produced the output is stripped. `judge_isolation: cross_model` uses a different model FAMILY as the anti-rubber-stamping option.
3. **Independent proof** (R1): the judge re-runs `proof_command` (actual output → Run Ledger event) and prefers executing `validator_script` over re-reading worker prose. `hidden_validation_commands` render only into the judge prompt; validation fixtures live where the worker has no read path.
4. **Anti-injection evidence assembly** (R1 amendment, R13d): judge evidence transcripts structurally EXCLUDE worker narration blocks — only user/spec messages + tool calls + tool outputs. The worker cannot influence the judge through prose, including prose that survives compaction.
5. **Worker pre-announcement** (R1 amendment): worker prompts pre-announce the judge and its evidence demands, so first-pass quality rises mechanically.
6. **Prompt doctrine** (R1, R3 amendment): skeptical persona; "assume broken until proven otherwise"; explicit anti-leniency ("do not talk yourself into approving"); default-to-finding-3-5-issues; zero-issues-is-a-red-flag; scope-anchored (no luxury requirements beyond spec); anti-fence-sitting on graded scales; expected 2-3 revision cycles as healthy.

### Typed verdict contract (R2)

Judge/gate schemas use a CLOSED verdict enum so loop nodes route on data, not prose:

```yaml
schema:
  reasoning: string        # bounded free text BEFORE the verdict — constraints without
                           # reasoning room measurably hurt accuracy
  verdict: enum [PASS, REJECT, REPLAN, ESCALATE, NEEDS_INPUT]
  scores: {criterion: 0-2, ...}     # per-rubric-dimension, evidence citation each
  evidence_refs: [string]  # node/field/artifact citations
  cannot_judge: string     # typed escape hatch — refusal is parseable, not a parse failure
```

- **REPLAN** produces ONLY the remaining steps given the critique, preserving the frozen-region invariant with a monotonic global index — mid-flight replan gets a typed shape instead of ad-hoc mutation.
- **`judge_samples: N` median aggregation** (default 3) on terminal accept/reject gates. This also carries forward today's dual-judge adjudication (`assess` + `assess_cycle_skeptic`, TWO yeses): a terminal PASS requires the sampled median to pass AND no forbidden-success-mode hit.
- **Constrained decoding** / provider-native json-schema where the judge model supports it; fallback = parse-with-retry-that-re-presents-the-schema.
- **Derivable fields are engine-computed** (R3 amendment): overall score is recomputed server-side from dimension scores with fixed weights; the model's own overall survives only as metadata; derivable fields are null in the judge output schema so engine-computable values cannot drift.

### Deterministic tier before and beneath every judge (R8)

- **A free rule tier runs BEFORE any LLM judge call**: regex/heuristic failure patterns (tool errors, verbal give-ups), mechanical validation (schema/length/forbidden-content — most failures catchable in ~0.3ms), structural pre-checks (referenced files exist, links resolve), and a cheap existence/non-emptiness gate (artifacts/commits produced > 0) that must pass before the expensive judge invocation. Anything rule-solvable never reaches the probabilistic model. Loop judges run every cycle — this is the single biggest token saver in the plan.
- **Every judge/gate node declares `fallback_check`** (artifact_exists | command_exit_code | diff_nonempty): graceful degradation when the judge model is unavailable AND a standing cross-check when it isn't — a judge PASS contradicting the deterministic check auto-escalates.
- **Verification ladder ordering codified**: `verify_command` > artifact/visual check > LLM-judge-as-tiebreaker. Dual scoring (deterministic + LLM, averaged; judge-null falls back to deterministic) with strictly-greater score as the improvement-acceptance criterion for refine loops.
- This is the template-world descendant of `loop/gates.py:run_verify_command` (tristate True/False/None, `audit_bash_command` screen, exit-127→None) — the gate implementation carries over as-is.

### Calibration becomes measurable (R3)

- The rubric contract (in `runtime_hints.judge`, above) replaces rev 1's ad-hoc `judge_calibration: {marginal_value_threshold, streak_for_done}` — whose example values didn't even match the real dial's scale.
- **Free stuck detection** the engine evaluates off journal data: byte-identical scores across N cycles, or N consecutive failed cycles, auto-pauses the run. Zero LLM calls.
- **Every judge verdict persists as a first-class Run Ledger event**, citing the artifact/observation chain inspected; discarded/reverted iterations are recorded (`status=discard`), not just kept ones. This is the (verdict, ground-truth, override) dataset LEARNING-FLYWHEEL needs — free-text verdicts cannot be calibrated or diffed. (Memory-side data: harness mechanics, never the knowledge store.)
- **Judge-hardening loop** (Migration Checklist row): log judge reasoning; emit a `judge_divergence` event whenever the user overrides a verdict; patch the judge prompt at divergence points with few-shot scored exemplars. Expect 3-5 tuning rounds; criteria wording reviewed for steering side-effects. The existing `probe_judge` canary (strong-vs-null separation ≥1.5, `loop/instrument.py`) becomes the template-save-time calibration probe; an uncalibrated judge maps to the same `judge_blind` halt behavior the watchdog has today.

## Per-Kind Template Designs

All judge stages below follow the Judge Design contract; YAML shows the goal-pursuit judge in full and elides repetition elsewhere.

### 1. Goal Loop → `goal-pursuit` Template Family

Three variants by goal type: `goal-pursuit-verifiable`, `goal-pursuit-open-ended`, `goal-pursuit-monitor`.

**Verifiable variant** adds a `gate{kind: verify_command}` after the work loop (the descendant of goal-kind `run_verify_command` + the multi-sub-goal judge):

```yaml
    - id: verify
      kind: gate
      label: "Verify success"
      gate_kind: verify_command
      config:
        command: "{{inputs.verify_command}}"
        cwd: "{{inputs.scope[0]}}"
      on_timeout: pause_run
```

**Monitor variant (R15)** — no longer a degenerate `counted{n: max_cycles}` busy-loop. Monitoring becomes a **parked run + self-created clock trigger**:

- The run gains tool actions `set_onetime_task(when, payload)` and `set_recurring_task(schedule, payload)` — a new tool module (registered via `mcp_core._TOOL_MODULES` / `tool_providers/registry.py`, same pattern as `mcp_workflows.py`) that creates triggers in the AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE which re-enter the SAME run (the write-side counterpart of AUTO-R11's resume-targets) or spawn a linked follow-up run carrying prior findings as context.
- A monitor cycle that finds nothing new schedules its next check ("check back in 2h") and the run parks instead of burning cycles. Survives restarts via the substrate's persistence — replacing what monitor loops get today from autonudge + `reap_orphaned_loops`.
- **Safety bounds are first-class**: max outstanding self-created triggers per run (default 3, config `workflows.self_schedule_max_outstanding` — four wiring points); mandatory TTL on every self-created trigger; provenance tag (creating run id) listed in the run cockpit; creation obeys the run's autonomy mode (unattended runs self-schedule within bounds; per-stage runs surface it as an approval). Bounded by construction — personal-scale, not self-replicating job machinery.
- The monitor variant parameterizes its observation behavior via `runtime_hints.execution.strategy_axes` (typed enums for memory_extraction / observation_compression / retrieval_strategy / task_decomposition) and may tighten the breaker's fingerprint window (R4 amendment-5).
- Preserves the goal-kind monitor semantics: never self-completes; `budget_stop_genuine` carries over as a hint the terminal gate reads.

Simple multi-step extraction inside the gather loop chains on lightweight continuation signals (R9 amendment-5, heartbeat pattern); the full judge evaluation is reserved for phase boundaries — per-step judging over-taxes low-stakes chained steps.

### 3. General Loop → `general-project` Template

The "general" kind is the catch-all. **(R1.6 fix)** Rev 1's work stage self-reported `done: boolean` with no judge — violating the platform invariant that no agent certifies its own work (the loop engine's oldest rule). The default is now safe: a judge stage closes every iteration. A template author may opt out ONLY via an explicit `self_judged: true` flag, which the template lint surfaces as a warning badge.

```yaml

### 5. Design Loop → `design-project` Template

### 6. `diagnose` Template (new, LOOP-R12)

A bundled template (or skill) that operates over the Run Ledger and failure-signature records of a completed/failed loop-template run:

- **Method**: start from the failure signature → walk the execution trace chronologically → diff manifests/traces against the last successful run of the same template → classify into one of FOUR layers: **routing** (wrong template/profile selected), **execution** (tool errors/permission blocks), **verification** (output exists but doesn't match criteria), **governance** (halted by safety/budget check).
- **Rules**: evidence before intuition; localize before explaining; compare, don't guess; never summarize without citing node/field/artifact.
- **Output**: a structured diagnosis record `{layer, failing_node, root_cause_hypothesis, evidence_chain, recommended_action}` journaled as a Run Ledger event and surfaceable in the cockpit/needs-input inbox.
- Doubles as the standard post-mortem procedure for LEARNING-FLYWHEEL's failure-mining stage — structured failure records the flywheel can cluster without human labeling. (Run Ledger / memory side; not knowledge.)

---

## Engine Behaviors (loop-node middleware)

These are engine-level, not template-level — they replace what loops get today from `gateway._fire`, the watchdog, and the subagent reaper.

### No-progress circuit breaker + escalation ladder (LOOP-R4)

1. **A deterministic, LLM-free circuit breaker** as loop-node middleware, evaluated BEFORE each iteration off journal data: tool-argument fingerprinting; trip at 3 consecutive identical failures; extended headroom for recoverable classes (timeouts, rate limits); Continue → Nudge (inject corrective steering) → Halt ladder. Judges only see runs the breaker could not unstick. Costs zero LLM calls until it trips. Templates may declare/parameterize the breaker per-loop-node (`runtime_hints.execution.breaker` — e.g. a stricter fingerprint window for monitor variants) while the engine default applies everywhere.
2. **On trip, switch STRATEGY** per the numeric ladder in `runtime_hints.execution.escalation`: `[classified_retry, fresh_session, model_switch, restart_from_scratch, surface]`. Classified retry uses `failure_mutations` (failure_mode → corrective instruction) for targeted re-prompts. Failure classes route to distinct arms: malformed-output → resume-retry with feedback (cheap); wrong-work → fresh-session retry (expensive); rate-limit/429 → wait-and-retry with NO fresh session and no escalation. Restart-from-scratch (discard workdir, re-run from spec) is a distinct rung from fresh-session retry. Success resets counters. Proven abandonment values: `no_progress_stop: 5` consecutive non-improving, `hypothesis_abandon_after: 3` same-fix failures.
3. **"Never silence" exits**: a stalled leaf must exit via `needs_input {question, options}` or `incomplete {root_cause}` — the final escalation routes to a needs-input gate carrying a structured brief `{goal, attempts with verbatim error signatures, where stuck, recommendation, exact choices}`, never a raw transcript. (This upgrades the watchdog's NEEDS_INPUT/`stagnant` behaviors with structure.)

### Fresh-session retry + worker lifecycle protocol (LOOP-R7)

Rev 1's checklist row said only `fresh_session: true`; the mechanics every studied system converged on:

- **Structured handoff, clear-don't-compact**: the retry session resumes from on-disk artifacts + a 5-field ledger summary (`task_overview / current_state / important_discoveries / next_steps / context_to_preserve`), with prior-attempt error-signature digests injected so retries don't repeat a failed path. Assembly rule: immediate attempt inline; older attempts as pointers with a token cap.
- **Repair vs restart distinction**: repair keeps workspace progress (ground-truth check, e.g. commits-since-base), injects failure stage + bounded prior summary + "smallest patch" instruction, severity-tagged gap injection as the repair payload; attempt budget = max(execution_attempts, repair_rounds+1). Restart resets. Rewind-over-correct: prefer restarting from the last good checkpoint with a distilled learnings note rather than correction-polluted context.
- **Complete-or-block protocol**: a session terminating without an explicit signal is a protocol violation → node auto-transitions to `blocked`, never silently hung.
- **Engine-level liveness carried over from the watchdog/reaper**: heartbeats, stale-claim reclamation, long_running/stalled/stuck/lost classification, and verification of the NEW session's identity so a retry can't attach to a stale predecessor. (Descends from `LoopWatchdog` in-memory liveness + `SubagentManager._reaper_loop`/`_reconcile_orphans` — restart recovery re-arms, it does not resume counters; same design here.)
- **Atomic clarification consumption**: user clarifications threaded into a retried step are consumed atomically (single-use rows deleted in the resume transaction) so double-resume can't replay them.
- **Executor capability flags** (`runtime_hints.execution.executor_caps`: `supports_resume`, `supports_lifecycle_hooks`, `prompt_delivery`) so the engine branches correctly across Gideon's 3 ACP dialects — fresh-session retry only where resume is unsupported. (This generalizes today's fresh-ACP-retry heuristic: some ACP agents no-op repeat prompts, which is exactly why `gateway._fire` grows a fresh session.)
- **State-continuity default at iteration boundaries** (amendment-5): auto-persist-only-if-agent-didn't — the engine detects whether the worker explicitly stored its state at iteration end and only then auto-persists a summary, guaranteeing continuity across fresh sessions without double-writing or clobbering the agent's own richer checkpoint.
- **Trust plumbing parity**: retried/fresh worker sessions get the same three-fold trust setup loops get today (`_trust` + approval policy "auto" + `_unattended`, plus `acp_mode="bypassPermissions"` when unattended) — miss one and the run wedges on an option prompt.

### Context-overflow recovery within loop iterations (LOOP-R13)

Loops currently get compaction from the gateway; workflow-template loops must not crash on `prompt_too_long` or thrash:

- **Reactive**: on a context_length_exceeded error mid-iteration, attempt ONE forced compaction (micro-compact structural cleanup first, then LLM summarization if still over) and retry the turn; a `hasAttemptedReactiveCompact` flag prevents infinite compact-retry loops. After 3 consecutive compaction failures, disable auto-compact for that node execution.
- **Proactive** (amendment-5): topic-segmented history compression with attention ratios — current topic at high fidelity (~65% of budget), historical topics compressed to request/response pairs, oldest tier bulk-summarized; run asynchronously between iterations so the reactive path becomes the rare fallback. Topic segmentation gives `compaction_prompt` a structural unit (compact per-topic, not per-transcript), preserving typed carryover buckets (files touched, verified work, spawned children) that survive any context reset.
- **Judge boundary invariant**: judge/gate evidence transcripts assembled post-compaction exclude worker narration blocks — the worker cannot influence the judge through prose that survives compaction.

### Mid-run human steering channel (LOOP-R14)

Today the only ways to course-correct a running loop are cancel+restart (loses cycle context) or full mid-flight graph mutation (heavyweight). Three cheaper paths:

1. **Interrupt queue on loop nodes**: the user injects new instructions mid-flight; queued items are consumed atomically at the next iteration boundary and trigger a plan re-evaluation step (re-rank remaining sub-goals against the new instruction) before the next work cycle; journaled as a `steering` Run Ledger event. (This generalizes the loop `nudges.json` + guidance-file mechanism into a first-class engine feature.)
2. **Judge-comment triage**: judge/review stage output gains a line/location-anchored comment format; each comment is individually accept/rejectable by the user; the ACCEPTED subset is dispatched back to the SAME worker session as follow-up instructions — closing the loop that judge independence opened.
3. **Per-project judge-prompt overrides**: a file in the project/workspace beats the template's bundled judge prompt, resolved at render time and recorded in the ledger so verdicts are attributable to the prompt version that produced them.

New SSE events (`steering`, `breaker_trip`, `judge_divergence`, `comment_triage`, `self_scheduled`) MUST be added to the FE `RUN_LIFECYCLE` union (`web/src/pages/loops/useRunStream.ts`) — EventSource silently drops unregistered event types.

## What Is Gained

| Dimension | Old Loop Engine | Workflow Template |
|---|---|---|
| Composability | Closed strategies; can't insert custom stages between classify/execute | Open graph; user inserts/removes/reorders nodes freely |
| Visibility | Per-kind cockpit with pre-defined layout | Universal widget showing the exact node tree + per-node status |
| Editability | Limited (pause, change granularity, add sub-goals, guidance files) | Full mid-flight mutation + the cheap interrupt-queue path (R14) |
| Reuse | Each kind is a registered Python strategy (pluggable, but code-only) | Templates compose from shared primitives; custom templates are data |
| Domain support | 5 bundled kinds (a 6th is one module + register(), but still code) | Unlimited templates; unknown domains generate from scratch |
| Multi-model | Single model per loop | Per-node model_tier (deterministic/cheap/standard/judgment) |
| Judge accountability | Verdicts in per-loop files; calibration via probe canary | Typed verdict ledger + divergence events + hardening loop (R3) |

## What Must Be Preserved (Domain Intelligence)

| Loop Intelligence | Where It Lives in Template |
|---|---|
| Judge calibration (granularity dial → threshold/window) | `runtime_hints.judge.rubric` + `marginal_threshold` seeded from the real dial values (quick 3.0/1, balanced 2.0/2, exhaustive 1.0/3) |
| Dual-judge adjudication (assess + skeptic, TWO yeses for done) | `judge_samples: 3` median on terminal gates + forbidden-success-mode screen (R2c) |
| Judge ground-truth observation (`_observe_ground_truth`) | `tools_posture: verify` + `proof_command`/`validator_script` (R1) — the judge re-runs and re-reads, never trusts prose |
| Judge canary + judge_blind halt (`instrument.py`) | Template-save-time calibration probe + uncalibrated-judge halt (R3e) |
| Stagnation detection (streak counting, window N) | `loop{mode: until_dry{streak: N}}` — native node capability, N from the dial |
| Goal-type-specific exit | Template variant selection (verifiable/open/monitor) |
| Adaptive nudge prompts | Stage prompt references `{{last.output}}` and adapts |
| Classification | Preserved as the `workflow_plan` tool's template-matching step |
| Plan generation | Preserved as the planning meta-workflow (see UNIVERSAL-PROJECT-PLANNING.md) |
| Worker/supervisor dir symmetry (`effective_dir`) | Engine invariant: the judge/gate reads where the worker writes; code templates pin `cwd` + worktree explicitly |

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Coexistence (immediate)
- Loops keep running on their existing engine.
- New workflow templates are available as an ALTERNATIVE way to start projects.
- Users who create a "goal" from chat can choose: old loop or new workflow (the system offers both until the old is deprecated).
- **(R10a)** Legacy loop-kind identifiers and loop chat-tool names resolve to their workflow templates via read-time aliases in the live enum — zero migration code for years-old references; aliases are deleted only at the Phase-4 endgame.

### Phase 2: Feature Parity (after Slices 0-5 + this plan)
- All 5 template variants pass the same validation scenarios old loops handle.
- The "Projects" nav section shows BOTH active loops and active workflow runs.
- Dashboard ActiveWork widget aggregates both.
- **(R10c) Cockpit live-follow key equivalence** (checklist row): loop cockpit live-follow today keys per-loop SSE on `loop:<id>`; template-run sessions stream under derived run-scoped keys, and the cockpit/chat surface must treat them as the base container via key equivalence — strict-equality matching drops events (a proven FE regression class).
- **(R10b) Template metadata hygiene**: bundled templates pre-define only graph structure + judge wiring, never autonomy/model/retention policy (those stay per-run inputs); `<category>-<layout>-<style>` naming taxonomy is a rule; each template carries a typed doc block (WHEN-trigger description, keywords, stage anatomy, judge do/don'ts) validated at save time with a recorded validation signature — post-migration user edits surface a re-validate warning instead of silently breaking embedded judge calibration.

### Phase 3: Deprecation (6-12 months post-v2)
- New project creation defaults to workflows; loop creation moves to "Legacy" section.
- Existing running loops continue to completion.
- No forced migration of historical data.

**(R6) Retirement acceptance criteria — a template may not become the default replacement for its loop kind until:**

1. **Its judges actually reject sometimes.** Run Ledger evidence required; a gate with a 100% pass rate over N runs is statistical proof of a fake check — it blocks retirement and surfaces as a warning badge on the template (the nodding-loop detector).
2. **The five-moves audit passes.** Each of the 5 templates must show where each move — discovery / handoff / verification / persistence / scheduling — lives in its graph, or justify its absence. The five anti-patterns (nodding / amnesiac / manual / blind / tangled) become named template-lint rules run in CI.
3. **Every ported engine behavior carries provenance tags** (see checklist table): the failure mode it mitigates + the model era it was added — "every component encodes an assumption about what the model can't do" — enabling methodical ONE-AT-A-TIME retirement later (radical one-shot simplification is a documented failure; one-at-a-time worked).

### Phase 4: Retirement Endgame (explicit — "loops drain naturally" is not a plan)

Loops can be paused or long-lived indefinitely (goal loops have no expiry), so retirement of `loop/manager.py`, `loop/watchdog.py`, autonudge-as-loop-ticker, and the reserved loop agents (`RESERVED_AGENT_NAMES`, agents/defaults.py) cannot wait for the last loop to finish on its own. The endgame:

1. At Phase 3 + 90 days: paused/stagnant loops older than 30 days get a one-time migration offer (their plan + findings compiled into an equivalent workflow run via the template mapping, findings carried as prior context).
2. Any still-active loop past the deadline: auto-converted on next resume (same compilation), or archived-with-data if conversion fails validation.
3. Only then are the engine modules deleted. Historical loop rows stay readable (read-only archive view) — the DATA never migrates forcibly, only the EXECUTION.
4. **(R6 amendment) "Gate writes, never reads"**: at retirement, block new loop CREATION only; keep read/cancel/cockpit forever — retirement is non-destructive by construction.
5. **(R6 amendment) Proof artifacts for retirement**: each migrated engine behavior gets a claim-action-assertion-validated proof artifact (screenshot/ledger record) attached to the Run Ledger — the retirement acceptance criteria get a working evidence format.

### Migration Checklist — Behaviors That Must Not Silently Vanish

These loop-engine behaviors are baked into `gateway._fire`, the watchdog, and the subagent reaper — NOT into plan structure. Each row carries **(R6c) provenance tags**: the failure mode it mitigates + the model era it was added.

| Behavior | New Home | Mitigates / Era |
|---|---|---|
| Deliverable-forcing re-prompt (worker claims done but deliverable missing → re-prompt; `_MAX_CYCLE_REPROMPTS`) | Template-level: terminal `gate{verify_command\|expression}` + `retry{amend_prompt}` on the deliverable stage; actor-transition rule makes worker-declared done impossible anyway | Worker done-claims without artifacts / 2025 |
| Fresh-ACP-retry heuristic (hung ACP session → retry on a fresh one) | Engine-level: stage `retry` gains `fresh_session: true` + the full R7 protocol (structured 5-field handoff, repair-vs-restart, complete-or-block, liveness classification, executor_caps gating across the 3 ACP dialects, atomic clarification consumption, auto-persist-only-if-agent-didn't) | ACP agents no-op repeat prompts / 2025 |
| Loop `workflow_ids` force-injection (per-phase SOP guidance, context.py force-include) | Template stage prompts reference the migrated SOP-template content directly (TASKS-SOPS plan) | Workers forgetting standing procedure / 2025 |
| Autonudge idle-tick driving loop cycles | The v2 engine is tick-driven natively (engine scheduler + event ticks); autonudge returns to its original chat-idle job (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE absorbs it as `kind:idle`). Note: the loop engine's PURE tick core (`loop/tick.py`) ports only into code-project stage semantics — it was only ever the sdlc kind's brain | Sessions idling instead of continuing / 2025 |
| Judge ground-truth independence (`_observe_ground_truth` re-runs commands / reads artifacts) | **(R1)** No longer claimed "by construction" — enforced: `tools_posture: verify`, `proof_command`, `validator_script`, `hidden_validation_commands`, `forbidden_success_modes`, `ground_truth_sources`, judge isolation via SubagentManager, actor-based done-transition, proof-attachment precondition | Verifier theater + reward hacking / 2026 |
| Dual-judge adjudication (skeptic second opinion, TWO yeses) | **(R2)** `judge_samples: N` median (default 3 on terminal gates) + typed verdict enum {PASS, REJECT, REPLAN, ESCALATE, NEEDS_INPUT}, reasoning-before-verdict, constrained decoding, `cannot_judge` escape hatch | Single-judge noise + leniency drift / 2026 |
| Judge calibration (granularity dial, probe canary, judge_blind halt) | **(R3)** Rubric convergence contract + `stop_condition{consecutive_clean}` + free stuck detection off journal data + verdict ledger events (incl. `status=discard`) + judge-hardening loop (divergence events → few-shot exemplar patches) | Uncalibrated judges passing everything / 2025-26 |
| Stagnation/error windows + trust-TTL (watchdog `_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS`, `_MAX_TURN_SECS`, trust expiry → NEEDS_INPUT) | **(R4)** Engine circuit breaker (fingerprinting, trip at 3 identical failures, recoverable-class headroom) + escalation ladder + never-silence structured briefs; trust-TTL carries over as a run-level policy | Infinite fix loops (the #1 failure mode) / 2025 |
| Gateway auto-compaction within long turns | **(R13)** Reactive one-shot compaction + circuit breaker + proactive topic-segmented compression + typed carryover buckets + judge-boundary narration exclusion | Context overflow mid-iteration / 2025 |
| Guidance files + nudges.json mid-flight steering | **(R14)** Interrupt queue consumed at iteration boundaries + plan re-evaluation + judge-comment triage + per-project judge-prompt overrides | Cancel+restart as the only correction path / 2026 |
| Deterministic gates (`gates.py` tristate verify, audit screen) | **(R8)** Free rule tier before every judge + `fallback_check` beneath every judge + PASS-contradicts-deterministic auto-escalation + verification ladder ordering | Burning judge tokens on rule-solvable checks / 2025 |
| Boot recovery (`reap_orphaned_loops`, subagent `_reconcile_orphans`) | Engine run-reconciliation at startup: RUNNING runs re-arm, orphaned worker sessions tombstoned, self-created triggers (R15) survive via substrate persistence | Gateway restarts stranding runs / 2025 |

## Changes to WORKFLOWS-V2.md

1. **Binding syntax addition:** `{{last.output}}` inside a `loop` body refers to the previous iteration's output (already implied but must be explicit in the spec).
2. **`runtime_hints` field on WorkflowDef** — opaque dict with the two-group split (`judge` / `execution`), passed to stage prompt rendering via `{{defaults.runtime_hints.*}}`; the engine-enforced subset (judge-tier isolation, actor transitions, proof-attachment, WIP=1, expression success) documented as invariants, not hints.
3. **`tools_posture: verify`** — a third posture between `none` and `full`: read tools + declared-command execution, no writes (R1).
4. **Node fields**: `isolation: fresh | cross_model` on stages; `model_tier: deterministic | cheap | standard | judgment`; `success_when` expression; `when` conditional; `retry_route` classified-retry mapping.
5. **Gate kinds**: `gate{kind: judge}` with `judge_samples`; dual verify+guard config on `verify_command` gates; `fallback_check` on all judge/gate nodes.
6. **Loop-node middleware seam**: circuit breaker + escalation ladder + interrupt queue are engine features of the `loop` node (R4, R14).
7. **Run Ledger event types**: `judge_verdict` (with evidence chain + discard status), `judge_divergence`, `steering`, `breaker_trip`, `comment_triage`, `diagnosis`, `self_scheduled` — and the corresponding FE `RUN_LIFECYCLE` union additions.
8. **Add 8 loop-derived templates to Slice 6** (goal-pursuit-verifiable, goal-pursuit-open-ended, goal-pursuit-monitor, deep-research, code-project, design-project, general-project, diagnose).
9. **Tool surface**: `set_onetime_task` / `set_recurring_task` tool module (R15), registered via `mcp_core._TOOL_MODULES` + `tool_providers/registry.py`; trigger entities + resume-target wiring specified in AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE.

---

## Risks

- **Judge-hardening is iterative by nature** — expect 3-5 tuning rounds per template before divergence events quiet down; budget it, don't treat first-pass judge prompts as final (R3).
- **`tools_posture: verify` is a new privilege tier** — it must reuse the existing judge-session restriction pattern (no write tools, permission requests rejected) and the `audit_bash_command` screen on `proof_command` execution, or judges become an escalation path.
- **Judge sessions are subagent spawns** — they ride `SubagentManager` caps (`_MAX_CONCURRENT`/auto-sizing, memory gate, cwd validation). A run with per-cycle judges + parallel foreach could starve the pool; judge spawns should use the internal-secret `approval_mode="auto"` path and count against run-level, not global, concurrency where possible.
- **Self-scheduling (R15) is the one genuinely new power** — the bounds (count cap, TTL, provenance, autonomy gating) are load-bearing; ship them in the same slice as the tools, never after.
- **Alias layer (R10a) can mask drift** — aliases resolve names only; behavior parity is proven by the R6 acceptance gates, not by the alias resolving.

---

## Implementation Effort

- **5 sessions** (after Workflows v2 Slices 0-2 are complete; was 3 — the judge contract, engine middleware, and acceptance instrumentation absorb the added scope)
- **Session 1 — Judge contract + runtime_hints spec**: the two-group hints schema; `tools_posture: verify`; typed verdict enum + constrained decoding + parse-retry; judge isolation via SubagentManager + actor-transition + proof-attachment invariants; deterministic pre-tier + `fallback_check` (R1, R2, R8, R9). Engine unit tests: a worker cannot transition to done; a PASS without proof is invalid; PASS-contradicts-deterministic escalates.
- **Session 2 — Engine loop-node middleware**: circuit breaker + fingerprinting + escalation ladder + failure-class routing; fresh-session/lifecycle protocol + executor_caps; reactive/proactive compaction; interrupt queue + boundary consumption (R4, R7, R13, R14). New Run Ledger event types + FE `RUN_LIFECYCLE` additions.
- **Session 3 — Author the 8 template YAML specs** (R5 code-project restructure, R11 design/test/TDD content, R12 diagnose, R15 monitor self-scheduling incl. the trigger tools module + bounds config through the four wiring points) + integration tests that run each through the engine; verify `until_dry` + `progress_field` and judge-stage structured output reliability.
- **Session 4 — Calibration + acceptance instrumentation**: rubric contract + server-side score recomputation; verdict ledger + divergence events + hardening loop; template lint (five-moves audit, anti-pattern rules, self_judged warning, LLM-stage-doing-deterministic-work); nodding-loop detector + warning badge; save-time validation signature (R3, R6, R10b).
- **Session 5 — FE + coexistence**: template picker + "Start from template"; cockpit live-follow key equivalence (R10c); interrupt-queue + comment-triage UI; legacy alias layer (R10a); end-to-end validation of all 8 templates as-a-user.

## Success Criteria

1. Each of the 5 loop kinds' core scenarios can be expressed as a workflow template and runs to completion.
2. **No bundled judge is blind or captive**: every judge stage runs `tools_posture: verify` in an isolated session, re-runs its `proof_command`, and its PASS events carry cited proof artifacts (spot-check the Run Ledger).
3. **Judges reject sometimes**: over the parity-validation runs, every template's judge/gate shows at least one REJECT/REPLAN with evidence — a 100% pass rate blocks the template from becoming its kind's default (R6a).
4. The circuit breaker trips on a synthetic 3-identical-failure run without any LLM call, and escalation walks the ladder to a structured needs-input brief (R4).
5. A "research a topic" workflow produces findings of equivalent quality to the old Research Loop, with claims verified by a cross-model judge.
6. A "build a feature" workflow passes the init-gate, holds WIP=1, and classifies a seeded regression vs a pre-existing failure via the baseline diff (R5).
7. The monitor variant parks between checks via a self-created trigger (visible in the cockpit with provenance + TTL) instead of burning counted cycles, and survives a gateway restart (R15).
8. Mid-flight steering works: an interrupt queued during a running research workflow is consumed at the next iteration boundary and visibly re-ranks the plan; an accepted judge comment reaches the worker session (R14).
9. Mid-flight editing works (user pauses a running research workflow, edits the synthesis prompt, resumes; edited template surfaces the re-validate warning).
10. The five-moves audit + anti-pattern lint pass in CI for all 8 bundled templates (R6b).
11. The template picker correctly suggests `code-project` for coding intents and `deep-research` for research intents; legacy loop-kind names resolve via aliases (R10a).

## Execution log

- **2026-08-01 — DONE — Judge contract + runtime_hints + enforcement invariants (session 29 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-loops-judge`, PR #167. `workflows/judge_contract.py` (closed verdict enum
  PASS/REJECT/REPLAN/ESCALATE/NEEDS_INPUT, rubric ratchet with strict-no-averaging,
  engine-computed overall, forbidden-mode denylist, N-sample median aggregation),
  `judge_pretier.py` (the free rule tier that runs before any judge model call — never issues a
  PASS — plus the tristate `fallback_check`), `judge_actors.py` (the actor-transition invariant:
  a worker may never reach `done`; judge isolation incl. cross-family refusal; provenance
  blinding; narration-excluding evidence assembly). `runtime_hints` added to `WorkflowDef`
  (opaque to the core, parsed leniently to the STRICT default by `hints_from_dict`). 11379 tests.

- **DISCOVERY — the forbidden-mode denylist shipped inert in its first form.** Requiring every
  long word of a mode phrase to be present missed the phrasing a judge actually produces
  ("test deleted or skipped" lists alternatives). Two-of-N stemmed-signal matching + two-signal
  default phrasings; verified 6/6 real admissions caught, 4/4 innocent clean.

- **DEVIATION — `loop/judge.py` is not unified.** LOOPS-EVOLUTION converges loops onto v2 in its
  own slices; unifying the existing loop judge pre-emptively would be wasted motion. This session
  builds the template-world contract that must MEET OR EXCEED the loop judge's bar (which it does:
  isolation, independent proof re-run, dual/median adjudication, verify-command tier).

- **NOT DONE (queue split):** the engine loop-node middleware (breaker, fingerprinting, escalation
  ladder, failure-class routing, fresh-session protocol, interrupt queue) is session 30; the 8
  template specs are session 31. This session is the enforcement primitives they consume.

- **Real-model validated** through the live dev gateway (Bedrock, claude-sonnet-5): a real verdict
  came back correctly shaped and REJECTED thin evidence unprompted; the contract then caught both
  a rubber-stamp (same zero scores flipped to PASS) and a deterministic contradiction (PASS vs
  failed check → escalate).

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Engine loop-node middleware (session 30 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-loops-middleware`. `workflows/loop_middleware.py`: 7-way failure
  classification, tool-argument fingerprinting, the Continue→Nudge→Escalate→Halt ladder with
  per-class entry rungs, recoverable-class headroom (no rung burned on a 429), the structured
  never-silence brief, and the atomic interrupt queue. 4 new ledger kinds registered in the FE
  `RUN_LIFECYCLE` union with a bidirectional drift test. 11442 tests, full FE gate green.

- **DISCOVERY — two dead-configuration bugs in my own first cut, both caught by measuring the walk.**
  (1) Every non-classified-retry rung mapped to HALT, making the ladder's middle unreachable — fixed
  with a distinct ESCALATE action. (2) `attempt_cap` applied as a ladder-POSITION cap made
  `restart_from_scratch` unreachable under the plan's own values — fixed by counting attempts within
  a rung. A rung that can never be selected reads as a working feature; only walking the whole ladder
  exposes it.

- **DEVIATION — built on top of `resilience.check_breaker`, not replacing it.** The Slice-2c breaker
  already catches four stalls; this adds only the tiers needing more than counters.

- **NOT DONE — the middleware is a pure decision layer, not yet wired into the `RunController` tick.**
  That wiring (plus the R7 fresh-session lifecycle protocol and R13 reactive compaction, which needs
  the absent summarizer seam) is the live-engine integration those consume. Validated in isolation on
  a full simulated stall sequence.

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — The loop-kind templates (session 31 of the WF2 queue).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-loops-templates`. Five new bundled templates with `runtime_hints` and the
  judge contract wired in: `goal-pursuit-open-ended`, `goal-pursuit-verifiable`, `general-project`,
  `design-project`, `diagnose-run`. 132 structural integration tests; the pre-existing bundled
  convention suite extended 6 → 11 templates. Verified through the live API and in a built wheel.

- **DEVIATION — five templates, not eight.** `deep-research` (the research-loop descendant) already
  ships from Slice 9a. `goal-pursuit-monitor` is NOT BUILDABLE: its design rests on
  `set_onetime_task` / `set_recurring_task`, which belong to AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE and do not exist
  anywhere in the tree — shipping it would mean a template whose central mechanism silently
  no-ops. `code-project` is deferred as a product decision: it overlaps the shipped
  `code-implementation`, and choosing between replacing that or adding a second beside it is not a
  mechanical port.

- **PREMISE MISMATCH — the plan's YAML uses three spec forms the engine does not have.**
  `{{defaults.runtime_hints.*}}` is not a valid binding root (only inputs/nodes/item/iter/last);
  a gate's kind is `config.kind`, not `gate_kind`; an `until` loop needs `config.condition`, not
  `config.until`. Rubrics are inlined into judge prompts instead, with a test asserting every
  declared criterion actually reaches a judge.

- **DISCOVERY — my own `design-project` shipped without a judge,** exiting its refinement loop on a
  self-reported `issues_resolved` — precisely the "no agent certifies its own work" rule this plan
  names as the platform's oldest. Caught by the structural test suite written in the same session.

- **DISCOVERY — `continue_on_error` is not an engine key.** I invented it; the bundled action-arg
  guard caught it. The real form is `allow_failure` inside `with`.

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — Calibration + acceptance instrumentation (session 32).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-loops-calibration`. `workflows/judge_calibration.py`: the verdict ledger
  (discarded iterations included), divergence records with a typed direction, the nodding-loop
  detector with a generous minimum sample, free stuck detection, the judge canary sharing
  `loop/instrument`'s threshold, and hardening-loop exemplars ordered dangerous-direction-first.
  Six anti-pattern lint rules + the five-moves audit in `template_lint.py`. 11697 tests.

- **DISCOVERY — five false positives from my own first draft of the anti-pattern rules,** every one
  on the shipped library and none a real template defect: `{{nodes.}}` is cross-iteration state;
  `refuted: boolean` routes as well as `verdict`; `infer` nodes have no tools by definition;
  `streak` alone is a valid until_dry exit and a bound `max_iterations` is a valid cap; and
  verifiers exist under the names `verify_refute`, `completeness_critic` and `round_gaps`. All
  fixed at the rule; `KNOWN_ANTI_PATTERNS` is empty and a test keeps it that way.

- **DISCOVERY — I nearly recorded one of those as a genuine defect,** complete with a reasoned
  exemption, and the self-check test written alongside it is what disproved it. The plausible
  write-up was the risk, not the rule.

- **NOT DONE — the calibration is not wired into the run path.** Nothing emits `judge_verdict` /
  `judge_divergence` yet; the kinds are registered and the FE union knows them (session 30), but the
  emit points sit in the controller tick and the human-override UI, which is session 33. The
  save-time `probe_judge` hook is deferred deliberately: a model call on the save path is a latency
  decision, not a detail.

- **2026-08-01 — CODE DONE (push blocked) — FE + coexistence (session 33).**
  Branch `feature-wf2-loops-fe`. `workflows/loop_aliases.py` (read-time legacy-kind aliases, one-way,
  every alias asserted against a shipped template) + cockpit stream-key equivalence (the R10c silent
  event-drop fix), mirrored in `web/src/pages/workflows/containerKey.ts` with a backend↔FE drift
  test. R14 steering endpoints (`/steer`, `/steering`) queued on the run and consumed at the
  iteration boundary. Alias manifest surfaced through `/api/workflows/manifest`. 11750 tests, full FE
  gate green.

- **DISCOVERY — a test of mine leaked a run into the REAL home.** The fixture patched the loader's
  `config_dir` but `store.py` binds it at module level, so `store.save()` wrote to
  `~/.gideon/workflows/runs.db`; the leak surfaced three files away as a memory-smoke failure
  because a live run prepends `[ACTIVE WORKFLOWS]` to every built message. Root-caused, the stray row
  removed, the fixture fixed to patch `store.config_dir` directly.

- **DEVIATION — the run-path wiring is not done, and that is the honest back half of this session.**
  The steering queue is stored and surfaced but the tick loop does not consume it; the template
  picker's data (aliases + manifest) exists but the widget does not; `keysEquivalent` exists but the
  cockpit still compares raw keys. All three sit above the same controller-tick seam that sessions 30
  and 32 also stopped at, and wiring the three decision layers into the live run in one coherent
  change is better than three half-integrations. The as-a-user validation of all 8 templates is
  bounded by the same gap.

### S144 — the free rule tier runs before the LLM judge (criterion 2)

**DONE.** LOOPS-EVOLUTION criterion 2 requires that "no bundled judge is blind or captive", and §judge
is explicit that **a free rule tier runs BEFORE any LLM judge call** — mechanical length, failure-
pattern regex, structural pre-checks, existence — so "anything rule-solvable never reaches the
probabilistic model. Loop judges run every cycle — this is the single biggest token saver in the plan."

`judge_pretier.run_pretier` implements exactly that tier and **shipped in session 30 with no caller**
(AST-verified: zero production importers outside its own module + tests — this was the finding the
2026-08-04 header audit recorded). So the saver did not exist: measured against the live `GateKind.JUDGE`
dispatcher, an empty artifact, a whitespace artifact and a `TODO: implement` stub all reached the
reasoning-tier judge and each spent a completion on output there was provably nothing to judge.

**Wired at the gate, opt-in via an `evidence` binding.** `dispatch_gate` now runs
`_judge_pretier_screen(cfg)` before the model call; a rule-solvable rejection short-circuits to a
REJECT `NodeResult` carrying the pre-tier's `failure_class` (`empty_output` / `stubbed_output` /
`worker_gave_up` / `tool_error`) so the escalation ladder routes on WHY it failed rather than
re-deriving it. Adopted in five bundled templates whose deliverable node is unambiguous:
goal-pursuit-open-ended (`accept`), knowledge-lint (`detail-preserved`), knowledge-synthesis
(`grounded`), publish-article (`accuracy-held`), thesis-tracker (`falsifiable`).

**DEVIATION — additive, not the whole cluster.** The plan's back half is "wire the three decision
layers into the live run in one coherent session" (`loop_middleware`, `judge_calibration`, and this
pre-tier). This session took ONLY the pre-tier, deliberately: `loop_middleware`'s breaker is
**redundant with the shipped `resilience.check_breaker`** the RunController already consults every
iteration (criterion 4's LLM-free 3-identical trip is met), so wiring `check_middleware` wholesale
would be a dual path — a clean-break violation, not a fix. The pre-tier is the one layer that is both
inert AND non-redundant, and it is atomically completable without touching the controller. Calibration
(`judge_verdict`/`judge_divergence` emission) and the middleware/steering consumption remain the
genuine back half; they are recorded here as the next Loops-Evolution slice, not silently folded in.

**Two guards that keep it additive, each measured:**

* **No `evidence` key → no screen.** Every judge shipped before this binds no evidence; the mechanical
  length check would otherwise see empty text and reject a working gate as "under 20 chars — nothing
  to judge". Driven: a no-evidence judge reaches the model exactly as before (1 call, DONE).
* **The existence gate defaults OFF** unless the template supplies an `evidence_*` count. A text-only
  judge must not be failed for producing zero commits; it engages only when the author asked for it.

Verified load-bearing by removing the screen call and confirming the rejection tests go red. Gate:
`make lint` (black+isort+flake8+mypy, 691 files) green; `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` **16082 passed,
29 skipped, 13 xfailed**. No `web/` change. 8 new tests in `tests/test_workflows_engine.py`.

- **REMAINING in LOOPS-EVOLUTION:** the middleware/steering run-path consumption (criteria 3/8) and
  calibration emission + assessment (`judge_verdict`/`judge_divergence`, criterion feeding R6a) — the
  honest back half this session did not take, plus the 3 templates deferred at session 33 and the
  `code-project` product decision.

### S145 — `judge_samples` was declared and read by nothing (criterion 2 / R6a)

**DONE.** `goal-pursuit-open-ended`'s terminal `accept` gate carries `judge_samples: 3`, and its own
prompt explains why to the model: *"three independent samples of you are being asked — a single
judgement on a terminal accept was measured to be indistinguishable from noise."* The gate read the
key **not at all**. Measured before writing a line:

```
judge_samples=3, model returns PASS, REJECT, REJECT
  -> model_calls=1  state=done  output={'verdict': 'PASS'}
```

**A 1-of-3 PASS accepted the run.** The majority verdict the template paid for never happened, and the
template's own stated reason for sampling — that one judgement is noise — described the behaviour it
was actually getting. `judge_contract.aggregate_samples` ships the exact median rule (any escalation
wins; majority pass; else majority reject) and was **also uncalled**, so both halves existed and
nothing connected them. This is the same declared-but-unread shape as S144's pre-tier, one config key
over.

**The rule is shared; the TYPE deliberately is not.** `aggregate_samples` types on
`judge_contract.Verdict` (PASS/REJECT/REPLAN/ESCALATE/NEEDS_INPUT) while this gate speaks
`verify.Verdict` (PASS/RETRY/ESCALATE/REJECT) — measured, they differ in three members. Importing the
aggregator and feeding it gate verdicts would be **exactly** the cross-vocabulary defect S130 found in
the fail-mode classifier, where a set of cap keys was compared against gate names and every gate read
"closed". So `_aggregate_gate_verdicts` restates the documented rule over the gate's own enum, and the
docstring names the reason so a future reader does not "simplify" it back into a shared import.

The split rule needed a decision the contract does not cover: this gate has a RETRY the contract
lacks. A RETRY/REJECT split resolves to **REJECT**, because a REJECT stops and asks while a RETRY
spins — the safe reading of a split is the one that does not loop.

**DISCOVERY — my own first draft under-counted tokens 3×.** With sampling wired, the result still
reported `_estimate_tokens` for the LAST sample: a 3-sample gate read 22 tokens where it had spent
~66. That silently un-binds the loop breaker's `max_tokens` and the run cost cap **exactly** on the
path sampling makes most expensive. A meter that reads low on the expensive path is worse than no
meter, because the cap stops binding without ever saying so. Now summed over every sample, asserted
(`three.tokens == one.tokens * 3`).

Two guards keep it additive: an absent or invalid `judge_samples` floors to **1** (pre-S145 behaviour
— a gate that never asked for sampling must not start paying for it), and the count clamps at
`MAX_JUDGE_SAMPLES = 5` so an author typo (`judge_samples: 30`) cannot quietly cost 30× on a gate that
runs every loop iteration. An unparseable sample fails the whole gate where it stands rather than
deciding from the 2 that parsed — a terminal accept decided from 2 of 3 is a quieter version of the
single-sample bug this session fixes.

Verified load-bearing: forcing `samples = 1` turns 7 of the 14 new tests red. Gate: `make lint`
(black+isort+flake8+mypy, 691 files) green; `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` **16096 passed, 29 skipped,
13 xfailed**. No `web/` change.

- **STILL REMAINING in LOOPS-EVOLUTION** (unchanged by this session): the middleware/steering
  run-path consumption (`loop_middleware` is redundant with the shipped `resilience.check_breaker`, so
  it needs a de-duplication decision, not a wiring), calibration emission + assessment (dead at BOTH
  ends — nothing emits `judge_verdict` and R6a's default-promotion path does not exist), the 3
  templates deferred at session 33, and the `code-project` product decision.

### S146 — `isolation: cross_model` is unenforceable, and now it says so (R1)

**DONE.** `judge_contract.Isolation` offers two levels, and the audit found they are **not equally
real**:

* **`fresh` is satisfied BY CONSTRUCTION.** A judge gate runs through `one_shot_completion`, which
  builds a temporary instance rather than reusing the worker's session — so the worker's reasoning
  trace is not in its context. Nothing to enforce, nothing to warn about.
* **`cross_model` has NO SEAM.** Measured: `dispatch_gate` receives `(node, ctx, now, verify,
  completion, tiers, mode)` and is **never told the producing stage's model**, and
  `one_shot_completion` accepts a `use_case`, not a model — so there is no argument through which a
  different model FAMILY could be demanded. `judge_actors.plan_judge_session` and
  `validate_judge_model` implement the family comparison in full and have **no caller**.

So a template asking for the strongest independence claim in the contract would silently receive the
weaker one — the anti-rubber-stamping option, reading as satisfied.

**Caught BEFORE it shipped, which is the useful part.** No bundled template declares `cross_model`
today (all judges say `isolation: fresh` — verified against every shipped `workflow.json`). But the
plan specifies `judge_isolation: cross_model` twice for templates that are still unbuilt: the
deep-research template ("claims verified by a different model family") and `code-project`. Without
this rule, the first of those to land would have shipped the claim quietly meaning fresh-session only.

**DEVIATION — the honest fix here is a LINT, not enforcement.** Cross-family selection needs the
worker's model threaded into the gate and a completion seam that accepts a model rather than a
use-case; both are real plumbing this session did not have. Inventing a cross-family choice through a
seam with no model argument would produce exactly the inert control this program keeps finding — a
check that runs, reports independence, and cannot deliver it. So `WFL_UNENFORCEABLE_ISOLATION` makes
the gap loud at authoring time and `plan_judge_session` stays ready for the day the plumbing lands.

**A WARNING, not an error**, for two reasons: the declaration is aspirational rather than wrong, and
the shipped library is held to `clean` — an error would block a template for asking for something
better than it can get. A companion test asserts no shipped template makes the claim, so the two
directions are pinned together: `test_every_judge_is_isolated_and_read_only` asserts the positive
(`fresh`), and `test_no_shipped_template_declares_an_unenforceable_isolation` asserts the negative.

**A correction I made mid-session, worth recording.** My first probe reported that
`goal-pursuit-open-ended` declared `cross_model`. It does not — it declares `fresh`; I had read a
stale value from an enum dump rather than the template. Re-measuring against the real JSON (and
against `origin/main`) is what turned this from "a shipped template is lying" into "a future template
would have". The rule is the same either way; the queue row would have been false.

Verified load-bearing: removing the rule turns the flagging test red. Gate: `make lint`
(black+isort+flake8+mypy, 691 files) green; `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` **16105 passed, 29 skipped,
13 xfailed**. No `web/` change.

- **STILL REMAINING in LOOPS-EVOLUTION:** cross-model isolation ENFORCEMENT (needs the worker model
  threaded into `dispatch_gate` + a model-accepting completion seam — a real plumbing session, and the
  reason this one shipped a lint); the middleware/steering run-path consumption (`loop_middleware` is
  redundant with the shipped `resilience.check_breaker`, so it needs a de-duplication decision);
  calibration emission + assessment (dead at BOTH ends); the 3 templates deferred at session 33; and
  the `code-project` product decision.
