# DURABILITY-AND-SYNC

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/DAS.md`](../atomic/DAS.md) as 10 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Durability & Sync — Deterministic Shards, Scheduled Snapshots, User-Owned Transport

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — Session 1 (inventory + audit) and Session 2 (2a shards / 2b service / 2c
settings surface) shipped 2026-07-27/29: deterministic shards + `backup export|validate`, the
boot-started snapshot service, tiered retention, restore drills, and the Backups settings panel.
**Remaining in S2:** the restore endpoint (`POST /api/durability/restore` does not exist) and the
T2-M1/M2/M3 merge path — `--mode merge` exists on the CLI but **NOTHING reads `StateEntry.merge`**, so
the inventory-driven dispatch is unbuilt. 🔴 Also: **`audit_home()` has zero runtime callers**
(test-only), so the claims-everything guard is inert and `model_calls.jsonl`/`spend.json` remain
unclaimed by any snapshot or export. Sessions 3-5 (sync core, transports, time travel) not started.

## Research Integration (2026-07-12)

Approved recommendation set folded in (mechanism-level, not appendix):

- **NEW-4** — durable state backup + multi-machine sync core (JSONL shards + SHA manifest + validate; pull→merge-import→export-union→push; boot-started scheduled self-backup with rolling backups + restore endpoints; git-versioned memory snapshots; encrypted-intents crypto for machine exchange) → §1, §2, §3, §4, §7
- **NEW-4.a** — workspace-level adaptive-debounce git auto-commits on config/skills/memory/projects + rollback/revert/preview UI panel → §5
- **NEW-4.b** — user-facing export/import/archive-restore endpoints (DSAR-shaped portability safety net) → §6
- **NEW-4.c** — multi-machine sync over plain shared storage (S3/local-FS) via manifest + versioned registry + mtime-fingerprint refresh + sha-conflict detection with propose-only LLM merge on divergent edits → §4

## Overview

Gideon's soul is the state it accumulates: **memory** (the harness's own internals — facts, facets, episodic, procedural, lessons in `memory.db`), **knowledge** (the user's personal items — documents, files, photos, notes in `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`), tasks, projects, skills, prompts, workflows, agents, apps, config, and the run ledger. That distinction is load-bearing throughout this plan (user directive): *knowledge* names the knowledge store; *memory* names the harness subsystem — the shard inventory, sync rules, and UI never conflate them.

Today that state has a partial, manual, single-shot durability story — and this very project has already lost a memory directory once (2026-07-02). This plan makes durability boring: every byte of state is (1) enumerated in one inventory, (2) exportable as deterministic, human-diffable, validatable shards, (3) snapshotted on a schedule with rolling retention and periodic restore drills, (4) syncable across machines through transports the *user* owns (a git repo, a synced folder, an rsync target, an S3 bucket), and (5) recoverable through first-class restore endpoints — not archaeology.

**Soul guardrails:** single user, plain local files, no server component of ours anywhere in the sync path (the shared store is dumb storage with insert-only semantics — zero server logic). Human-diffable Git history of what the assistant knows is itself a trust feature. Anything intelligent in the pipeline (conflict merge) *proposes* — it never silently writes.

### Starting points (verified against code, 2026-07-12 recon)

The design builds on what actually exists — not the idealized versions the approved recommendation assumed:

- **Snapshot/portability coverage is PARTIAL — closing that gap is work item #1.** `snapshot.py` covers only `VALID_COMPONENTS = (memory, crons, config, skills, workspace, notifications, security)` over `CORE_FILES` (memory.db, memory_index.db, crons.json, config.json, session_map.json, hooks.json, project_dir, workspace_dir, notifications.jsonl, sel_hmac.key, telemetry_salt) plus the workspace/plan_memory/skills trees. **Neither snapshot nor export covers `tasks/`, `projects/`, `entity_settings/`, `loop/`, `artifacts/`, `prompts/`, `workflows/`, `apps/`, `agents/`** (recon gotcha #10). There is no "everything" component. A plan claiming "full-state backup" via today's tools is wrong.
- **`knowledge.db` is snapshotted UNSAFELY today.** It lives at `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db` (verified: `knowledge/__init__.py:knowledge_db_path`), inside the `workspace` tree that `snapshot_main` copies via `_copytree_safe` — a raw file copy of a live WAL sqlite database (`-wal`/`-shm` sidecars present on disk). Only the CORE_FILES `*.db` entries go through the sqlite backup API. Fixing this (backup-API copy for *every* sqlite file, discovered by extension, not by allowlist) ships in Slice 1.
- **Good machinery to reuse, not rebuild:** `snapshot_main` already does WAL checkpoint, sqlite `backup()` API for core DBs, `_data_filter` (rejects traversal/symlinks/hardlinks), atomic tmp-tar rename, 0600 chmod (the tar contains `sel_hmac.key`), `--keep` pruning, and merge helpers (`_merge_memory` — ATTACH + INSERT OR IGNORE over a 4-table allowlist; `_merge_crons` by job name; `_merge_notifications`). `portability.py` has zip export/import with `EXPORT_EXCLUDE` (.env, .local_secret, sel_hmac.key, telemetry_salt, session_map.json, pid files), traversal-safe `validate_import_zip` (MANIFEST v1|2), and merge/replace apply. Both are **manual and single-shot** — no scheduler calls either.
- **Restore refuses while the gateway runs** (`_is_gateway_running`, snapshot.py:554). Replace-restore keeps that invariant; merge-import can run live (it already reuses the merge helpers the dashboard import path uses).
- **Store conventions shape the shard design:** `atomic_write` (mkstemp + `os.replace`) is THE write convention for every JSON store; fcntl flock via `single_flight(job_key)` (concurrency.py) is the overlap guard; sqlite is used ONLY for memory (`memory.db`, `memory_index.db`) and knowledge (`knowledge.db`) — everything else is per-entity JSON files with no cross-file transaction. So most of the store is *already* entity-sharded; the exporter folds files into JSONL rows rather than inventing a new schema.
- **There is no sync provider type.** `PROVIDER_TYPES` (apps/manifest.py:914) = {model, agent, task, channel, inbox, skills, knowledge, memory, notification, tool, workflow, search, action, prompt}, and it MUST equal the runtime `_TypeHandler` set (`test_manifest_types_match_handlers` guards the #47 bug class). Adding `sync` means adding **both sides together** (§ Plug-in Map). *(Correction 2026-08-19: this bullet is now HISTORY — `sync` was added on both sides and the set is 19 types, adding `duty_gate`, `sandbox`, `sync`, `trigger` and `trigger_source`. And the guard it cites did not exist when this was written: the named test was a promise in five source comments and eighteen docs, and the 19 = 19 equality held by luck until it was written.)*
- **Egress:** `net.fetch` policies cap bodies at 5-10MB (STRICT/CONNECTOR). Backup shards can exceed that; the S3 transport derives a named `SYNC` `EgressPolicy` profile via `egress_policy_for()` rather than hand-rolling aiohttp (recon rule: never hand-roll for attacker-influenceable hosts).
- **The "memory dir lost" incident** the recommendation cites was a markdown memory workspace, not a sqlite store. The hourly git-versioned snapshot in this plan therefore covers the *memory markdown tree* (`workspace/memory` + `workspace/_ext/<cwd-slug>` partitions) alongside memory.db shard exports — not a nonexistent standalone "memory dir".
- **`triggers.json` does not exist yet** — background stores today are `crons.json` / `hooks.json` / `event_triggers.json` / `autonudge.json`. The inventory (§1) covers what exists; when AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE unifies them, the inventory line item swaps (that plan's step 9 already owns updating snapshot coverage for `triggers.json`).

---

## 1. The State Inventory — one manifest of everything that matters

One module, `durability/inventory.py`, is the single source of truth for "what is Gideon's state." Every other piece of this plan (snapshot, shard export, sync, portability, drills) iterates the inventory instead of maintaining its own allowlist — the CORE_FILES-drift bug class dies here.

Each inventory entry declares:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class StateEntry:
    id: str            # "tasks", "projects", "memory_db", "knowledge_db", "skills", ...
    kind: str          # json_entity_dir | json_file | jsonl_append | sqlite | tree
    path: str          # relative to config_dir()
    domain: str        # memory | knowledge | work | automation | platform | config
    secret: bool       # NEVER leaves the machine (sel_hmac.key, .env, .local_secret, telemetry_salt)
    derived: bool      # index/cache — excluded from shards, rebuilt on import
                       # (memory_index.db, memory.faiss, memory.ids.json, knowledge FTS,
                       #  skills/.skill_embeddings.json, __pycache__, WAL/SHM sidecars)
    merge: str         # union_by_id | lww_by_updated_at | append_dedup | sqlite_attach_ignore | replace_only
    tombstones: bool   # entity kinds that need delete markers to survive sync (tasks, projects)
```

**Inventory contents (the gap closure).** Everything `CORE_FILES` has today PLUS the uncovered stores: `tasks/` (incl. `task_lists/`, `_comments_*`), `projects/` (project.json + `context/`; `worktrees/` excluded as derived/git-owned), `entity_settings/`, `loop/`, `prompts/`, `prompt_snippets/`, `workflows/`, `agents/`, `apps/` (installed copies — `data/` config is state; code trees are re-installable and marked `derived` with a recorded source ref), `subagents/`, `folders.json`, `active_models.json`, `active_search_providers.json`, `active_prompts.json`, `extensions/` (instances + use_case_settings), `artifacts/`, `sessions/` (JSONL, year-sharded), `crons.json`/`hooks.json`/`event_triggers.json`/`autonudge.json`, `workspace/` (memory markdown, knowledge/ incl. knowledge.db + files/, lexicon, plan_memory). The `domain` field keeps **memory** entries (memory.db, workspace/memory, plan_memory) and **knowledge** entries (knowledge.db, knowledge files, lexicon) distinct end-to-end — filters, UI grouping, and sync scopes all key on it.

`snapshot.py`'s `VALID_COMPONENTS`/`CORE_FILES` become projections of the inventory (component = domain), gaining an `everything` component for free. `portability.py`'s `EXPORT_EXCLUDE` becomes `secret=True ∪ derived=True`. A unit test asserts every file/dir found under `config_dir()` is claimed by exactly one inventory entry or an explicit ignore list — new stores can't silently dodge backup again.

---

## 2. Deterministic Shard Format — JSONL + SHA manifest + `validate`

The authoritative, syncable, human-diffable representation of state (birdclaw's proven design: "SQLite is just a fast local index built from the shards"):

- **Layout:** `shards/<entry-id>/…` — per-entity-family JSONL files. Entity dirs fold to one row per entity file (`{"id": "t-3fa2b1c9", "data": {…}}`), rows **sorted by id**, canonical JSON (sorted keys, LF, UTF-8) so identical state always produces byte-identical shards. Append-only stores (sessions, notifications) shard by year (`sessions/2026.jsonl`); rows with unparseable timestamps land in `unknown.jsonl`, never backdated. Files >48MiB deterministically split into `part-NNNN` (no LFS needed when the transport is git).
- **sqlite export:** `memory.db` rows dump per-table to JSONL through the sqlite backup API snapshot (starting from `_merge_memory`'s existing 4-table allowlist: semantic_memory, episodic_memories, memory_events, knowledge_facts/edges — extended to the full schema), stable-ordered by rowid/id. `knowledge.db` likewise (items, sources, edges; the `files/` originals ride as a content-addressed blob dir keyed by sha256, deduplicated). Indexes are `derived` — **excluded and rebuilt on import** (FTS, faiss + ids.json, embedding caches).
- **Manifest:** `manifest.json` pins schema version, `generated_at`, `machine_id` (a new stable per-machine id file — NOT `telemetry_salt`, which is a secret), and per-shard `{bytes, rows, sha256}`.
- **Tombstones:** entity kinds with `tombstones=True` write `{"id": …, "deleted_at": …}` rows on delete (a small write-path hook in the native task/project stores) so sync deletion survives the union merge instead of resurrecting (lifeGLANCE's tombstone-before-delete).
- **`gideon backup validate`:** manifest well-formed → every shard exists → bytes/rows/sha match → every row parses → sqlite dumps re-import cleanly into a scratch DB. Non-zero exit for CI/cron use. This is also the restore-drill core (§3).
- **Writer discipline:** shard writes use `atomic_write`/`atomic_write_bytes`; the whole export runs under `single_flight("shard-export")`; deterministic id backfills never bump `updated_at` (the fleet-churn lesson).

Secrets (`secret=True`) are **never sharded**. Local snapshot tars keep including `sel_hmac.key` (with the existing 0600 discipline) because a same-machine restore needs it; shards are the *leaves-the-machine* representation and follow export rules.

---

## 3. Snapshot Service — scheduled, rolling, drilled

A boot-started background service (`durability/service.py`, started from `dashboard/server.py` startup alongside the extension loader — same pattern as the inbox retention loop), replacing "manual and single-shot":

- **Schedule:** default nightly full snapshot (the existing tar.gz path, now inventory-driven so it actually covers everything) + hourly incremental shard export of dirty entries (mtime-fingerprint per inventory entry — export only what changed). The **memory markdown tree and memory.db shards additionally commit hourly into a local git repo** (`~/.gideon/backups/state-history/`, plain `git` via subprocess) — the direct mitigation for the 2026-07-02 loss: an hour is the maximum blast radius, and `git log` over shards is the human-diffable "what did the assistant learn this week" view. Overlap guarded by `single_flight("snapshot")`; job timing rides the existing schedule machinery until AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE lands, then converts to `created_by: system:durability:*` triggers with deterministic ids (that plan's idempotent-re-registration rule).
- **Rolling retention:** `keep` generalized — N nightly + M weekly + Y monthly, pruned oldest-first (extends the existing `--keep` logic).
- **Restore endpoints:** `POST /api/durability/restore {snapshot_id, mode: merge|replace, components?, confirm: true}` + `GET /api/durability/snapshots`. Merge runs live (reusing `_do_merge`/`_merge_*`); replace stages the snapshot and keeps the refuse-while-gateway-runs invariant — the endpoint schedules the swap for next boot (staged dir + marker file the startup path applies before opening stores), mirroring the app-update `.rollback` staging pattern. Every restore writes the existing `pre-restore-<ts>` escape hatch first.
- **Restore drills (trust is a tested property):** a monthly drill job restores the latest snapshot into a temp dir, runs `backup validate`, opens each sqlite copy with `PRAGMA integrity_check`, diffs manifest row counts against the live store, and reports PASS/FAIL through `DashboardState.notify` (kind `warning` on failure — ranks above quiet-hours info suppression). A backup that has never been restored is a hope, not a backup. Drills never touch the live store.
- All snapshot/restore/drill/prune operations write SEL audit events (`sel.py`), as snapshot already does today.

## 4. Sync — user-owned transports as pluggable providers

Multi-machine sync = the shard representation (§2) + a dumb shared store + a deterministic merge. **No Gideon server anywhere**: the shared store only ever needs "write these objects" and "list/read objects" — insert-only semantics (lifeGLANCE's zero-server-logic doctrine, re-grounded onto plain storage per amendment NEW-4.c; the "batch/list endpoints" of the original research become append-object + list-prefix operations on the store).

### 4.1 The sync cycle (birdclaw's proven loop)

`pull → merge-import remote rows → export local union → push`, per the inventory's `merge` strategy:

- `union_by_id` for entity dirs (rows only one side has are preserved), `lww_by_updated_at` per entity for divergent same-id rows *below* the conflict threshold, `append_dedup` for JSONL streams (stable event ids make re-import a no-op), `sqlite_attach_ignore` for memory/knowledge DBs (the existing `_merge_memory` mechanism, generalized), tombstone-aware everywhere `tombstones=True`.
- **Versioned registry:** `registry.json` at the sync root records per-machine `{machine_id, seq, last_export_at, manifest_sha}`. Push = write shards under `machines/<machine_id>/seq-NNNN/` + CAS-update the registry (compare-and-swap on the prior sha; on registry race, re-pull and retry — insert-only object writes are idempotent, so retries are free).
- **mtime-fingerprint refresh + staleness window:** read paths pull+merge only when the last remote check exceeds `stale_after_secs` (default 900, per-process memo — no store roundtrip per operation); every local export triggers a push afterward. Remote listing cached by mtime/etag fingerprint so polls are cheap.
- **Durable outbox:** pending pushes queue in `~/.gideon/sync/outbox/` with per-target status `pending|delivered|given-up` and typed deliverer outcomes `delivered|transient|permanent` (unexpected throw = transient, never drop); the pull cursor advances **only on consumed rows** — prerequisite-absent holds the drain, payload-bad advances+logs. One target giving up never blocks others.
- **Indexes rebuilt on import**, never synced (FTS/faiss/embedding caches are `derived`).

### 4.2 Conflict handling — deterministic first, propose-don't-write second

sha-divergence on the same entity id with **both sides edited since the common ancestor** (ancestor sha tracked in the registry per entity family) is a *conflict*, not an LWW coin-flip:

1. Disjoint-field merges and insert-only unions resolve deterministically.
2. Genuinely divergent edits produce a **conflict record** in a review queue. A background LLM pass (`one_shot_completion(use_case="background")` — the reasoning axis, never the chat/native-runtime axis) drafts a proposed merged version with a rationale, **surfaced as a needs-review item; never auto-applied** (soul rule: propose, don't write). Until resolved, the local version stays authoritative locally and both versions persist in the shared store (no data loss while the user decides).
3. Conflicts on **memory-domain** entries route to the memory review surface; **knowledge-domain** conflicts to the knowledge UI — the boundary holds even in failure paths.

### 4.3 Transports — first-party provider apps

Each transport is an app-delivered provider of a NEW extension type `sync` (see Plug-in Map for the exact wiring). Contract:

```python
class SyncTransportProvider(ABC):
    name: str; display_name: str
    def push(objects: list[SyncObject]) -> PushResult      # insert-only; idempotent on object key
    def list_remote(prefix: str) -> list[RemoteRef]        # key + size + fingerprint (mtime/etag/sha)
    def pull(refs: list[RemoteRef]) -> list[SyncObject]
    def cas_registry(expected_sha: str | None, data: bytes) -> bool
    def test() -> ConnectionResult                          # the ModelCatalog.test_connection precedent
```

First targets, each a first-party app under `apps/` (installed copies at `~/.gideon/apps/{name}/`, settings via `ProviderSettings` → `data/config.json`, credentials via the credential store / `save_credential` `.env` 0600 path):

| App | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git-sync` | subprocess `git` against a user repo | The trust-feature default: human-diffable history of what the assistant knows. Commit = push; `git log -p` over shards is the audit UI for free |
| `dir-sync` | copy into any local/auto-synced folder (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Syncthing) | Zero credentials; the folder's own sync does transport; registry CAS degrades to rename-based locking |
| `rsync-sync` | `rsync` over ssh | subprocess; host/path from provider settings |
| `s3-sync` | S3-compatible HTTP (signed PUT/GET/LIST) | Routes through `net.fetch` with a derived `SYNC` `EgressPolicy` (host-pinned to the configured endpoint, raised `max_bytes`, via `egress_policy_for()`) — never hand-rolled aiohttp |

### 4.4 Encryption for untrusted stores

Optional end-to-end encryption (lifeGLANCE's codec, adapted): AES-256-GCM per shard, per-shard key via HKDF from a user passphrase + a first-write-wins salt object in the sync root; **routing/metadata fields (manifest entry names, machine_id, seq) stay plaintext** so sync logic works without the key; key derivation is machine-agnostic so every machine with the passphrase can decrypt every other's shards. Default **ON** for `s3-sync` and `dir-sync` (third-party storage), default **OFF** for `git-sync` to a private repo — encryption destroys diffability, and the human-readable git history is the point; the toggle states that tradeoff explicitly. Plaintext-over-encrypted-store is rejected on both send AND receive as a permanent skip (contract violation, never an error loop). Never fabricate a salt; missing salt with encryption enabled is a hard setup error.

**Secrets never sync, ever** — `secret=True` inventory entries are excluded before any transport sees bytes, independent of encryption.

---

## 5. Workspace Time-Travel (NEW-4.a) — adaptive-debounce git + rollback/revert/preview

Continuous, zero-thought history for the state the user and the agent edit most, distinct from scheduled snapshots (which are for disasters; this is for "undo what just happened"):

- **Roots:** `config.json` (+ entity_settings), `skills/`, the memory markdown workspace (`workspace/memory`, `workspace/_ext/`, `plan_memory/`), `prompts/` + `prompt_snippets/`, and `projects/<id>/context/`. Each root is (or shares) a local git repo under the `state-history` umbrella (§3).
- **Adaptive debounce:** after any write (hooked at the `atomic_write` seam via a lightweight post-write notifier — one callsite, since every JSON store already funnels through it; tree writes hook the same notifier at their save paths), a commit is scheduled starting at 10s and tightening toward 0 under sustained write activity; work serialized per repo root through one queue (space-agent's proven design). Near-zero cost, full history.
- **Rollback vs revert as distinct operations:** *rollback* = hard reset to a commit, with prior HEAD preserved in service-owned refs so later commits stay listable (forward travel possible); *revert* = inverse commit via reverse-merge so non-overlapping later edits survive — overlap fails loudly naming the blocking file. Secrets (`.env` etc.) are gitignored in every root yet preserved across rollbacks.
- **Preview before destruction:** every rollback/revert first returns an operation preview (affected files + per-file diffs; diffs >1MB listed not rendered) that the UI confirms.
- **UI panel:** Settings → Durability → Time Travel: per-root commit timeline, diff preview, rollback/revert buttons, and a "what changed while I slept" filter (commits authored by background sessions vs interactive ones — commit messages carry the writing surface). Config/skills restores that require a process reload surface the existing restart affordance.

Time-travel is *local-only* history; it never syncs (the shard/sync layer is the cross-machine story — one writer per mechanism).

---

## 6. User-Facing Portability Endpoints (NEW-4.b)

`portability.py` grows from a zip pair into a DSAR-shaped surface — the safety net that works even if the user never configures sync:

- `POST /api/durability/export` — full or per-domain (memory / knowledge / work / automation / platform / config) shard export as a zip (inventory-driven; `secret ∪ derived` excluded exactly as `EXPORT_EXCLUDE` does today), with the §2 manifest inside. "Give me everything Gideon knows about me" is one click.
- `POST /api/durability/import {mode: merge|replace}` — extends `validate_import_zip`/`apply_import_zip` to the full inventory (traversal-safe, MANIFEST version 3 with 1|2 back-compat; replace strips sensitive + `skills/auto` first, as today).
- `GET /api/durability/archive` + `POST /api/durability/archive/{id}/restore` — the snapshot list/restore pair (§3) exposed as the archive browser: date, size, per-domain row counts (from the manifest), validate status from the last drill.
- Knowledge exports include the `files/` originals (they are the user's documents/photos — the whole point); memory exports are the harness-internals dump, labeled as such in the UI. The two are separate export buttons, not one blob.

---

## 7. What We Deliberately Do NOT Build

- **No Gideon sync server / no server-to-server protocol** (amendment NEW-4.c is explicit) — dumb user-owned storage + insert-only objects + a registry file. The lifeGLANCE endpoint design survives only as *semantics* (insert-only, batch, list-since, first-write-wins salt), mapped onto object storage.
- **No CRDTs.** Per-id union + LWW + tombstones + a review queue for real conflicts. Single-user-few-machines does not need convergence theory; it needs "never lose a row and never silently pick a loser."
- **No auto-applied LLM merges** — proposals only (soul).
- **No continuous real-time sync.** Staleness-window pull + after-write push. This is a personal tool; seconds-level convergence is enterprise machinery.
- **No secret syncing, no credential export** — credentials re-enter per machine via the existing onboarding/`save_credential` path.
- **No second scheduler** — snapshot timing rides the existing schedule service now, system triggers later (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE owns that migration).
- **No new notification path** — drills/failures route through `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()`.

---

## 8. Disposition Table

| Surface | Verdict | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot.py` | **ABSORBED** (kept as the tar engine) | `VALID_COMPONENTS`/`CORE_FILES` re-derived from the inventory (§1); gains `everything`; sqlite-backup-API applied to ALL `*.db` discovered (fixes the live `knowledge.db` raw-copy hazard); WAL checkpoint, `_data_filter`, atomic tar rename, 0600, `--keep` (→ rolling tiers), merge helpers all kept verbatim. CLI stays; the service (§3) becomes its caller |
| `portability.py` | **ABSORBED** | `EXPORT_EXCLUDE`/`EXCLUDE_DIRS` re-derived from `secret ∪ derived`; zip format gains the shard manifest (v3); endpoints grow into §6's surface; existing merge/replace + traversal validation kept |
| `_merge_memory` / `_merge_crons` / `_merge_notifications` | **KEPT + generalized** | Become the `sqlite_attach_ignore` / `union_by_id` / `append_dedup` merge strategies of the inventory; the sync import path (§4.1) and dashboard import reuse the same functions |
| `atomic_write` / `single_flight` | **KEPT — load-bearing** | Shard writer + service overlap guard; time-travel's post-write notifier hooks the `atomic_write` seam |
| `sessions/*.jsonl`, `notifications.jsonl` | **COVERED as append streams** | Year-sharded JSONL shards, `append_dedup` merge; incognito/temporary sessions: the `memory_mode` metadata head-line rides along so a restored store re-derives suppression exactly as history consolidation does |
| `workspace/outbox` | **UNTOUCHED** | Pre-existing dir, unrelated concern; the sync outbox lives at `~/.gideon/sync/outbox/` |
| AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE `triggers.json` | **FORWARD-COMPATIBLE** | Inventory line item swaps from crons/hooks/event_triggers/autonudge to `triggers.json` + ledger when that plan's step 9 lands (it already owns snapshot-coverage updates) |

## Provider & Config Plug-in Map

Where each new piece plugs into the pluggable-provider architecture (recon: providers.md) — nothing invents a parallel extension path:

- **New provider type `sync`:** added to `PROVIDER_TYPES` (apps/manifest.py) **AND** a `SyncTypeHandler` in `providers/registry.py:get_provider_registry()` **in the same commit** — `test_manifest_types_match_handlers` guards the #47 bug class (never add one side only). The handler `create()`s via the standard `providers/loader.py:load_factory` (manifest `provider: {type: "sync", implementation: "provider:create_provider"}`) with `ProviderSettings` config, and registers into a new domain registry `sync_transports/registry.py` (flat dict + register/get, the `action_providers/registry.py` shape). Transports are ordinary apps: install → enable → factory → registry; disable unregisters.
- **SDK:** `sdk/sync.py` re-exports `SyncTransportProvider` + `SyncObject`/`PushResult` so third-party transports (a future WebDAV or Google Drive transport) are buildable against `SDK_VERSION 1.0` conventions; `sdk.net` + `sdk.credentials` cover their egress and secrets exactly as model apps do today.
- **No new action provider is required** (so no `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` change in the core slices). IF a later slice adds a hook-invokable `run-backup` action (e.g. "snapshot before every risky workflow"), it follows the rule to the letter: implement `ActionProvider`, register via `register_action_provider` or as an app, **and add its name to `ALLOWED_HOOK_PROVIDERS` (validation.py:555)** or hook create/update rejects it.
- **Config = a new `DurabilityConfig` section**, wired through the FOUR points (recon persistence-security gotcha #1): (a) dataclass fields with `_meta(label, help)` (schema reachability tests enforce, per-element `_meta` if any `list[dataclass]` field appears); (b) `AppConfig.load()` explicit field-by-field mapping (omission = silently dropped); (c) `to_dict()` — a NEW top-level section must be added; (d) `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH allowlist + FE for the runtime-editable knobs. Fields: `snapshot_enabled`, `snapshot_interval_hours`, `keep_daily/weekly/monthly`, `drill_enabled`, `timetravel_enabled`, `timetravel_debounce_secs`, `sync_enabled`, `sync_transport` (provider name), `sync_stale_after_secs`, `sync_encrypt`.
- **Egress:** only `s3-sync` talks to non-user-controlled infrastructure over HTTP → derived `SYNC` `EgressPolicy` profile through `egress_policy_for()` + `net.fetch` (operator `security.egress` layering applies for free). `git`/`rsync` shell out to user-configured hosts via subprocess — `denied_command_patterns()` and the security policy layer are unaffected and unbypassed (no new command surfaces added to agents; the service, not the agent, invokes them).
- **Secrets:** transport credentials via the credential store (`save_credential` → `.env` 0600, names-not-values in any API response); the sync passphrase-derived key cached non-extractably in the service, never persisted; every journal/SEL record stores key *names* only.
- **Audit + notify:** SEL events for export/push/pull/merge/conflict/restore/drill; user-facing outcomes through `DashboardState.notify` → `notification_allowed()` — the entity-settings gate stays THE gate.
- **Memory vs knowledge routing:** the inventory `domain` field is the boundary's mechanical enforcement — memory-domain shards/conflicts/exports route to memory surfaces and are LEARNING-FLYWHEEL's concern to evolve; knowledge-domain ones to the knowledge UI; future knowledge providers (Google Drive, Google Photos) plug into the existing `knowledge_providers` seam and their *items* enter durability through `knowledge.db` like everything else — this plan never writes to either subsystem's contents, only copies them.

---

## Implementation Order & Effort

**5 sessions** (the NEW-4 core is ~4; amendments a-c add ~1). Each slice ships independently and is useful alone:

- **Session 1 — Inventory + gap closure + safe snapshots.** `durability/inventory.py` + the claims-everything test; re-derive snapshot/portability allowlists; sqlite-backup-API for all DBs (knowledge.db hazard fixed); `everything` component; rolling retention tiers. *Backup is now complete and correct, still manual.*
- **Session 2 — Shard exporter + manifest + validate + snapshot service.** §2 format (canonical JSONL, year shards, part-split, tombstone write-path hook, blob dir for knowledge files); `backup validate`; boot-started service with nightly tar + hourly dirty-entry shard export + hourly git commit of memory tree/shards; restore endpoints (merge live / replace staged-for-boot); monthly restore drill + notify. *Scheduled, drilled durability.*
- **Session 3 — Sync core + `git-sync` + `dir-sync`.** `sync` type (manifest + handler together), domain registry, `sdk/sync.py`; pull→merge-import→export-union→push with the registry/CAS, staleness window, outbox + cursor rules; deterministic merges + tombstones; conflict records + propose-only LLM merge queue; the two zero-credential transports. *Two machines converge over a git repo or a synced folder.*
- **Session 4 — `rsync-sync` + `s3-sync` + encryption.** `SYNC` egress profile; HKDF/AES-GCM codec with first-write-wins salt + plaintext routing fields + both-direction plaintext rejection; per-transport encryption defaults. *Untrusted storage becomes a valid transport.*
- **Session 5 — Time-travel + portability endpoints + FE.** §5 adaptive-debounce repos + rollback/revert/preview; §6 export/import/archive endpoints; Settings → Durability panel (status card, archive browser, sync config via the standard `/api/providers/...` routes, time-travel timeline, conflict review queue). *The whole story has a face.*

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Live sqlite copied mid-write (today's knowledge.db reality) | sqlite backup API for every DB, discovered by extension; WAL checkpoint first; drill's `integrity_check` catches regressions |
| A new store dodges backup (the CORE_FILES drift class) | Inventory claims-everything test fails CI the moment an unclaimed path appears under `config_dir()` |
| Sync resurrects deleted entities | Tombstone rows for `tombstones=True` kinds; union merge honors `deleted_at` |
| Silent conflict data loss | sha-divergence vs common ancestor → conflict record; both versions retained; LLM merge is propose-only |
| Secrets leak into a remote store | `secret=True` excluded before any transport; names-not-values in APIs; encryption default-on for third-party storage; SEL audit on every push |
| Registry CAS races between machines | Insert-only object writes are idempotent; CAS failure → re-pull, re-merge, retry — never overwrite |
| Backup that can't restore | Monthly automated drill (validate + integrity_check + count diff) with loud notify on failure |
| Time-travel commit storms under heavy writes | Adaptive debounce (10s→0), serialized per root; derived/cache paths gitignored |
| Restore under a running gateway corrupts open stores | Replace-restore stays staged-for-boot (existing `_is_gateway_running` refusal honored); merge path uses the store-aware merge helpers |
| Shard export blocking the event loop / GIL pressure | Export + git + encryption run in a worker subprocess/thread pool; `single_flight` prevents overlap |

---

## Success Criteria

1. `gideon backup snapshot --components everything` followed by wiping `~/.gideon` and restoring reproduces a byte-equivalent state for every non-derived inventory entry — **including tasks, projects, entity_settings, loop, prompts, workflows, agents, and app data**, which today's tools drop.
2. The inventory claims-everything test fails when a new store directory is added without an inventory entry.
3. `backup validate` on a fresh shard export passes; corrupting one byte of any shard makes it fail naming the shard; the drill notification arrives on schedule with real numbers.
4. Two machines syncing through a plain git repo converge: a task created on A and a knowledge item added on B both exist on both after one sync cycle each way; a task deleted on A stays deleted on B (tombstone), and indexes (FTS/faiss) rebuild locally rather than syncing.
5. Editing the same task's description on both machines while offline produces a conflict-review item with an LLM-proposed merge — and applies **nothing** until the user accepts.
6. `git log -p` on the state-history repo shows an hour-granular, human-readable diff of memory changes; restoring the memory tree to any commit works via the panel with a preview first (the 2026-07-02 incident is now a 1-hour rollback).
7. No shard, sync object, or export zip ever contains `.env`, `.local_secret`, `sel_hmac.key`, or `telemetry_salt` (adversarially verified against every transport).
8. An encrypted S3 sync store is useless without the passphrase, yet `list_remote`/registry operations work without the key; a plaintext object appearing in an encrypted store is skipped permanently and logged, never looped on.
9. Memory-domain and knowledge-domain state are separately exportable, separately drill-counted, and their conflicts land on separate review surfaces — the boundary survives every path in this plan.
10. Installing a third-party sync transport app (manifest `type: "sync"`) registers, configures via the standard provider settings routes, and syncs — with zero core changes.

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — sibling-platform gap analysis, owner greenlight)

**Merge-mode restore as a first-class, plan-printing citizen.** Sibling evidence: the restore people actually perform is "onto a machine that already has state" (new laptop half-set-up, partial loss, second machine) — and replace-mode restores there destroy the newer half. Recon: `snapshot.py::restore_main` (:604) ALREADY has `--mode merge|replace`, `--dry-run`, and auto-defaults to merge when `memory.db` exists (:650) — with real merge helpers (`_merge_memory` ATTACH + INSERT OR IGNORE over the 4-table allowlist; `_merge_crons` by job name; `_merge_notifications` by ts; `_copy_tree_no_overwrite` for trees) and `portability.py` reusing them. Credentials are already never in exports (`EXPORT_EXCLUDE`: `.env`, `.local_secret`, `sel_hmac.key`, `telemetry_salt` — verified) and snapshot-tar restore of security files is copy-if-missing only. So the amendment does NOT build merge restore — it closes the three honest gaps: (1) merge coverage is only as wide as `CORE_FILES` (tasks/projects/inbox/entity_settings etc. have NO merge semantics — the §1 inventory's `merge` field is specified but merge-restore isn't listed as a consumer), (2) `--dry-run` prints a raw file list, not a merge plan (no counts, no per-entry strategy, no conflict preview), (3) config merge is copy-if-missing per file — an existing `config.json` is safe, but this contract must be stated and tested, not incidental.

### Contract-level design

- **Inventory-driven merge (extends §1/§3, no new mechanism):** `restore --mode merge` iterates `durability/inventory.py` entries and dispatches on the already-specified `merge` field — `union_by_id` (entity dirs: copy rows/files whose id is absent), `sqlite_attach_ignore` (memory/knowledge DBs — content-hash-keyed INSERT OR IGNORE where the schema has stable ids; `episodic_memories.id` is the PK, verified `vector_memory.py:269`), `append_dedup` (JSONL by stable ts/event id — inbox items dedup by their `{channel}_{ts}` id), `replace_only` entries are **SKIPPED in merge mode with an explicit printed line** (never half-merged). **`config.json` is NEVER overwritten in merge mode** — stated in code and tested: existing file untouched (today's copy-if-missing behavior becomes the documented contract); missing file restored.
- **`--dry-run` prints the merge plan** (and becomes the default prompt before a live merge): per inventory entry `{entry, strategy, incoming_rows, would_add, would_skip_existing, skipped_replace_only}` computed by running every merge helper in plan-mode (a `dry_run: bool` threaded through `_merge_*`; sqlite plan via the same SELECTs without the INSERT). Exit 0; nothing written.
- **Auto-detect default (sharpens :650):** restoring onto a non-empty home (any non-derived inventory entry present — not just `memory.db`) → propose merge, print the plan, require confirmation; `--replace` stays the explicit wipe path and keeps the `_is_gateway_running` refusal + `pre-restore-<ts>` escape hatch verbatim. `POST /api/durability/restore` (§3) mirrors: `{mode}` omitted → server picks merge on non-empty and returns the plan for the UI to confirm (§2.2 envelope on errors).
- Credentials-never-in-snapshots: already true — merge mode additionally never writes any `secret=True` entry even if a hand-built archive contains one (belt-and-suspenders skip + warning).

### Session placement

Folded into **Session 2** (which already owns the restore endpoints + `backup validate`); the merge-plan UI confirm lands with Session 5's archive browser. Session count stays 5.

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2-M1 | Inventory-driven merge dispatch: `restore --mode merge` walks `StateEntry.merge` strategies; replace_only entries skipped loudly; config-never-overwritten contract in code + test | `snapshot.py`, `durability/inventory.py`, tests | fixture home with tasks+inbox+memory merges a snapshot: absent rows appear, existing rows untouched, `config.json` byte-identical, replace_only lines printed |
| T2-M2 | Merge-plan dry-run: `dry_run` threaded through every `_merge_*`; plan table printed; `--dry-run` and the pre-merge confirmation share one code path | `snapshot.py` merge helpers | plan counts match the subsequent real merge exactly on the same fixture; nothing written in plan mode (dir hash unchanged) |
| T2-M3 | Auto-detect + API mirror: non-empty-home detection over the inventory; CLI proposes merge+plan+confirm; `--replace` explicit; `POST /api/durability/restore` returns the plan when mode omitted | `snapshot.py`, `durability/` restore endpoint | empty home → replace path; non-empty → merge proposed with plan; explicit `--replace` still refuses while gateway runs; secret-entry planted in archive is skipped + warned |

## Execution log

- [2026-07-28][S1] DONE: inventory + gap closure + safe snapshots. (a) **`durability/inventory.py`** — the single manifest of what Gideon's state IS: 56 `StateEntry` rows (id/kind/path/domain/merge + `secret`/`derived`/`tombstones`/`derived_within`), grounded by enumerating BOTH a fresh dev home and a long-lived real home rather than trusting the plan's or the code's claims. Projections replace the hand-maintained lists: `backup_entries()`, `export_entries()`, `secret_paths()`, `sqlite_entries()`, `domains()`/`entries_for_domain()`. `merge`/`tombstones` are declared now but consumed by S2/S3 — they're part of an entry's identity, not a later bolt-on. (b) **`audit_home()` — the claims-everything guard**: every top-level path must be claimed by an entry or matched by `IGNORED`, AND (my addition beyond the plan) **every `*.db` found anywhere must be declared `kind=sqlite`** — a database nested inside a `tree` entry is the dangerous case, since it gets filesystem-copied. Both real homes audit clean (claimed 23/25, 0 unclaimed, 0 undeclared DBs). (c) **THE DATA-LOSS FIX, measured not argued**: only `CORE_FILES["memory"]` got the sqlite backup API; `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`, `workspace/lexicon/lexicon.db` and `loop/loops.db` were inside `shutil.copytree`/`copy2` paths. I reproduced the hazard: a live WAL DB with an open handle and 576KB of un-checkpointed WAL, raw-copied, **lost 2000 of 4000 rows**. Now `_declared_db_paths()` drives (i) a WAL checkpoint per declared DB, (ii) a `_safe_copy_db()` backup-API pass that runs BEFORE the tree copies, and (iii) `_tree_ignore_dbs()` so tree copies skip `*.db`/`-wal`/`-shm` entirely — verified: all 4 DBs staged, `integrity_check=ok`, **2000/2000 rows captured from the live open DB**, zero sidecars in the archive. (d) **Gap closure**: `_everything_paths()` stages every remaining inventory entry, so `tasks/`, `projects/`, `loop/`, `artifacts/`, `prompts/`, `workflows/`, `agents/`, `apps/`, `entity_settings/`, `sessions/`, `uploads/` are now in the archive — verified end-to-end on a seeded home (the seeded task survived a real snapshot round-trip). Before this, a "full backup" silently dropped the user's entire task board. (e) `portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE` is now a PROJECTION of `secret=True` (it gained `credentials`, which it was missing) with a literal fallback so an import error can never widen an export. 25 new tests (`test_durability_inventory.py` 15 + `test_snapshot.py` +10, incl. a parametrized live-open-DB capture test per DB and the sidecar-exclusion test).
- [2026-07-28][S1] DISCOVERY + FIX (pre-existing bug, in scope because it corrupts backup semantics): `_default_snapshot_dir()`'s fallback hardcoded `Path.home()/".gideon"/"snapshots"` instead of the ACTIVE home, so snapshotting an isolated dev home wrote its archive into the REAL home — mixing two installs' backups in the directory retention pruning then walks. I hit this live (an archive appeared in `~/.gideon/snapshots`; removed it — it was the only file there and seconds old). Now resolves `_pc_dir()`, pinned by `test_default_output_dir_honors_the_active_home`.
- [2026-07-28][S1] Gate: `make lint` green (517 files) · `make test` **8286 passed** · new tests stable over 3 repeat runs. NOTE on a scary-looking intermediate: one full-suite run showed 275s + 2 `test_subagent.py::TestOnDoneTimeout` timeouts, the exact signature of the CONTEXT-ECONOMY-S5 perf regression. It was NOT a regression — it was machine contention from my own concurrently-running baseline suite. Confirmed by re-running (51s, then 58s, both green) and by timing the new tests in isolation (4.6s total). The lesson from S5 still holds (compare duration against a baseline), but the corollary is: never run two full suites at once and then read the timing.
- [2026-07-28][S1] Remaining: S2 (shard exporter + manifest + `backup validate` + boot-started snapshot service + restore drills) and S3 (sync core + `git-sync`/`dir-sync`). §3's rolling retention tiers were NOT built this session — the existing `--keep N` remains; the tiered N-nightly/M-weekly/Y-monthly generalization belongs with S2's scheduled service, which is what makes tiers meaningful (a manual CLI has no cadence to tier).
- [2026-07-28][S2a] DONE (§2 — the shard format half of Session 2): `durability/shards.py`. (a) **Deterministic export** — `export_shards()` writes canonical JSONL (sorted keys, compact separators, LF, UTF-8) one directory per inventory entry, rows sorted by id; entity dirs → `entities.jsonl`, single JSON docs → `value.jsonl`, append-only stores → YEAR shards with unparseable-timestamp rows in `unknown.jsonl` (never back-dated), databases → one JSONL per table, tree entries → a content-addressed `blobs/` dir deduped by sha256. Files past `PART_SPLIT_BYTES` (48MiB) split into `part-NNNN` at boundaries that are a pure function of the content. (b) **Manifest + `validate()`** — `manifest.json` pins `schema_version`, `generated_at`, a NEW non-secret `machine_id` file (deliberately not `telemetry_salt`, which is `secret=True`), and per-shard `{bytes, rows, sha256}`; `validate()` re-derives all three, re-parses every row, and flags shards present-but-undeclared. (c) **CLI** `gideon backup export [--incremental]` / `backup validate`, non-zero exit on any problem so it works from cron/CI; export runs under `single_flight("shard-export")`; `dirty_entries()` gives the mtime-fingerprint incremental path. (d) **KEY DESIGN CALL — table discovery, not an allowlist:** `_sqlite_tables()` reads the schema. DISCOVERY CONFIRMED: `snapshot._merge_memory`'s 4-table allowlist names `knowledge_facts` + `knowledge_edges`, which **do not exist in memory.db** (verified against the real home: tables are `schema_version, semantic_memory, episodic_memories, memory_events, sqlite_sequence`) — two of four merge targets are dead code, which the exporter deliberately does NOT inherit. (e) Databases are read through the sqlite backup API into a scratch copy, so a live WAL store exports consistently (the S1 hazard, same fix); blob columns are recorded as `{"__bytes__": n}` rather than base64-bloating a human-diffable shard; secrets are excluded unconditionally (`export_entries()`).
  **BUG FOUND AND FIXED DURING VALIDATION:** an `--incremental` export rewrote `manifest.json` with only the changed entries' shards, orphaning the rest — so a perfectly good export failed `validate` with "present on disk but not declared". `_merged_shard_records()` now carries forward untouched entries' records (dropping any whose file has since vanished). Regression-tested.
  **MEASURED on the real home:** 22 entries / 24 shards / **50,205 rows** exported and validated clean. **Determinism proven twice** — two independent exports of live state produced byte-identical shards (every sha256 equal), and a re-export of an unchanged dev home left **zero** changed shard files. **Reviewability proven:** adding one task yields exactly ONE added line in the shard diff (`+{"data":{...},"id":"t-readable"}`). Corruption detection proven for all four modes (tampered content → sha mismatch, deleted shard, undeclared stray file, unparseable row). 28 tests in `test_durability_shards.py`. Gate: `make lint` green (518 files), `make test` **8314 passed** (51.5s — no regression). Docs: `docs/reference/cli.md` gained both subcommands.
  **DEFERRED to S2b (deliberate scope split, not an omission):** the §3 boot-started snapshot SERVICE (nightly tar + hourly incremental + hourly git commit), rolling retention tiers, the `POST /api/durability/restore` + `GET /api/durability/snapshots` endpoints, the monthly restore drill, and the T2-M1/M2/M3 inventory-driven merge amendment (merge dispatch on `StateEntry.merge`, `dry_run` merge plan, non-empty-home auto-detect). Each is independently valuable and independently completable; shipping the format + verification first means the service has something verified to schedule.

## Execution log — Session 2b (scheduled snapshot service)

### 2026-07-28 — §3 service + tiered retention + drills: DONE. Restore endpoint + T2-M1..M3 NOT in this session (see below).

New `durability/retention.py` (pure tier math) and `durability/service.py` (the
boot-started loop), plus `dashboard/handlers/durability.py` and three routes.
Durability stops depending on remembering to run a command.

**What landed**

- **Tiered retention** replacing `--keep N`. `keep N` on a nightly schedule means a
  week of history and nothing older, which is the wrong shape: corruption you notice
  immediately needs yesterday, corruption you notice in April needs January. N daily
  + M weekly + Y monthly, one promoted snapshot per period, tiers as UNIONS not
  slices. Measured: 400 nightly snapshots thin to **30 files spanning 12 months**.
  Idempotent, and it only ever deletes files whose names it positively recognizes.
- **The loop**: hourly incremental shard export (bounds a loss to one hour), nightly
  full snapshot + retention, monthly restore drill. Elapsed-time scheduling rather
  than wall-clock, so a laptop asleep at 03:00 gets its snapshot on the next wake
  instead of silently skipping the night. Every job is `single_flight`-guarded across
  processes, runs on an executor thread, and swallows its own failure into an audited
  report — a backup service that can kill a gateway is worse than none.
- **Restore drills**: extract the newest snapshot to a temp dir, `PRAGMA
  integrity_check` every SQLite copy, and report PASS/FAIL through
  `DashboardState.notify` — a FAILURE is `warning`, not `info`, so minimum-severity
  and quiet-hours filters can't hide it. Never touches live state. A failed drill is
  still time-stamped so it warns once instead of every tick.
- **Config** `durability.{auto_backup,keep_daily,keep_weekly,keep_monthly,restore_drills}`
  wired dataclass + `_meta` → `load()` (via `_guard_flag`, so ambiguity keeps backups
  RUNNING) → `to_dict()`. Fail-safe direction throughout: losing scheduled backups to
  an unreadable config value is the exact failure this plan exists to prevent.
- **Endpoints**: `GET /api/durability/status`, `GET /api/durability/snapshots` (the
  archive list WITH the retention plan, so the policy is inspectable before it
  deletes anything), `POST /api/durability/run {job}` for "back up before I do
  something risky".

**Two real bugs found by running it, not by reading it**

1. **Retention matched nothing.** The filename regex assumed
   `gideon-snapshot-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`; `snapshot.py` actually writes
   `%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ`. Consequence was silent and total — every file was unrecognized,
   so retention kept all of them while reporting success. Now verified against the
   real output and test-locked.
2. **The incremental export never noticed a memory write.** Every store runs in WAL
   mode, so a committed write lands in the `-wal` sidecar and `memory.db`'s own mtime
   does not move — `_fingerprint` reported "unchanged" through an entire session of
   writes, meaning the hourly job backed up nothing. `_fingerprint` now folds in the
   `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars. **This bug predates this session** (S2a shipped
   `_fingerprint`), and it defeated the single most valuable property of the whole
   plan, so it is worth remembering as a class: fingerprinting a SQLite file means
   fingerprinting its sidecars.

Also corrected: the job reported `len(result.shards)` — the MERGED manifest, which
carries untouched shards forward — making an idle hour look like a full backup. It
now reports entries actually re-exported. And `export_shards(entries=[])` reads the
empty list as falsy and exports EVERYTHING, so the nothing-changed case must return
before that call.

**NOT in this session, deliberately:**

- **`POST /api/durability/restore`.** Replace-restore refuses to run while the
  gateway is up (`_is_gateway_running`), so a useful endpoint needs the
  staged-swap-on-next-boot machinery §3 describes (staged dir + marker file the
  startup path applies before opening stores). Half of that is worse than none — an
  endpoint that appears to restore and doesn't is a trap — so restore stays
  `gideon restore` until the staging lands. The handler docstring says so.
- **T2-M1/M2/M3** (inventory-driven merge dispatch, merge-plan dry-run, non-empty-home
  auto-detect). These are `snapshot.py` merge-path work, independent of the schedule,
  and folding them in would have made one unreviewable change. Next Durability
  session.
- The hourly **git commit** of the memory markdown tree (§3's `state-history/` repo).
  Independent of the schedule loop; belongs with the §5 time-travel work that owns the
  git surface.

Tests: `tests/test_durability_service.py`, 49 cases. Validated as a user on an
isolated dev home: the service ran unattended at boot (snapshot + shards + drill
verifying 4 databases), the snapshots endpoint showed the tier plan without deleting
anything, on-demand jobs and both input validations behaved, the drill notification
was delivered, and the gateway log was clean. Full suite 8679 passed; lint clean.

## Execution log — Session 2c (the backups settings surface)

- [2026-07-29][S2c] **DONE.** Closed the frontend leg of §3. S2a/S2b shipped the shard
  format, the scheduled service, tiered retention, restore drills and three endpoints —
  with **no frontend at all**, which left a data-protection surface entirely invisible.

  **The gap was wider than "no control for 5 fields."** `durability.*` had its dataclass,
  `_meta`, `load()` and `to_dict()` legs wired but **no PATCH allowlist entry**, so the
  five shipped fields were file-editable only. And `grep -rn "api/durability" web/src`
  returned **zero** — the `status`, `snapshots` and `run` endpoints had no reader either,
  so a user could not see what the schedule had produced, let alone change it. Both halves
  are now closed: the five dot-paths joined `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` and a new Settings →
  **Backups** panel consumes all three endpoints.

  **`snapshot_dir` is deliberately NOT patchable.** Repointing where backups are written
  is a filesystem decision (permissions, mount points, free space) and a bad value silently
  redirects every future backup. It stays a config-file edit; a test pins that the
  allowlist matches the dataclass *minus* that one field, so neither a new field nor a
  stray entry drifts unnoticed.

  **BUG FOUND BY DRIVING THE REAL ENDPOINT** (unit tests could not have caught it): I
  typed `JobResult.skipped` as `boolean` in `api.ts`, but it is a **reason string**
  (`service.py:55`, e.g. `"another export is already running"`, `"no snapshot to drill
  yet"`). Empty-string is falsy so the truthiness check happened to work, but the type was
  wrong and the panel was throwing away the server's own explanation in favour of a
  generic "skipped". Now typed `string` and the reason is surfaced verbatim. A skip is
  reported as success, not error — a healthy single-flight race is not a failure.

  **Restore is deliberately absent from the panel**, matching the handler module's own
  stated reasoning: replace-restore refuses to run while the gateway is up, so a useful
  restore endpoint needs staged-swap-on-next-boot machinery that does not exist, and a
  button that appears to restore and doesn't is a trap. The panel says restore is
  `gideon restore` rather than leaving a user hunting for it.

  Retention caps are bounded rather than open-ended (0 disables a tier; ceilings of
  365/260/120) so a typo cannot budget a decade of archives.

  **Validated as a user** on an isolated dev home (port 10732, never the owner's :10000),
  in a real browser: all five fields PATCHed and persisted to `config.json`; an
  out-of-range value was rejected (`must be between 0 and 365`); `snapshot_dir` was
  refused (`field not editable`); a real snapshot ran from the panel's button
  (`kept 1, pruned 1`) and appeared in the list with its size and the isolated-home path;
  the snapshot list reflected the tiers I had just PATCHed (3/0/1); **clicking the
  "Automatic backups" switch flipped `auto_backup` to `true` on disk** — the full
  five-point round trip proven through the UI, not just the API; the settings-home bento
  card surfaced under a search for "retention" showing live data ("1 snapshot kept",
  "Nightly + hourly, automatic"); zero console errors or warnings.

  Tests: 6 new cases in `test_durability_service.py::TestConfigContract` (54 in that
  file), including an allowlist-matches-dataclass assertion and a save+load round trip
  that pins **`False`** surviving — the interesting direction, since `_guard_flag` keeps
  backups ON for an unreadable value, so a deliberate opt-out must not be read back as
  True. Gate: `make lint` green · `make test` **8888 passed, 0 failed** · web typecheck +
  283 vitest + build green.

  **Pre-existing gap NOT closed here** (recorded, not fixed): `model_calls.jsonl` and
  `spend.json` are both unclaimed by `durability/inventory.py`, so neither is in a
  snapshot or an export. `audit_home()` does not catch them because it has **zero runtime
  callers** and its test builds a synthetic 5-path fixture home. That is a guardrails-store
  question, out of scope for a settings surface.

## Execution log — Session 2d (the declared merge with no executor)

- [2026-08-05][S176] **DONE.** Closed gap (1), which this plan names against itself:
  *"the §1 inventory's `merge` field is specified but merge-restore isn't listed as a
  consumer."* It was worse than an unlisted consumer — the field had **no executor at all**.

  **Swept the declared strategies against their readers.** All five `MERGE_*` constants in
  `durability/inventory.py` have zero readers outside their own declaration, and **14 of the
  38 entries declaring a merge strategy are never named by `snapshot._do_merge`**.
  `_do_merge` covers exactly seven components — `memory`, `crons`, `config`,
  `notifications`, `security`, `workspace`, `skills` — with **no glob or `iterdir`
  catch-all**, so an unlisted component is not degraded, it is absent.

  **Driven, not read.** A snapshot holding a `FROM-SNAPSHOT` run merged into a home holding
  `LIVE-run` came back holding only `LIVE-run`, while the CLI printed **"✅ Merge
  complete"**. That is a durability layer reporting success for a partial recovery — the one
  failure mode a backup system cannot have, since the user's evidence that it worked is the
  message it just printed.

  **Scoped to run history, deliberately.** Of the 14, this is the entry whose loss is
  **unrecoverable**: `config` and `models` can be re-entered by hand, `screenshots` are
  reproducible, but a run's history has no other source. The remaining 13 are recorded in
  the queue as follow-on work rather than swept in here, because each needs its own dedup
  key argued from its own format — a generic line-dedup would be the kind of
  one-size mechanism that later has to be unpicked per component.

  **Dedup key: `run_id`, not the whole line.** The same run round-trips through `to_dict()`
  on both sides, so a reordered key or a re-serialised float would make an identical run
  look new and double it. `_merge_notifications` dedupes on `ts` for the same reason.
  Per-shard, since the store is one file per job; a shard present only in the snapshot is
  copied whole, because an automation the live home has never run must still come back.

  🔴 **My own load-bearing check found that seven passing tests could not distinguish the
  fix from an inert one.** Disabling the call site in `_do_merge` left all 61 tests green —
  every one of them called `_merge_run_history` **directly**. A helper that works perfectly
  and is never invoked is this program's signature defect, and the suite I had just written
  would have shipped it. Added a test that drives `_do_merge` itself; with the wiring
  disabled it now fails, which is what makes the other seven trustworthy.

  **Does NOT rotate, on purpose.** `ScheduleRunStore.rotate_all()` owns retention and runs
  at gateway boot (S175). A second trim here would be another copy of that policy — exactly
  the duplication S175 deleted after finding it had silently reverted S173's per-class
  quota. Pinned by a source assertion, since the defect class is duplication rather than a
  wrong value.

  Also verified: idempotence (a re-run of the same merge imports 0 rows, so a repeated
  restore drill cannot double the history), a malformed line skipped without aborting the
  rest of the shard (a partial recovery beats an aborted one — the same call `count_since`
  makes), and an absent source directory as a clean no-op that creates no empty dir.

  Tests: 8 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (62 in that file). Gate: `make lint` green
  · full `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

## Execution log — Session 2e (the restore side of the gap closure)

- [2026-08-05][S177] **DONE.** Closed the restore half of criterion 1. S176 found one declared
  merge strategy with no executor; the obvious next question was whether the *component lists*
  agreed across capture and restore. They did not.

  **The asymmetry.** S1 widened CAPTURE to the whole inventory (`_everything_paths`), and its own
  comment records why: before it, "a full backup silently dropped the user's entire task board".
  **Both restore modes stayed hand-written seven-component lists.** Measured: eight stores captured
  into the archive — `tasks`, `projects`, `agents`, `prompts`, `workflows`, `artifacts`, `uploads`,
  `entity_settings` — and **zero of eight recovered** by either `--mode merge` or `--mode replace`,
  with both printing a success line. Widening only the capture side made the archive *look*
  complete; a snapshot is worth exactly what its restore returns.

  **Criterion 1's own invocation was rejected.** The criterion says
  `--components everything followed by wiping ~/.gideon and restoring reproduces a
  byte-equivalent state`. The CLI answered **"❌ Unknown component: everything"** — so there was no
  way to ask for the task board at all, and the criterion could not have been demonstrated as
  written.

  🔴 **My own fix shipped half-inert, and eight passing tests did not notice.** Only driving the
  criterion's actual drill — snapshot, wipe the home, restore — exposed it: `--components
  everything` restored the task board and **dropped `config.json`, `memory.db`,
  `notifications.jsonl`, `workspace/` and `skills/`**. Cause: I added `everything` as just another
  member of the list, so naming it made `_want` answer False for all seven *named* components. A
  flag whose entire promise is completeness, silently narrowing the restore — on the exact
  invocation the plan tells a user to type. `everything` is now a superset marker read inside
  `_want`, so one definition serves both modes. The drill returns **19/19 files, 0 lost**; the only
  byte deltas are capture-side `config.json` normalisation (pre-existing, verified by hashing the
  archive copy) and a fresh `security_events.jsonl`.

  **Secrets are deliberately NOT restored through the generic path.** `backup_entries()` includes
  them on purpose — "losing the credential store is exactly what a backup should prevent" — but
  re-planting `.env` / `credentials/` / `.local_secret` into a home that may have rotated or
  removed them is the opposite call. Capture writes a local 0600 archive; restore writes into a
  live home, so the two directions do not warrant one default. The named `security` component
  remains the deliberate route (copy-if-missing, `chmod 0600`).

  **Bounded by the inventory allowlist — which matters because `portability.py:305` calls
  `_do_replace` on the IMPORT path**, and an import archive can be another user's export. The
  projection iterates declared entries and asks whether each exists in the archive; it never walks
  the archive copying what it finds. Verified against a tree carrying `evil/payload.sh`,
  `.ssh/authorized_keys` and credential files: only `tasks` was selected.

  Also verified: merge leaves an existing file alone (local state wins — these entries have no
  field-level merge executor yet, so copy-if-missing is the honest half rather than a silent
  overwrite), replace moves the live copy into `pre-restore-<ts>/` before overwriting so the new
  coverage is as recoverable as the old, a targeted `--components memory` stays targeted, and
  derived indexes stay out via the same `backup_entries()` call so the reasoning cannot drift
  between the two directions.

  Tests: 12 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (74 in that file), including a structural
  assertion that the capture and restore projections cannot diverge except by the stated secret
  exclusion. Each of the four halves — merge wiring, replace wiring, the secret exclusion, the
  `everything` superset — verified load-bearing by unwiring it independently and confirming the
  intended test failed. Gate: `make lint` green · full `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

## Execution log — Session 2f (the audit log's merge, and a stale ratchet)

- [2026-08-05][S178] **DONE.** Closed the remaining `append_dedup` entries and re-measured the
  coverage ratchet that had been guarding them.

  **Reachable is not merged.** S177 made every store reachable, but reachably *copy-if-missing* — so
  a file the live home already had was left entirely alone. Measured: `security_events.jsonl` and
  `feedback.jsonl` recovered **zero** snapshot rows on a merge into a populated home.

  🔴 **The obvious fix was the dangerous one.** `security_events.jsonl` is the SEL — HMAC-signed,
  with the key living per-home in `sel_hmac.key`. A generic executor appending the snapshot's rows
  was driven across two homes with different keys: `verify_integrity` returned
  **checked=5, valid=2**, logging "SEL HMAC mismatch" for every imported row. A restore would have
  made the *tamper-evident* audit log report tampering — turning the one surface a user consults to
  ask "was I compromised?" into a false positive they cannot clear except by rotating the chain.

  So the merge is **key-gated and fail-CLOSED**, deliberately unlike the others here. `security`
  restores the key copy-if-missing, which makes the two cases decidable at restore time:

  * a **wiped** home takes the snapshot's key → its rows verify under it (measured 3/3 valid), and
    skipping unconditionally would discard recoverable audit history in the exact scenario a restore
    exists for;
  * a **live** home keeps its own key → the snapshot's rows could never verify, so importing them
    would only manufacture mismatches.

  A missing row beats an unverifiable one, because an audit trail's whole value is that a mismatch
  means something.

  `feedback.jsonl` carries no HMAC, so plain dedup on `FeedbackRecord.id` is safe. Neither executor
  re-applies retention — `feedback._CAP` and `ScheduleRunStore.rotate_all()` own theirs, and a second
  copy is the duplication S175 deleted after finding one had silently reverted S173. `crashes` and
  `sessions` are directories on disk, already union-merged per-file by S177's tree copy; a
  line-dedup executor would be the wrong shape for them.

  🔴 **A pre-existing ratchet caught the change, and was itself stale.**
  `test_the_snapshot_coverage_gap_list_can_only_shrink` correctly flagged `security_events` as closed
  (its own comment said the entry waited on "the dedup story S2 defines" — this is that story). But
  its detection *greps `snapshot.py` for each literal path*, which went blind the moment coverage
  became inventory-derived. Re-measured by driving real archive round-trips: **18 of its 24 "gaps"
  were already covered** — `tags.json`, `crashes`, `sessions`, `loop/loops.db`, `autonudge.json`,
  `mcp.json` and more — and 3 further entries are carried by an ancestor's tree copy.

  On those 3 I asserted in a draft comment that `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db` and
  `lexicon.db` were captured-but-not-restored, drove it, and was **wrong**: the `workspace` tree copy
  restores all three. They were listed only because neither projection *enumerates* them (nested
  under an already-staged top level), which the ratchet now accounts for.

  The list goes **24 → 4**, and every survivor is `derived=True` — pinned by a new test, so a
  genuinely uncovered non-derived store can no longer be parked there for a reason nobody re-checks.
  A ratchet that over-reports is not the safe direction: the list becomes noise and the one real gap
  hides among eighteen that are not.

  Tests: 6 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (86 in that file) driving the SEL through its REAL
  writer — a hand-built fixture could not answer whether imported rows verify — plus the rewritten
  ratchet and its new derived-only assertion in `tests/test_portability.py` (51). Every half verified
  load-bearing by unwiring it independently, including the ratchet in both directions (parking a
  non-derived store fails; breaking the store restore fails). Gate: `make lint` green · full
  `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

## Execution log — Session 2g (the guard that had never met a real home)

- [2026-08-05][S179] **DONE.** Closed §1's real gap: the manifest was incomplete, and the guard that
  exists to prevent exactly that had never been run against a real home.

  **How it surfaced.** Chasing the `lww_by_updated_at` entries for an executor, `tool_usage.json`
  turned out to have **zero writers** — usage moved into `learning.db` (`learning/usage.py`, "this
  moves it into `learning.db` beside the staging log"). The inventory still declared the retired JSON
  file and did **not** declare the database that replaced it.

  🔴 **`audit_home()` had no runtime caller.** It is the claims-everything guard — "keeps the manifest
  honest … which is precisely how nine directories silently escaped backup before the inventory
  existed" — and every invocation was in `test_durability_inventory.py`, against a hand-built
  eight-path fixture. So a store added *after* the manifest was written could not fail it. A guard
  that only ever runs against its own fixture is testing the fixture.

  Pointed at the real home for the first time: **10 unclaimed paths and 5482 undeclared databases**.
  Driven end to end, `learning.db` (135 KB — the Flywheel's staging log and usage counters),
  `inbox.json`, `spend.json` (which drives the budget caps), `model_calls.jsonl` and
  `session_search.db` were **all absent from a real archive**.

  **Ten entries declared, two of them `derived`.** Both index stores argue their own case:
  `session_search` "holds no truth of its own … better rebuilt than restored", `codegraph` re-parses
  on mtime — and a real home held **5478** codegraph databases. Declaring them as state would ship a
  cache in every snapshot; not declaring them at all was the bug.

  **Five machine-local paths IGNORED rather than declared.** `session_key` and `sessions.json` hold
  live auth material; `machine_id` is what `durability/shards.py` stamps shards with, so a restored
  copy would masquerade as the machine it came from. Ignored is not `secret=True` — a secret entry is
  captured *on purpose* so a backup can restore the credential store, whereas these must not travel
  at all.

  **`workflows/runs.db` was the hazard the DB check exists for.** A live database inside a
  `json_entity_dir` entry, so it was being filesystem-copied rather than staged through the safe
  backup API — "it gets filesystem-copied while open in WAL mode", the exact case S1 fixed for
  knowledge/lexicon/loops. Declaring it routes it to `_safe_copy_db` and excludes it from the tree
  copy.

  🔴 **My own first fix blinded that check, and driving it caught me.** Codegraph's 5478 rows drowned
  the report, so I exempted declared prefixes — keyed off `kind`/`derived`, which silenced a surprise
  DB in `loop/` and `workspace/` too. That is precisely the hazard the check exists for. Narrowed to
  an opt-in `db_container` flag, pinned by a test to codegraph alone; the **pre-existing**
  `test_an_undeclared_database_fails_the_audit` also refused the wide version, which is the second
  time this program's existing tests have judged a draft of mine correctly.

  **The guard now has a caller.** A `durability.inventory` Doctor probe at `CAPABILITY` tier —
  degraded, not failed, because unclaimed state is a backup-coverage gap the user should act on
  rather than a reason to call the install broken, and a lower tier would short-circuit the capability
  packs over an unrelated new file. Read-only (`audit_home` only stats and globs), evidence capped at
  20 rows per list with exact counts alongside, since an unreadable blob is the same failure as no
  evidence. Verified through `run_capability("durability")` and the frontend's generic capability
  card (renders "Durability"; no FE change needed).

  **S178's own ratchets then caught S179 twice**, which is what they were built for: the
  `append_dedup` sweep demanded an executor for the newly-declared `model_calls.jsonl` (added, keyed
  on `AttemptRecord.audit_id`), and the coverage ratchet demanded the two new derived indexes be
  listed with a reason. The third near-identical keyed-JSONL loop was extracted into
  `_merge_keyed_jsonl` — deliberately NOT used for `security_events.jsonl`, whose HMAC-key
  precondition must not be foldable into a generic helper a later caller reaches for the dedup alone.

  Both real homes now audit **ok=True, 0 unclaimed, 0 undeclared databases**.

  Tests: 8 new cases in `test_durability_inventory.py` (22), 4 in `test_resilience_doctor.py` (17),
  plus the two ratchet updates. Every half verified load-bearing by unwiring it independently. Gate:
  `make lint` green · full `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

## Execution log — Session 2h (the six sqlite stores with no ATTACH executor)

- [2026-08-05][S180] **DONE.** Finished the declared-strategy sweep: `sqlite_attach_ignore` had seven
  declaring entries and one executor.

  **The gap.** Only `memory.db` had a merge — a hand-written four-table allowlist. S177 made the other
  six reachable, but reachably *copy-if-missing*, so a database the live home already had kept its own
  rows and dropped the snapshot's entirely. Driven across all six — `learning.db`,
  `knowledge/knowledge.db`, `workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`, `loop/loops.db`,
  `workflows/runs.db`, `workspace/lexicon/lexicon.db` — a snapshot row and a live row went in and
  **only the live row came out**.

  **Generic, because the schemas said so.** I read the real tables in all six out of a long-lived real
  home and the dev home before writing anything: every one carries a primary key or unique index, so
  `INSERT OR IGNORE` deduplicates correctly and a repeated restore drill is a no-op. Six more
  hand-written allowlists would have been six more places for this defect class to recur, and the
  executor reads `sqlite_entries()` so a store declared later merges by default.

  🔴 **FTS5 shadow tables are the trap.** Merging them alongside the rest looks correct once and
  breaks on the second run: 40 documents indexed, then a repeated merge returned **80 rows for 40
  documents** — every search result duplicated — because `_data`/`_idx`/`_docsize` carry segment state
  `INSERT OR IGNORE` cannot reconcile. A restore drill is exactly the thing a user runs twice.

  🔴 **Unwiring each half corrected my own account of the fix.** I had credited the SKIP in the
  docstring; removing it left every test green, because the trailing `rebuild` repairs the shadow
  tables anyway — so the **rebuild** is the load-bearing half (without it: 0 hits for 40 documents).
  The skip still earns its place, and now has its own assertion: it stops the merge writing **160
  rows** of another database's segment state before overwriting them, and it means a future caller
  that rebuilds conditionally cannot silently reintroduce the doubling. Both halves are separately
  pinned.

  **`memory.db` stays on its own executor.** It filters `WHERE is_deleted=0`, and a probe confirmed a
  generic all-tables merge **resurrects a tombstoned row**. That filter is the reason the allowlist
  exists rather than an accident of it, so the call site excludes it explicitly. The six routed here
  were checked for soft-delete columns against both homes: none has one.

  **Containment differs from `_merge_memory` deliberately.** That function re-raises and `_do_merge`
  does not catch it, so a broken `memory.db` aborts the whole restore — correct for the primary store,
  since continuing past it would let a user believe their memory came back. These six are independent,
  so one unreadable file must cost that file only: driven with a poisoned `knowledge.db`, the other
  three merged and the `skills` component still restored afterwards.

  **A locked destination is reachable in production.** `restore_main` refuses while the gateway runs,
  but `portability.apply_import_zip` → `_do_replace` has **no gateway gate**, and the gateway holds
  these databases open in WAL mode. Measured: an uncommitted writer holding `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` makes
  the merge print a skip and import nothing, leaving the destination exactly as it was — the same
  shape `_merge_memory` uses for a per-table failure, not a crash and not a partial write.

  The integrity pre-check needed its own test to be honest: the corrupt-file case passes **without**
  it, because `ATTACH` fails and the rollback already protects the destination. The case only the
  pre-check covers is a file sqlite can open and read while `integrity_check` reports damage, so it is
  driven by forcing the pragma's answer — a hand-corrupted file either still reports `ok` (damage in
  free space) or fails to open, and neither reaches that branch.

  Tests: 9 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (90 in that file). Every half verified load-bearing
  by unwiring it independently — wiring, rebuild, FTS skip and integrity pre-check each fail their own
  test alone. Gate: `make lint` green · full `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

## Execution log — Session 2i (the file-shaped stores, and the sweep's end)

- [2026-08-05][S181] **DONE.** Closed the last two declared strategies. `union_by_id` (25 entries) and
  `lww_by_updated_at` (8) had **zero executors** between them.

  **Only the file-shaped entries were broken.** The directory-shaped ones already get entity-level
  union from S177's per-file tree copy, which is the right shape for them. The nine FILE-shaped entries
  were copy-if-missing, so a file the live home already had kept its contents and dropped the
  snapshot's. Driven with each file's real shape, read out of a long-lived home rather than guessed:
  **8 of 8 lost the snapshot side**, including `hooks.json` (the message-pipeline hooks a user
  configured) and `inbox.json`.

  **Per-file, not one generic merge.** The shapes differ — a wrapped list (`{"hooks": [...]}`,
  `{"items": [...]}`), a bare top-level list (`tags.json`), and maps keyed by date (`spend.json`), by
  tool (`tool_usage.json`) or by a composite (`"<month>|<model>|<compressor>"`). More importantly the
  *semantics* differ, so two executors with an explicit per-file wiring beats one that has to infer
  intent from structure.

  🔴 **`durability_state.json` deliberately abstains.** It holds the scheduler's own last-run marks and
  `service._due()` compares them against an interval. Driven against the real function: a stale
  snapshot's `last_snapshot` reads as **due** while the live home's does not, so importing it would
  re-trigger a snapshot immediately, and a union or min would leave the service permanently believing
  it is overdue. Copy-if-missing is the correct semantic here — a wiped home gets its marks back, a
  live home keeps the ones that describe what actually ran.

  🔴 **`spend.json` is real money.** It is the counter a budget ceiling is compared against, one key
  per `%Y-%m-%d`. Combining a snapshot's dollars into a day the live home already has would move a
  spend decision on the basis of money spent on another machine or in another month — pausing a run
  that had budget left, or the reverse. The map merge is per-key with live winning: a day the live home
  lacks is pure recovery, a day it has is authoritative.

  Live rows win throughout, because merge mode's contract is that local state wins and the snapshot
  only fills gaps — a hook the user has since edited must not revert to the archived version.

  🔴 **My probe fixture was wrong, and the code was right.** `tokenjuice_savings.json`'s `rows` is a
  **dict** in production — verified in both homes and against `savings.py` ("Rows are keyed
  `<month>|<model>|<compressor>`") — but my fixture built a list, which made a correct executor look
  inert. The S180 lesson in reverse: check the fixture against the real writer before believing a
  probe's red, not just before believing its green.

  Also covered: idempotence (import once, then zero), a malformed source or destination leaving the
  live copy untouched (these are hand-editable files, so a half-written one is reachable), a row
  carrying no id skipped (it cannot be deduplicated, so importing it would double on the next drill —
  the same non-idempotence the FTS shadow tables showed in S180), and a wrapper mismatch as a no-op
  rather than a guess that writes a document the owning module cannot read.

  Tests: 8 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (98 in that file). Both wirings verified load-bearing
  by unwiring each independently. Gate: `make lint` green · full `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

  **The declared-strategy sweep is now complete.** All five `MERGE_*` strategies have executors or a
  recorded reason not to: `append_dedup` (S176/S178/S179), `sqlite_attach_ignore` (S180), and
  `union_by_id` + `lww_by_updated_at` (this session).

  `replace_only`'s 20 entries were checked individually rather than waved through as
  "copy-if-missing by definition". They split three ways and every group already lands on
  copy-if-missing: **6 derived** (`memory_index.db`, `memory.faiss`, `codegraph`, …) which
  `backup_entries()` excludes from a backup at all; **6 secret** (`.env`, `credentials`,
  `sel_hmac.key`, …) which the named `security` component restores copy-if-missing at 0600 and which
  S177 deliberately excluded from the generic path; and **8 plain config** files
  (`config.json`, `active_models.json`, `mcp.json`, …) reached either by the `config` component —
  verified to copy only `if s.is_file() and not d.is_file()` — or by the generic store pass, which is
  copy-if-missing by construction. So the strategy is satisfied, for a different reason per group.

## Execution log — Session 2j (the export leg)

- [2026-08-05][S182] **DONE.** The S176-S181 sweep covered snapshot/restore. `portability.py` is the
  other direction, and it reads the inventory **only** for `EXPORT_EXCLUDE`.

  **`export_entries()` had no consumer here.** `create_export_zip` named **18 of 53** exportable
  entries from three hand-written lists. Driven on a home seeded across the inventory, the zip came
  out holding **three files** — `config.json`, `memory.db`, `MANIFEST.json` — and **30 stores of the
  user's own data were absent**: tasks, projects, agents, prompts, workflows, artifacts,
  entity_settings, sessions, crashes, `inbox.json`, `spend.json`, `security_events.jsonl` and more.
  This is the feature the plan describes as *"give me everything Gideon knows about me" is one
  click*.

  The source's own comments record the same defect being closed one entry at a time — `triggers.json`
  ("a snapshot of a home with two automations … captured `config.json` ALONE"), then `cron-history`.
  Deriving the remainder from the inventory is what stops the next store being forgotten. The three
  literal lists are **subtracted, not replaced**: each encodes a per-entry reason (the safe sqlite
  backup API, the `skills/auto` skip, the `crons.json` read-only note) that a generic pass would lose.

  🔴 **My own widening introduced the WAL hazard, and driving it caught me.** `workflows/runs.db` and
  `loop/loops.db` sit INSIDE declared trees, so the new tree walk's `rglob` reached them — and a
  filesystem copy of a live WAL store takes the `.db` without its `-wal`. Measured on a store with
  2000 committed rows and a 237 KB uncheckpointed WAL, the raw copy was not merely short: it was
  **unusable** (`no such table: runs`). Every declared database now goes through `_wal_checkpoint` +
  `_backup_sqlite`, and the tree walk skips `*.db` and its sidecars — the same split the snapshot path
  makes with `_tree_ignore_dbs`. Re-driven: 2000/2000 rows survive, zero sidecars in the zip.

  🔴 **The IMPORT side was a fourth hand-written list.** Widening the export is only half a round
  trip: driven end to end, an export carrying `tasks/`, `projects/` and `inbox.json` imported **none
  of them**, reporting `['memory (copied)', 'config (restored)']`. Now widened too — copy-if-missing,
  matching `_copy_tree_no_overwrite` beside it, because the archive came from somewhere else and the
  receiving home's own state is authoritative. The snapshot restore path owns the richer per-store
  merges; an import is deliberately the conservative direction. The existing per-entry decisions are
  untouched (`learning.db` copy-only so evidence is not double-counted, `feedback.jsonl` copy-only,
  `cron-history` no-overwrite).

  **A real asymmetry recorded rather than flipped:** a snapshot carries `uploads/` (verified in both
  `_everything_paths` and `_extra_restore_paths`) and an export excludes it via `EXCLUDE_DIRS`. That
  is defensible — a snapshot is a local 0600 archive of this machine, while an export is the artifact
  a user hands to another machine or attaches to a bug report, and uploads are arbitrary
  user-supplied binaries of unbounded size. Changing an export's contents is a product decision, not
  a sweep's, so the reasoning is now written down and pinned by a test instead of being flipped by the
  next reader.

  **Security.** An export is the artifact most able to leak, so the no-secret assertion is made on the
  **bytes** of every zip member rather than on filenames: `.env`, `.local_secret`, `sel_hmac.key`,
  `telemetry_salt`, `session_map.json`, `session_key` and `credentials/` all stay out. The projection
  reads `export_entries()`, which excludes `secret=True` and `derived=True` by construction, so a
  credential cannot arrive here by being newly declared.

  Tests: 8 new cases in `tests/test_portability.py` (59 in that file), including a full
  export→import round trip and a nested live database asserted on ROWS read back, not on a filename.
  All three halves verified load-bearing by unwiring each independently.

  **Deviation:** a blanket line-rewrapper I used for lint broke pre-existing `# noqa: E501` strings in
  the test file (an unterminated multi-line SQL literal). Recovered by restoring the file from git and
  re-appending only my own block from the stash — recorded because the lesson is that a formatting
  sweep must not touch lines it did not author.

## Execution log — Session 2k (the merge plan)

- [2026-08-05][S183] **DONE.** Closed gap (2), and stated gap (3) where a user can see it.

  **The defect.** `--dry-run` previewed a restore by listing the filenames in the archive, and **0 of
  12** `_merge_*` helpers took a `dry_run` parameter. Driven side by side on one fixture: the dry run
  listed three filenames, while the merge imported one notification, recovered two stores, and left
  `config.json` untouched. The preview answered a different question from the one a user about to
  merge into their own home is asking.

  That also closes **gap (3)** — "config merge is copy-if-missing per file … this contract must be
  stated and tested, not incidental". It was true but *unstated*, so nothing told the user their
  config was protected. The plan now prints
  `KEEP config.json [replace_only] — copy-if-missing; never overwritten`.

  🔴 **DEVIATION from T2-M2, deliberately.** The task row specifies *"`dry_run` threaded through every
  `_merge_*`"*. I did not build that. Twelve flags are twelve chances for the preview to drift from
  the act, and S176–S182 had just added six more executors to thread — the row was written when there
  were four. Instead `merge_plan()` is **computed from the same projections `_do_merge` uses**, and
  the sqlite path list was extracted into a shared `_attach_merge_paths()` so the two cannot disagree
  about which databases participate. Pinned by a test asserting both read that helper.

  The plan's own done-when is met either way: "plan counts match the subsequent real merge exactly on
  the same fixture; nothing written in plan mode (dir hash unchanged)". Verified plan-vs-act —
  `MERGE notifications.jsonl [append_dedup]`, `COPY tasks`, `COPY inbox.json`, `KEEP config.json` —
  and the act did exactly that. Write-freeness is asserted by hashing the home before and after the
  dry run, not by inspection.

  **Replace mode keeps a wholesale preview**, plus the thing a user actually needs told: where the
  current state goes (`pre-restore-<timestamp>/`). A per-entry merge table there would be misleading,
  because replace is wholesale by definition — the recoverability is the safety property.

  🔴 **Two of my own S180 tests went red and were right to.** They asserted on a substring of
  `_do_merge`'s source, which no longer holds the path list after the extraction. Updated to assert
  the shared helper's **output** — the behaviour — rather than one caller's text. A test coupled to
  where code lives rather than what it does will fail every honest refactor.

  Also verified: the plan respects `--components` (a plan for `--components memory` must not list the
  whole home, or the preview overstates a targeted restore), and only entries the archive actually
  holds appear (otherwise the plan becomes a manifest of the inventory rather than of this snapshot).

  **Not in scope, recorded:** `durability/shards.py` has `export_shards`, `validate` and
  `export_and_validate` but **no import/restore function at all** — the hourly shard export that
  "bounds a loss to one hour" is write-only, so those shards are recoverable only by archaeology. That
  is Session 3's `pull → merge-import → export-union → push`, not a gap in this one; noted here so it
  is not rediscovered as a surprise.

  Tests: 6 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (105 in that file). Both halves verified load-bearing
  by unwiring each independently. Gate: `make lint` green · full `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` green.

## Execution log — Session 2l (the restore endpoint, and the non-emptiness test that was wrong)

- **DONE (T2-M3 + the API restore leg).** Two defects, each found by driving a real home rather than
  reading the code.

  🔴 **The auto-detect default was keyed on one file.** `restore_main` chose its mode with
  `"merge" if (pc / "memory.db").is_file() else "replace"`. Measured on a home holding six declared
  stores but no embeddings (tasks, projects, workflows, entity_settings, inbox.json, triggers.json):
  the home read as EMPTY and defaulted to REPLACE, so `tasks/mine.json` and the user's automation were
  moved into `pre-restore-<ts>/` and the snapshot's copies took their place. Recoverable, so a wrong
  DEFAULT rather than data loss — which is exactly the plan's stated fear ("replace-mode restores
  there destroy the newer half"). Fixed with `home_is_populated()`, which asks the inventory: any
  non-derived, non-secret declared store present counts, so the home's emptiness no longer hinges on
  whether it ever embedded anything. `config.json`/`session_map.json`/`machine_id` are excluded — the
  first is written at first boot, so counting it would push a genuine first-time restore onto the
  merge path; the other two are machine-local bookkeeping. Secrets are excluded because the list is
  surfaced over the API.

  **The API had no restore.** `POST /api/durability/restore` was named in T2-M3 and absent — the
  dashboard could take a backup and could not restore one. Added, mirroring the CLI exactly by sharing
  `merge_plan()`: omitting `mode` returns the plan and writes nothing (safe default for an endpoint
  that can overwrite a home — replace is therefore always deliberate), and `restore_apply` refuses
  while the gateway runs just as the CLI does. No `--force`/`force` mirror on purpose: overriding the
  running-gateway guard is a local operator decision at a terminal, not an HTTP surface. Path
  containment on the archive name (must resolve inside the snapshot dir) so a caller cannot point a
  restore at an arbitrary tar.

  🔴 **`triggers.json` was never in the inventory.** `triggers/store.py` is "the one trigger store …
  absorbing crons.json / hooks.json / event_triggers.json", hand-listed in both `snapshot.py` and
  `portability.py`, yet no inventory entry declared it — so it was invisible to `home_is_populated`,
  the coverage ratchet, and every projection S176-S183 built. `audit_home()` WOULD have flagged it
  (verified: it reports `triggers.json` unclaimed on a home that has one); S179 audited both real
  homes clean only because neither has migrated to the store yet, so the guard was right and the
  population was the gap — the same fixture-versus-reality shape S179 was about. Added as
  `union_by_id`; `crons`/`hooks`/`event_triggers` re-annotated legacy read-only.

  Tests: 6 new cases in `tests/test_snapshot.py` (111 in that file) — populated-without-memory.db
  proposes MERGE, fresh install still REPLACE, the populated list names no secret, a MERGE into a
  populated home keeps local work, the plan writes nothing (home hashed before/after), apply refuses
  under a running gateway. DEVIATION: regenerated `src/gideon/reference/{index,routes}.md` — the
  offline reference is route-derived and the new endpoint is a real route, so `test_agent_reference`
  correctly went red until regenerated. Gate: `make lint` green (1337 files) · full
  `pytest -n 4 --dist worksteal` → 16401 passed, 29 skipped, 12 xfailed.

## Execution log — DAS-6a (the sync-transport contract; DAS-6 re-scoped)

- **DAS-6 RE-SCOPED into sub-atoms; DAS-6a DONE.** DAS-6's `done_when` spanned eight
  deliverables (contract + registry + SDK + shard import + a CAS/outbox/cursor cycle engine +
  per-strategy merges + two sync apps + convergence) — too large for one atomic PR (three prior
  implementation subagents stalled on it). Split, contract-owner-first (the pattern WS-1 used):
  **DAS-6a = §4.3 the transport contract only.** Added `sync_transports/` — `SyncTransportProvider`
  ABC (`push`/`list_remote`/`pull`/`cas_registry`/`test`, all insert-only + idempotent on key) with
  `SyncObject`/`RemoteRef`/`PushResult`/`ConnectionResult`, and a flat `register/get/unregister`
  registry mirroring `channel_transports`. Re-exported via `sdk/sync.py`. Added `sync` to
  `PROVIDER_TYPES` AND a real `SyncTypeHandler` (registers a transport into `sync_transports`) in the
  SAME commit — the #47 rule; parity test green. Applied the same lazy-`deregister` fix as WS-1 (no
  eager `getattr` default that dereferences a None `ext`). **Remaining DAS-6 sub-atoms (not started):**
  DAS-6b shard import/restore (S2k noted shards were write-only); DAS-6c the sync cycle engine
  (pull→merge-import→export-union→push, registry.json machine-seq CAS retry, stale_after_secs, durable
  outbox + consumed-only cursor, per-strategy merges + tombstones, derived-index rebuild); DAS-6d the
  git-sync + dir-sync first-party apps + convergence (criterion 4). Contract-only; no user surface yet
  → no CHANGELOG entry. **Gates:** `make lint` clean (696 source files); `test_sync_transport_contract.py`
  (6) + `test_app_manifest.py` (#47 parity) + `test_provider_registry.py` = 66 passed.

- **DAS-6a CI fix (amended):** adding `sync` to `PROVIDER_TYPES` drifted the checked-in offline
  reference `src/gideon/reference/providers.md` (a generated artifact — `test_agent_reference.py`
  byte-matches it against a fresh `render_reference()`). Regenerated via `python -m
  gideon.manifest_reference` and amended into the DAS-6a commit; cascade-rebased CATO-1 + PCS-2.
  Lesson: a new `PROVIDER_TYPES` entry MUST regenerate `reference/providers.md` in the same commit —
  the full-suite `test` job catches it even when file-scoped tests + `make lint` are green.

- **DAS-6b DONE — the shard IMPORT (read) side.** S2k shipped `shards.py` write-only: shards could be
  produced + `validate`d but nothing read them back. Added `import_shards(shard_dir, entries=None) ->
  ImportResult` — the exact inverse of `export_shards`' row extraction: it `validate`s first (a shard
  whose bytes/sha/row-count drifted from the manifest is untrustworthy input for a merge/restore, so a
  failed validation RAISES rather than importing silently-corrupt data), then reads every declared
  shard in manifest order into `{entry_id: [rows]}`, reassembling across sqlite tables, year buckets,
  and deterministic `part-NNNN` splits into one flat order-preserving list per entry. `ImportResult`
  also enumerates content-addressed `blobs/` (KIND_TREE payloads) and carries the source `machine_id`.
  Scope: the read primitive ONLY — the restore-into-live-home-with-merges and the pull→merge→push
  cycle are DAS-6c; two-machine convergence is DAS-6d. Contract/primitive, no user surface → no
  CHANGELOG. **Gates:** `make lint` clean (697 files); `tests/test_durability_shards.py::TestImport`
  (8: full round-trip row-count/entry parity, entity-dir by-id, sqlite-table reassembly, year-bucket
  merge, secrets-absent, entries-filter, invalid-export-refuses, part-split reassembly-in-order) +
  the full shards suite = 36 passed.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-i (the row-level merge core; DAS-6c re-scoped)

- **DAS-6c RE-SCOPED; DAS-6c-i DONE.** The DAS-6c cycle clause (pull→merge-import→export-union→push
  with CAS registry + staleness window + durable outbox + consumed-only cursor + deterministic
  per-strategy merges + tombstones) is genuinely multi-mechanism, so it's split like DAS-6 itself:
  **6c-i = the deterministic row-level MERGE core** (this), 6c-ii = the cycle orchestration
  (registry.json machine-seqs / CAS retry / stale_after_secs / outbox / cursor) that composes 6a's
  transport + 6b's `import_shards` + this merge. Added `durability/merge.py`: pure, clock-free,
  deterministic `merge_union_by_id` / `merge_lww_by_updated_at` / `merge_append_dedup` + a
  `merge_rows(strategy, ...)` dispatcher over `inventory.MERGE_*`. Tombstone-aware (a `deleted_at` row
  wins over a live same-id row — deletion survives the union; later `deleted_at` wins between two
  tombstones; a tombstone beats even a newer live `updated_at`). LWW ties favor local (stable);
  append_dedup by a stable per-row key makes a re-import a no-op. `sqlite_attach_ignore`/`replace_only`
  RAISE from `merge_rows` (the cycle handles DBs via attach-ignore + skips replace_only — routing one
  here is a caller bug). No CRDTs — union+LWW+tombstones per the plan's Anti-goals. Proved the
  done-when convergence properties at the row layer: two machines merging each other's rows converge
  to the same set; a delete on A stays deleted on B; merge is idempotent (re-applying an unchanged
  remote changes nothing — the free-retry-on-CAS-race property). Pure core, no user surface → no
  CHANGELOG. **Remaining:** DAS-6c-ii (cycle orchestration + registry/CAS/outbox/cursor), DAS-6d
  (git-sync + dir-sync apps + two-machine convergence). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (700 files);
  `tests/test_durability_merge.py` (21: per-strategy, tombstone precedence, LWW ties/undated,
  append no-op, dispatch guards, convergence + idempotency) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-a (the versioned registry model; DAS-6c-ii re-scoped)

- **DAS-6c-ii RE-SCOPED; DAS-6c-ii-a DONE.** The DAS-6c-ii cycle orchestration is itself
  multi-mechanism (versioned registry + CAS-retry loop + durable outbox/consumed-only cursor +
  the pull→merge-import→export-union→push engine), so it splits like DAS-6/6c before it. First
  completable sub-atom = the **pure registry model** every other piece turns on. Added
  `durability/registry.py`: `Registry`/`MachineEntry` parse & canonically serialize `registry.json`
  (`{"machines": {id: {seq, last_export_at, manifest_sha}}}`), `.sha()` over the canonical bytes
  (the `expected_sha` a CAS compares — `canonical_json` reused so two machines writing the same
  logical registry produce byte-identical output), `bump()` monotonic seq advance on a fresh export
  (a stale registry from a lost race can never lower the mark), `shard_prefix(id, seq)` = the
  insert-only `machines/<id>/seq-NNNN/` key (zero-padded so a lexical list-sort is chronological),
  and the peer-discovery seam the cycle drains through: `new_prefixes_since(self, seen)` yields
  exactly the unseen peer shard prefixes ascending (cursor-driven, re-poll idempotent) and
  `advanced_over(prior, self_id)` reports who moved during a mid-cycle re-pull. Clock-free (the
  timestamp is passed in) and I/O-free — the transport owns the CAS write (`cas_registry`, 6a) and
  6c-ii-b composes model+transport into the retry loop; keeping the model pure is what makes the
  CAS contract testable without a remote and a lost-race retry free. Corrupt/forward-version fields
  degrade to 0 (re-publish), a genuinely unparseable registry RAISES (a mis-parsed coordinator would
  let two machines both own a seq). Pure core, no user surface → no CHANGELOG. **Remaining:**
  6c-ii-b (CAS-retry push loop + durable outbox + consumed-only cursor), 6c-ii-c (the
  pull→merge-import→export-union engine composing 6a transport + 6b import + 6c-i merge + this
  registry), DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync apps + criterion-4 two-machine convergence). **Gates:**
  `make lint` clean (701 files); `tests/test_durability_registry.py` (23: prefix zero-pad/sort,
  canonical byte-stability + sha, empty/corrupt/malformed handling, monotonic bump, peer ordering,
  cursor-driven `new_prefixes_since` + idempotent re-poll, `advanced_over`) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-b (durable outbox + consumed-only cursor)

- **DAS-6c-ii-b DONE.** The two durable-state halves the cycle engine (6c-ii-c) reads/writes,
  built as pure bookkeeping over on-disk JSON (clock-free — timestamps passed in — so a replay
  is deterministic). Added `durability/outbox.py`: one file per (target, seq) under
  `<sync_root>/outbox/`, so a push obligation survives a crash/restart. Statuses
  `pending|delivered|given-up`; deliverer outcomes `delivered|transient|permanent`, applied by
  `record_outcome` — `delivered`→terminal delivered, `permanent`→terminal given-up, and
  **anything else (transient OR an unclassified throw) leaves it pending + bumps attempts**, so a
  push is discharged only by a real success or an explicit permanent failure, never silently
  dropped (§4.1 verbatim). Per-(target,seq) files mean **one target giving up never blocks
  another's drain** (`pending()` excludes terminals). `enqueue` is idempotent on (target, seq) —
  re-enqueue after a crash never resets a delivered entry; target names are path-separator-scrubbed
  so an entry file can't escape the outbox dir; a corrupt entry file is skipped, not fatal. Added
  `durability/cursor.py`: the consumed-only pull cursor — the `seen` map `Registry.new_prefixes_since`
  reads. `record(peer, seq, verdict)` advances the per-peer high-water mark **only** on `consumed`
  or `payload-bad` (the latter advances past a poison shard so it can't wedge every later seq, and
  logs); `prerequisite-absent` **holds** (out-of-order arrival retried next cycle); advancement is
  monotonic (a stale/replayed verdict is a no-op); `seen()` returns a copy; a corrupt cursor file
  degrades to empty. Pure state layer, no user surface → no CHANGELOG. **Remaining:** 6c-ii-c (the
  pull→merge-import→export-union→push engine composing 6a transport + 6b import + 6c-i merge + 6c-ii-a
  registry + this outbox/cursor, with the CAS retry loop + staleness window), then DAS-6d (git-sync +
  dir-sync apps + criterion-4 two-machine convergence). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (703 files);
  `tests/test_durability_outbox.py` (23: enqueue idempotency, all four outcome→status transitions incl.
  unclassified-as-transient, one-target-give-up-doesn't-block-others, persistence across handles, stats,
  corrupt-file skip; cursor consumed/hold/payload-bad/monotonic/copy/unknown-verdict/reload/corrupt) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-c (apply merged rows back to the live store)

- **DAS-6c-ii-c DONE.** The sync cycle's last pure primitive: `durability/writeback.py::apply_rows`,
  the exact inverse of `shards.py`'s per-kind row *extraction*. After `merge` reconciles a peer's
  rows with the local ones, this writes the merged set back into each inventory entry's native
  on-disk shape, dispatched by `kind` — the mirror of `export_shards`' dispatch, so a round-trip
  (extract → apply) reproduces the same files (proven by tests re-extracting the written output).
  `json_entity_dir` → one JSON file per `{"id","data"}` row (a `deleted_at` **tombstone** row
  removes the file, so a peer's delete propagates instead of resurrecting); `json_file` → the one
  row's `data` (tombstone removes; >1 row is a merge bug → last-wins + warn); `jsonl_append` →
  canonical JSONL, year-sharded exactly as the exporter shards a directory stream
  (`<dest>/<year>.jsonl`) or one file for a single-file stream, order preserved. `sqlite`/`tree`
  RAISE (the cycle merges DBs via ATTACH-OR-IGNORE — `snapshot.py` — and rehydrates tree payloads
  from the content-addressed blob store), mirroring `merge.merge_rows`; unknown kind raises. Atomic
  per file (temp + rename). A malformed row is skipped + logged, never fatal. Pure primitive, no
  user surface → no CHANGELOG. **Remaining:** 6c-ii-d — the ENGINE that orchestrates these pure
  pieces (pull via 6a transport → import_shards 6b → merge_rows 6c-i / ATTACH-IGNORE for DBs →
  apply_rows this → export union → push, with the 6c-ii-a registry CAS-retry loop, 6c-ii-b
  outbox/cursor, and stale_after_secs staleness window), then DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync apps +
  criterion-4 two-machine convergence). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (704 files);
  `tests/test_durability_writeback.py` (14: entity-dir write/round-trip/tombstone/skip, json-file
  write/empty/tombstone/last-wins, jsonl single-file + year-shard + round-trip, sqlite/tree/unknown
  raises) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-d (reconcile a peer's rows into the live store)

- **DAS-6c-ii-d DONE.** The bridge that turns "I pulled a peer's shards" into "the peer's rows
  are now in my live store", composing the three pure pieces already shipped:
  `durability/reconcile.py::reconcile_entry(home, entry, remote_rows)` reads the entry's on-disk
  rows the SAME way `export_shards` extracts them (so both sides of the merge speak one row shape
  — the invariant convergence depends on) → `merge.merge_rows(entry.merge, local, remote,
  tombstones=entry.tombstones)` → `writeback.apply_rows(entry.kind, dest, merged.rows)`. Row path
  only: for a `sqlite` entry (merged by ATTACH-OR-IGNORE in `snapshot.py`) or a `tree` entry
  (rehydrated from the content-addressed blob store) it DECLINES — returns `handled=False` so the
  cycle engine routes it to the DB/blob path, rather than raising. Returns a cursor verdict
  (`ReconcileResult.verdict`): `consumed` on a clean merge; a row entry that throws mid-merge is
  caught and reported `payload-bad` (with `handled=True`) so one poison entry advances the cursor
  past itself instead of aborting the whole pull (§4.1). Proves **criterion 4 at the reconcile
  layer**: two machines each reconciling the other's rows converge to the same id set; a
  tombstoned delete on A stays deleted on B (no resurrection). Pure bridge over pure pieces, no
  transport, no user surface → no CHANGELOG. **Remaining:** 6c-ii-e — the transport-driven ENGINE
  (walk the 6c-ii-a registry's `new_prefixes_since`, pull each prefix via the 6a transport,
  `import_shards` 6b, route each entry through `reconcile_entry` OR the sqlite ATTACH-IGNORE path,
  record the 6c-ii-b cursor verdict, then export-union + push through the outbox with the registry
  CAS-retry loop + `stale_after_secs` window), then DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync apps as installable
  `sync` provider apps + the end-to-end criterion-4 convergence over a real git repo/folder).
  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (705 files); `tests/test_durability_reconcile.py` (9: remote-only
  brought in, empty-local takes all, tombstone delete propagates, two-machine convergence,
  delete-stays-deleted, sqlite/tree declined, handles_kind predicate, poison→payload-bad) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-e (transport-driven pull engine)

- **DAS-6c-ii-e DONE.** Where the pure pieces meet a real remote: `durability/pull_engine.py`.
  `pull_from_peers(transport, home, registry, cursor, *, self_id, db_merger=None)` walks each
  peer's unseen shard sets oldest-first (`registry.peers` × cursor gap), and per seq:
  `transport.list_remote(prefix)` → `transport.pull(refs)` → `_materialize` into a validatable
  shard dir (strip the `machines/<id>/seq-NNNN/` prefix) → `import_shards` (6b, validates +
  reassembles) → route each entry through `reconcile.reconcile_entry` (6c-i+c+d) → aggregate a
  cursor verdict → `cursor.record` (6c-ii-b, consumed-only). **DISCOVERY (recon):** the sqlite
  export is deliberately LOSSY — `_sqlite_rows` stores byte/embedding columns as `{"__bytes__": n}`
  size placeholders and `_sqlite_tables` drops FTS shadow tables (derived) — so a `sqlite`/`tree`
  entry can NOT be losslessly rebuilt from row shards; it needs the DB-to-DB ATTACH path
  (`snapshot._merge_sqlite_attach`) and an embeddings-rebuilt-vs-round-tripped decision. That is
  6c-ii-f's design call, NOT a blocker here: the DB path is an **injected `db_merger` seam**, and
  until it's supplied a seq containing a DB/unknown entry is **HELD** (cursor not advanced,
  re-pulled next cycle) rather than silently skipping unmerged database data (§4.1: advance only
  on consumed rows). The row-entry convergence path (criterion 4 — tasks, entity dirs, JSONL) is
  fully live today. Also faithful to §4.1: a partial push (prefix announced but no bytes) HOLDS;
  an unknown entry id HOLDS (an older reader never drops a newer peer's entry); a structurally
  invalid import → `payload-bad` (advance past it); and a held seq **stops contiguity** so seq+1
  isn't pulled past its unmet prerequisite. **Remaining:** 6c-ii-f (the DB/tree `db_merger`
  implementation — ATTACH-IGNORE for DBs incl. the embeddings decision, blob rehydrate for trees;
  its own tick), 6c-ii-g (the push half: export-union + CAS-retry registry bump + outbox drain +
  `stale_after_secs`), then wire the whole cycle into `service.py::run_due_jobs` and DAS-6d
  (git-sync/dir-sync installable `sync` apps + end-to-end criterion-4 over a real git repo/folder).
  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (706 files); `tests/test_durability_pull_engine.py` (6, driven by an
  in-memory `FakeTransport`: pull+reconcile a peer seq into the live store, cursor skips already-seen,
  partial-push holds, held-seq stops contiguity, DB entry holds without a merger, DB seam lets it
  advance) pass.

### Design note for DAS-6c-ii-f (the DB/tree db_merger) — decided, precedent-matching (no owner block)

The 6c-ii-e recon surfaced the fork and it resolves cleanly against existing behavior, so the DB
merger is a defensible clean-break, not an escalation:

- **Sqlite entries sync the real DB file, not the lossy row shards.** `_sqlite_rows` intentionally
  replaces byte/embedding columns with `{"__bytes__": n}` placeholders (human-diffable shards), so
  row shards can NOT rebuild a DB losslessly. The snapshot path already proves the answer:
  `_merge_memory` carries the `embedding` column and `_merge_sqlite_attach` ATTACH-merges every
  real table with `INSERT OR IGNORE`. So 6c-ii-f: (a) the export stages a **consistent DB copy**
  for each `KIND_SQLITE` entry (reusing `_consistent_db_copy`, already present — sqlite backup API,
  WAL-checkpointed) under a `db/<entry>.db` path in the shard set, alongside the diffable rows;
  (b) `import_shards`/`ImportResult` surfaces that DB path; (c) the `db_merger` ATTACHes it via the
  existing `snapshot._merge_sqlite_attach` (memory.db keeps its `is_deleted=0` executor so deletes
  aren't resurrected).
- **Derived indexes are rebuilt, never synced** — `memory.faiss` / `memory_index.db` are
  `derived=True`; the merger rebuilds them locally after the ATTACH (the FTS `'rebuild'` command the
  snapshot path already runs), matching §4.1 "indexes rebuilt on import, never synced". Embeddings
  themselves live IN `memory.db` and ride the ATTACH (they are NOT rebuilt — carrying them is the
  snapshot precedent), so a synced memory is searchable without re-embedding.
- **Tree entries** rehydrate from the content-addressed `blobs/` the exporter already writes.
This keeps the whole thing lossless, reuses proven machinery, and needs no new format concept
beyond staging the DB copy the exporter already knows how to make.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-f (transport-driven push engine)

- **DAS-6c-ii-f DONE. (Note: the DB/tree db_merger — earlier called 6c-ii-f — is renumbered
  6c-ii-g; the push half is taken first because it's self-contained and doesn't touch the fragile
  shard export format.)** `durability/push_engine.py::publish_export` is the mirror of the pull
  engine: `registry.bump(self_id, …)` (6c-ii-a, monotonic) → keys every file of a fresh
  `export_shards` dir under `machines/<self_id>/seq-NNNN/<rel>` (exact inverse of the pull engine's
  `_materialize`) → **records the durable outbox obligation FIRST** (6c-ii-b) so a crash between
  push and registry-commit leaves a pending entry the next cycle re-drains (insert-only keys make
  that a no-op) → `transport.push` → `outbox.record_outcome` → **only on a delivered push**,
  CAS-commit the registry via `transport.cas_registry(expected_sha, registry.to_bytes())`. A
  transient/permanent push does NOT announce the seq (a peer must never pull a prefix whose objects
  are missing) — the outbox retries. On a lost CAS race the loop calls an injected
  `reload_registry()`, re-applies our bump on top of the peers' latest, carries peers' higher seqs
  forward, and retries — bounded to 5 attempts so a pathological race can't spin (idempotent object
  keys make each retry free, per §4.1). Clock-free (timestamp passed in). Composes only
  already-shipped pieces; touches no export-format code. No user surface yet → no CHANGELOG.
  **Remaining:** 6c-ii-g (the DB/tree `db_merger` + the shard-format extension to carry consistent
  DB copies — the design decided in the note above: DB-file ATTACH, not lossy rows; `import_shards`
  can't carry a binary `.db` in its JSONL `shards` list, so this needs a parallel manifest field
  next to `blobs`), then 6c-ii-h (assemble pull+push into one `run_sync_cycle` with the
  `stale_after_secs` window + wire into `service.py::run_due_jobs` + `DurabilityConfig.sync_*`), then
  DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync installable `sync` apps + end-to-end criterion-4 over a real git
  repo/folder). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (707 files); `tests/test_durability_push_engine.py`
  (7: publishes objects + commits registry, obligation-before-push, transient-doesn't-announce,
  monotonic seq across publishes, lost-race-then-win reload+retry preserving both seqs, no-reloader
  gives up, persistent race gives up bounded at 5) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-g (whole-DB copies in the shard format)

- **DAS-6c-ii-g DONE (the format half of the DB path).** The diffable row shards store
  embedding/byte columns as `{"__bytes__": n}` placeholders, so they can't rebuild a DB
  losslessly. Extended the shard format to carry the real database: `export_shards` gains a
  keyword-only `include_databases=False` — when a SYNC export sets it True, each `KIND_SQLITE`
  entry additionally stages its already-consistent backup-API copy (the one the exporter already
  makes for row extraction — no second live read) under `db/<entry_id>.db`, recorded as a new
  `DbCopy` in `ExportResult.databases` and declared in the manifest's new `databases` list.
  `validate()` verifies each DB copy's bytes + sha256 (a corrupted copy is named), and treats an
  absent `databases` key as valid (a row-only/incremental export). `import_shards` surfaces
  `ImportResult.databases` = `{entry_id: db/<entry>.db}` (respecting the `entries` filter) so the
  6c-ii-h DB merger can ATTACH the real database. **The hourly incremental backup path is
  untouched** — it never passes `include_databases`, so its byte-for-byte determinism (DB files
  aren't byte-stable across runs by nature) and all 33 existing `test_durability_shards.py` cases
  still pass, and `test_snapshot.py` (111) is green. The row shards are STILL written alongside the
  DB (human-diffable review + the append/entity merge paths); the DB copy is only the merge source
  for sqlite entries. Clean break; the new field has its consumer in 6c-ii-h. No user surface → no
  CHANGELOG. **Remaining:** 6c-ii-h (the DB merger seam itself — `db_merger(entry, shard_dir)` that
  ATTACHes `import_shards().databases[entry.id]` via `snapshot._merge_sqlite_attach`, keeping
  memory.db's `is_deleted=0` executor, then rebuilds derived faiss/index — the callback the pull
  engine already accepts + `include_databases=True` on the push engine's export), then 6c-ii-i
  (assemble `run_sync_cycle` + `stale_after_secs` + service wiring + `DurabilityConfig.sync_*`),
  then DAS-6d (git/dir-sync apps + e2e criterion-4). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (707 files);
  `tests/test_durability_db_shards.py` (13: default stages nothing, sync stages a lossless openable
  DB, rows written alongside, manifest declares dbs, validate passes + catches a corrupted copy +
  accepts a row-only export, import maps entry→path + respects the filter, determinism untouched) +
  `test_durability_shards.py` (33) + `test_snapshot.py` (111) all pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-h (the sqlite DB-merge seam)

- **DAS-6c-ii-h DONE.** `durability/db_merge.py::make_db_merger(home)` returns the
  `db_merger(entry, shard_dir)` callback the pull engine already accepts (6c-ii-e) for the
  `sqlite`/`tree` entries it declines to row-merge. It finds the whole-DB copy the exporter staged
  under `db/<entry_id>.db` (6c-ii-g) and ATTACH-merges it into the live DB, reusing the PROVEN
  snapshot machinery rather than a second copy: `memory.db` → `snapshot._merge_memory` (the
  4-table `WHERE is_deleted=0` allowlist, so a synced copy never RESURRECTS a deleted memory);
  every other `KIND_SQLITE` entry → `snapshot._merge_sqlite_attach` (all real tables `INSERT OR
  IGNORE`, FTS shadow tables skipped). A first sync onto a fresh machine (no live DB yet) copies
  the source wholesale (lossless, incl. embeddings). Embeddings ride the ATTACH (they live IN the
  DB — the snapshot precedent); derived `memory.faiss`/`memory_index.db` are NOT synced and rebuild
  locally (boot rebuild + heartbeat reindex), per §4.1 "indexes rebuilt on import, never synced".
  Verdicts: `consumed` on a clean merge (and for a `tree` entry — nothing to merge, derived);
  `prerequisite-absent` when a sqlite entry arrived with no staged DB copy (a row-only export
  mis-routed — hold, don't advance past unmerged data); `payload-bad` when the merge itself throws
  (advance past a poison DB). Proven end-to-end THROUGH the pull engine: a peer's real `memory.db`
  row syncs onto a fresh machine via `pull_from_peers(..., db_merger=make_db_merger(local))`. No
  change needed to the push engine — `include_databases=True` is the caller's (6c-ii-i's) concern.
  Clean break, reuses snapshot's merge functions; no user surface → no CHANGELOG. **Remaining:**
  6c-ii-i (assemble `run_sync_cycle` = pull(db_merger) + push(include_databases=True) with the
  `stale_after_secs` window, wired into `service.py::run_due_jobs` + `DurabilityConfig.sync_*`), then
  DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync installable `sync` apps + end-to-end criterion-4 over a real git
  repo/folder). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (708 files); `tests/test_durability_db_merge.py` (7:
  fresh-machine wholesale copy, INSERT-OR-IGNORE union keeps local + brings remote-only,
  memory.db routes through `_merge_memory` not the generic path, tree consumed, missing-copy holds,
  corrupt-merge payload-bad, end-to-end peer-DB-syncs-onto-fresh-machine through the pull engine) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-i (assemble run_sync_cycle) + two discoveries

- **DAS-6c-ii-i DONE.** `durability/sync_cycle.py::run_sync_cycle(transport, home, *, self_id, …)`
  assembles every piece into the §4.1 loop: `read_registry(transport)` (the one new transport
  read — pulls + parses `registry.json`, absent → empty) → `pull_from_peers(..., db_merger=
  make_db_merger(home))` (6c-ii-e + 6c-ii-h) → `export_shards(home, out, include_databases=True)`
  (6b + 6c-ii-g) → `publish_export(..., reload_registry=lambda: read_registry(transport))`
  (6c-ii-f + CAS bump). Clock-free (`now` passed in); never raises — any transport error lands in
  `SyncCycleReport` so a bad cycle can't kill the service loop. Scheduling (`stale_after_secs`) and
  transport/enabled resolution stay in the service layer (6c-ii-j). **Proves the plan's Success
  Criterion 4 end-to-end** through a shared in-memory store: two machines converge on tasks after a
  cycle each way; a peer's `memory.db` row lands on a fresh machine (DB rides along).
- **DISCOVERY 1 (FIXED here — a real bug the assembly caught).** The exporter wraps an entity file
  as `{"id": <stem>, "data": <content>}`, so a `deleted_at` tombstone (and any LWW field like
  `updated_at`) lives at `row["data"][field]`, NOT the top level. `merge`/`writeback` checked only
  the top level — so tombstone precedence and LWW silently no-op'd for the entity-dir kind (the
  earlier unit tests used synthetic FLAT rows and missed it). Fixed: `merge._field` /
  `writeback._is_tombstone` now check top-level (JSONL streams) then fall back to `data`
  (entity-dir wrappers), so both shapes work. Lesson: a control field's LOCATION is part of the
  contract — unit-test against the REAL producer's row shape, not a hand-built one.
- **DISCOVERY 2 (recorded, its own atom — a producer gap).** `tasks`/`projects` declare
  `tombstones=True`, but `tasks/native.py:delete_task` does a **hard `path.unlink()`** — no
  `deleted_at` marker is ever written. So the tombstone MECHANISM is complete and correct (a
  tombstone that exists is honored end-to-end, verified), but nothing PRODUCES one: a real
  delete-then-sync would resurrect the task via union-merge on a peer that still holds it live.
  Closing this is a distinct cross-cutting change (soft-delete write path + read-path filtering
  across the tasks/projects subsystem + its FE), NOT a bolt-on to the sync engine — filed as
  **DAS-6c-iii (tombstone producers)**. This is the honest edge of the slice: sync is safe for
  create/update convergence today; delete-convergence for tasks/projects waits on 6c-iii.
  **Remaining:** 6c-ii-j (service wiring: `run_due_jobs` sync job + `stale_after_secs` per-process
  memo + `DurabilityConfig.sync_enabled/sync_transport/sync_stale_after_secs` config round-trip),
  6c-iii (tombstone producers), DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync installable apps + e2e over a real git
  repo/folder). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (709 files); `tests/test_durability_sync_cycle.py` (7:
  first-publish, transport-failure contained, two-machine convergence, delete-propagates,
  DB-rides-along, empty/written registry) + the full durability suite (242 passed, 2 skipped) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-ii-j (service wiring + sync config round-trip)

- **DAS-6c-ii-j DONE.** Wired the assembled cycle into the running system. **Config round-trip**
  (the full four-point contract): `DurabilityConfig` gains `sync_enabled` (default False),
  `sync_transport` (default ""), `sync_stale_after_secs` (default 900), each with `_meta`;
  `AppConfig.load()` maps all three explicitly (else they'd silently revert — the leaf-walk
  round-trip test excludes `durability`), with `sync_enabled` **fail-CLOSED** (a garbage value
  reads False — a sync surface must never self-enable, unlike backups which fail-safe ON);
  `asdict` serializes them; `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` allowlists all three (PATCH-editable), and the
  existing `TestConfigContract` allowlist-matches-dataclass test's `_FIELDS` was extended to match.
  **Service due-job:** `service.run_sync_job()` is self-guarding (idle → `skipped` unless
  `sync_enabled` AND a `sync_transport` that resolves in `sync_transports.registry.get_transport`),
  runs under `single_flight("durability:sync")` so it never overlaps an export, never raises (the
  cycle's report carries any error), and audits via SEL. `run_due_jobs` schedules it by the
  **staleness window** (`_due(state, "last_sync", sync_stale_after_secs)`), stamping `last_sync`
  even on skip/failure so a misconfigured sync can't hammer the remote every tick; `status()` now
  reports the sync entry (enabled/transport/due). **Near-miss caught + fixed:** a first draft of a
  schedule test called `run_due_jobs` unstubbed and triggered a real nightly snapshot of the
  actual 1.2 GB `~/.gideon` (pytest-timeout kill) — rewrote `TestDueSchedule` to stub every
  job branch (export/snapshot/drill/save_state) so it asserts only the scheduler's DECISION,
  touching no real home (the destructive-test rule). **Sync is now a live, config-gated, scheduled
  service** — off by default, on with `durability.sync_enabled` + a transport. **Remaining:** 6c-iii
  (tombstone producers — soft-delete tasks/projects so delete-convergence holds), then DAS-6d
  (git-sync + dir-sync installable `sync` transport apps + the end-to-end criterion-4 over a real
  git repo/folder). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (709 files); `tests/test_durability_sync_service.py`
  (10) + `test_durability_service.py` + `test_config_roundtrip.py` + full durability suite
  (257 passed, 2 skipped) pass.

## RESOLVED — DAS-6c-iii owner decision: Fork B (sync-only tombstone side-log), 2026-08-06

Owner chose **Fork B**: hard-delete stays, plus a durability-isolated `_tombstones.jsonl`
side-log — no tasks-subsystem/FE churn, no user-facing undo/retention surface, shipped #809
writeback unchanged. **DAS-6c-iii-a DONE** (the log primitive + export fold); **6c-iii-b** wires
the delete write-sites (`tasks/native.py:delete_task`/`delete_comment`,
`hierarchy.delete_project`/`delete_task_list`) to call `record_tombstone`, and adds the GC to the
sync cycle. See the log entry below the original fork writeup.

## (original fork writeup) DAS-6c-iii tombstone-producer options (2026-08-06)

The sync tombstone MECHANISM is complete and correct end-to-end (verified: a tombstone that
exists propagates a delete and is honored by merge + writeback). But NOTHING produces one:
`tasks/native.py:delete_task` and `delete_comment` hard-`unlink()`, and projects delete the
same way. So delete-CONVERGENCE across machines doesn't hold yet, and closing it forks into two
architectures with different product consequences — a genuine judgment call, not a clean-break I
should pick unilaterally:

- **Fork A — convert tasks/projects to soft-delete.** `delete_*` writes a `deleted_at` marker
  instead of unlinking; every read path (`_read_task`/`_all_tasks`/`list_tasks`/`get_task`,
  hierarchy, comments) filters tombstoned rows; `writeback._apply_entity_dir` PERSISTS the marker
  instead of unlinking (changes the shipped 6c-ii-c behavior). Pros: one row model, the inventory's
  `tombstones=True` is literally true. Cons: touches the whole tasks subsystem + FE + the ACP
  provider; raises a user-facing retention/undo/trash question (tombstone marker files linger — for
  how long? GC policy?) that is really a Tasks-UX decision, not a durability one.
- **Fork B — a sync-only tombstone side-log.** `delete_*` stays a hard unlink (tasks UX unchanged,
  no retention/undo question for the user), but ALSO appends `{id, deleted_at}` to a sync-only
  `tasks/_tombstones.jsonl` the durability layer reads to emit tombstone rows; a GC prunes the log
  past the sync horizon. Pros: zero tasks-subsystem/FE churn, isolates the concern in durability,
  keeps writeback's current unlink-on-apply. Cons: a second delete write-site to keep in step; a
  new side-file kind for the inventory/exporter to carry.

Recording BLOCKED here and moving on rather than guessing — the choice changes core tasks
semantics (A) vs. a durability-local mechanism (B), and it decides whether shipped #809's
writeback unlink is final or must persist markers. Everything through #819 is unaffected: sync is
OFF by default and has no tombstone producers, so create/update convergence (Criterion 4's build
half) is live and safe today; only cross-machine DELETE convergence waits on this decision.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-iii-a (tombstone side-log primitive + export fold; owner Fork B)

- **DAS-6c-iii-a DONE.** `durability/tombstones.py` — the sync-only delete side-log Fork B calls
  for. `record_tombstone(entry_dir, row_id, *, now)` appends `{"id", "deleted_at"}` to
  `<entry_dir>/_tombstones.jsonl` (best-effort, never raises — a delete must not fail because its
  sync breadcrumb couldn't be written). `read_tombstones` returns newest-per-id, id-sorted,
  corrupt-lines-skipped. `merge_into_rows(entry_dir, live_rows)` folds the log into an entity-dir
  export: a tombstone whose id is GONE from the live rows is appended (the delete marker is all
  that remains); a tombstone whose id is LIVE AGAIN (recreated after delete) is DROPPED, so a stale
  marker can't delete a resurrected entity. `prune(entry_dir, *, keep_after)` GCs entries past the
  sync horizon so the log can't grow unbounded. Wired into `export_shards`' entity-dir branch,
  guarded by `entry.tombstones` (so only tasks/projects pay for it) — a hard-deleted task's marker
  now rides the export as a tombstone row, which merge+writeback already honor (verified
  end-to-end). The `_`+`.jsonl` name keeps it invisible to BOTH the store's `*.json` reads and the
  exporter's entity extraction (proven). Clock-free at the seam (`now`/`keep_after` passed in).
  Determinism guarantee intact (33 shards tests + 20 db-shards/sync-cycle tests green). No user
  surface → no CHANGELOG. **Remaining (6c-iii-b):** call `record_tombstone` from the four hard-delete
  sites (`tasks/native.py:delete_task`/`delete_comment`, `hierarchy.delete_project`/
  `delete_task_list`) + invoke `prune` from the sync cycle with a horizon derived from
  `sync_stale_after_secs`. Then DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync transport apps in GideonApps +
  e2e criterion-4 over a real git repo/folder). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (710 files);
  `tests/test_durability_tombstones.py` (12: record/read/dedup/corrupt-skip/invisible-to-glob,
  fold appends-when-gone + drops-when-live + passthrough, prune horizon, end-to-end export fold)
  + shards/db-shards/sync-cycle regression (53) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-6c-iii-b (wire the delete sites + prune) + a scoping discovery

- **DAS-6c-iii-b DONE (the flat-entity delete sites + GC).** `tasks/native.py:delete_task` and
  `hierarchy.py:delete_task_list` now call `record_tombstone` after their hard `unlink`, keyed by
  the id the exporter emits for that file: a task's id is its stem (`<task_id>`), a task list's is
  its relpath-stem under the `tasks` entry dir (`task_lists/<id>`). Both are best-effort (a failed
  breadcrumb never fails the delete). `run_sync_job` calls a new `_prune_tombstones(home,
  stale_after_secs)` after a SUCCESSFUL cycle — horizon = now − window×4 (a generous "every peer
  has surely pulled by now" margin), walking every `tombstones=True` entity-dir entry. A
  hard-deleted task's marker now rides the export end-to-end (verified: create two tasks, delete
  one, export → the deleted id appears as a `deleted_at` row, the kept id as a live row).
- **DISCOVERY (scoping, recorded for 6c-iii-c).** Two of the four hard-delete sites are NOT clean
  flat-entity deletes, so they're deliberately deferred, not wired here:
  - **`delete_project` deletes a SUBTREE** (`projects/<id>/project.json` + `context/` + worktrees),
    and the exporter emits one row PER `*.json` file (id = relpath-stem), so a project is MANY
    shard rows. One tombstone id can't capture it — 6c-iii-c must enumerate the subtree's rows (or
    the merge/writeback need a prefix-tombstone concept). Deferred.
  - **`delete_comment` REWRITES a sidecar** (`_comments_<task_id>.json`) — it's an UPDATE to an
    existing entity file, not an entity unlink, so ordinary update-sync already carries it; no
    tombstone is needed (and the sidecar is itself an entity row the exporter picks up). Correctly
    out of scope.
  So delete-convergence now holds for **tasks and task lists** (the common case); **project**
  deletion convergence waits on 6c-iii-c. **Remaining:** 6c-iii-c (project-subtree tombstones),
  DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync transport apps in GideonApps + e2e criterion-4 over a real git
  repo/folder). **Gates:** `make lint` clean (710 files); `tests/test_durability_tombstone_wiring.py`
  (4: delete_task records a marker + it rides the export, delete_task_list records a relpath-keyed
  marker, prune trims old markers) + tasks/durability/hierarchy regression (646 passed, 2 skipped).

## Execution log — DAS-6c-iii-c (project-subtree delete tombstones) — DAS-6c-iii COMPLETE

- **DAS-6c-iii-c DONE; DAS-6c-iii COMPLETE.** A project is a SUBTREE
  (`projects/<id>/project.json` + `context/*.json`), and the `projects` entity-dir export emits
  one row per `*.json` with id = its path relative to the entry dir — so a single project-id
  tombstone couldn't cover it. `hierarchy.delete_project` now enumerates every synced `*.json` in
  the subtree BEFORE the `rmtree` and records a tombstone per relpath-stem
  (`<id>/project`, `<id>/context/<name>`, …), skipping `worktrees/` (it's `derived_within` on the
  inventory entry — never exported, so it must never be tombstoned either). The cascade that drops
  the project's task lists now also records THEIR tombstones (the cascade unlinks directly, so it
  needed the marker too). Verified end-to-end: delete a project → every synced row (project +
  context) rides the export as a `deleted_at` row while a kept project stays live; the default
  project still can't be deleted and leaves no marker. **DAS-6c-iii is now COMPLETE** —
  delete-convergence holds for ALL entity-dir entries: tasks, task lists (6c-iii-b), and projects
  incl. their context (6c-iii-c). (`delete_comment` needs no tombstone — it rewrites a sidecar,
  an update ordinary sync carries.) **Remaining in DAS-6:** only DAS-6d (git-sync + dir-sync
  installable `sync` transport apps in the sibling GideonApps repo + the end-to-end
  criterion-4 over a real git repo/folder — the last piece of Session 3). **Gates:** `make lint`
  clean (710 files); `tests/test_durability_project_tombstones.py` (3: every synced subtree row
  tombstoned + worktrees skipped, markers ride the export, default-project guarded) + hierarchy/
  tasks/tombstone regression (553 passed, 2 skipped).

## Execution log — DAS-6d-iii (two-machine convergence over a REAL transport) — DAS-6 COMPLETE

- **DAS-6d-iii DONE; DAS-6d COMPLETE; DAS-6 (whole DURABILITY-AND-SYNC Session-3 sync program)
  COMPLETE.** `tests/test_durability_convergence_e2e.py` proves the plan's **Success Criterion 4
  verbatim** over a REAL on-disk transport (`FolderTransport` — the dir-sync algorithm: insert-only
  atomic writes, prefix-filtered listing, rename-lock CAS on `registry.json`) driving core's real
  `run_sync_cycle` end to end: a task created on A **and a knowledge item added on B** (a
  `notifications.jsonl` append-stream event) both exist on both after one cycle each way; a task
  deleted on A (hard unlink + a `_tombstones.jsonl` marker, the DAS-6c-iii side-log) stays deleted
  on B; and the registry is real bytes on disk (`registry.json` with machine A recorded), not an
  in-memory dict. The earlier `test_durability_sync_cycle.py` proved convergence through an
  in-MEMORY fake; this closes the gap with a real filesystem transport. **Cross-repo ordering note
  (E5-avoided):** the git-sync/dir-sync transport APPS live in GideonApps (shipped as
  Apps#21/#22) and their CI installs core from `git+main`, but the durability engine
  (`sync_cycle`/`db_merge`/…) only exists on THIS stack until it merges — so a convergence test in
  the apps repo would fail apps-CI against main today. The real-transport convergence proof
  therefore lives HERE in core (where `run_sync_cycle` lives, hermetic, no cross-repo import); the
  transport apps carry their own per-transport tests (28 each) proving the same insert-only/CAS
  contract. **DAS-6 tally:** 6a contract, 6b import, 6c-i…6c-ii-j the sync engine (LIVE, config-gated
  service), 6c-iii-a/b/c delete-convergence, 6d-i dir-sync app (Apps#21), 6d-ii git-sync app
  (Apps#22), 6d-iii this convergence proof. The plan's five NEW-4 criteria + the amendment are met;
  the remaining plan sessions (S4 rsync/s3 + encryption, S5 time-travel + FE) are SEPARATE later
  atoms (DAS-7+/DAS-9), not part of the Session-3 sync program this completes. **Gates:** `make lint`
  clean (713 files); `tests/test_durability_convergence_e2e.py` (3: task-on-A + knowledge-on-B
  converge over a real folder, delete propagates, registry is real on-disk bytes) pass.

## Execution log — DAS-10 (§6 DSAR endpoints) — **PARTIAL**

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] **PARTIAL — the atom stays `todo`.** The §6 *endpoint* half landed complete;
  the *sync-config + conflict-review FE* half did not. Unmet clauses named at the bottom.

  **DONE.** (a) **`POST /api/durability/export {domains?}`** — full or per-domain
  (memory/knowledge/work/automation/platform/config/security, projected from the inventory so a new
  domain becomes exportable by declaration). (b) **`POST /api/durability/import`** — plan-first
  (`mode` omitted validates and writes nothing), `merge`/`replace`, MANIFEST v3 with v1|v2
  back-compat. (c) **`GET /api/durability/archive` + `POST /api/durability/archive/{id}/restore`** —
  per-domain row counts read from each archive's own manifest, plus the last drill's verdict.
  (d) Settings → **Backups gains the archive browser**; **Import/Export gains the three export
  buttons** (everything / knowledge / memory), §6's "separate buttons, not one blob".

  **CLEAN BREAK, not addition.** These four RETIRED `GET /api/durability/snapshots`,
  `POST /api/durability/restore` and the whole `/api/portability/*` trio (`handlers/portability.py`
  deleted; its multipart reader moved). Two export endpoints for one user story would have been two
  answers to one question. `/preview` folded into import's plan-first mode rather than being dropped.

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] 🔴 **MEASURED: the export leaked a `derived=True` store.** §6's rule is
  `secret ∪ derived` and only the `secret` half was enforced — `EXPORT_EXCLUDE` is a secret-projection
  (S1) and nothing projected `derived`, while `create_export_zip`'s database list named
  `memory_index.db` outright. Driven on a seeded home before writing any code: the zip contained
  `memory_index.db` **and its rows**. Now both halves project from the inventory, and the four write
  sites share ONE predicate (`_wanted`) — four independently-written filters is precisely how this
  survived four sessions. Proof is on the ARTIFACT: a planted `sk-ant-`-shaped key, a credential-store
  value and four derived payloads are asserted absent from the zip's **bytes**, not from an
  exclusion list (a list-reading test passed throughout the defect).

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] 🔴 **DISCOVERY, driven not reasoned: the "refuses while the gateway runs"
  guard on replace-restore was INERT on any non-default port.** A
  `mode=replace&confirm=true` request to a gateway on `--port 10188` returned **200 and performed the
  replace over the live home**, while serving that request. Cause: `snapshot._is_gateway_running()`
  probes `DASHBOARD_PORT` — the *configured* port — so it probed a socket nobody was listening on and
  answered "not running". The docstring (inherited from `api_durability_restore`, pre-existing since
  S184) claimed the opposite. **Fixed at the HTTP path definitively:** the handler refuses `replace`
  unconditionally, because serving the request IS proof the gateway is up — a socket probe is the
  wrong instrument from inside the process. The `pre-restore-<ts>/` escape hatch held in that
  unplanned incident and the displaced state was fully recoverable, which is the only reason this cost
  nothing. **Still open (NOT fixed here, out of scope):** the CLI's `_is_gateway_running()` has the
  same port bug, so `gideon restore --replace` can proceed while a non-default-port gateway
  runs. Lower severity (local terminal, `--force` already exists) but real.

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] DEVIATION: **§6's "shard export as a zip" is NOT what shipped.** §6 and the
  atom row both say the export is a *shard* zip with the §2 manifest inside. Measured why that cannot
  yet carry what §6 promises: `shards._export_blobs` writes `KIND_TREE` payloads to a
  content-addressed blob dir with **no path→hash index**, and **nothing anywhere rehydrates `blobs/`**
  (`writeback.apply_rows` raises for `KIND_TREE`; zero other readers). So a shard zip of
  `workspace/knowledge/files` — the user's documents, the entry §6 calls "the whole point" — would be
  a bag of anonymous blobs, unrestorable by name. Adding a tree index is a §2 shard-FORMAT change
  (DAS-2's contract, with byte-determinism tests on it), not this atom's. **What shipped instead:**
  the file-tree zip (which restores losslessly, filenames intact) carrying §2's *integrity* shape in
  MANIFEST v3 — `schema_version`, `machine_id`, and per-member `bytes`+`sha256`. That buys the real
  value: `validate_import_zip` now DETECTS a corrupted or tampered archive before an import writes
  anything (v1/v2 carried no hashes, so a truncated archive imported as far as it went). A v3 zip
  reports `verified: true`; v1/v2 report `verified: false` rather than implying a check happened.
  Owner call needed if the literal shard-zip form is still wanted — it needs the tree index first.

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] Two smaller findings, both caught by driving rather than reading.
  (1) **Per-domain scoping needs LONGEST-declared-match, not ancestor-wins.**
  `workspace/knowledge/files` (knowledge) is nested inside the `workspace` tree entry (platform); an
  ancestor-wins rule produced an **empty knowledge export** while filing every user document under
  platform — criterion 9's boundary, inverted. `portability.domain_of` is now the single rule, shared
  with the snapshot manifest's counts so the two cannot disagree. (2) **Counting rows on a staged
  database put WAL sidecars INTO the snapshot.** Opening a WAL-mode DB `mode=ro` makes SQLite create
  its `-shm`/`-wal`, and the count runs against the staged tree just before it is tarred —
  `test_wal_sidecars_never_ride_along` caught it. `immutable=1` is correct there and only there
  (the staged copy came through the backup API, so it is fully checkpointed).

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] A guard that NAMES what it guards falsifies the ratchet watching it.
  `test_the_snapshot_coverage_gap_list_can_only_shrink` decides snapshot coverage partly by grepping
  `portability.py` for entry paths. My first fail-closed exclusion fallback hard-coded three derived
  paths as literals, which made two genuinely-uncovered entries (`memory_faiss`, `memory_ids`) read as
  **covered** — a false negative in a coverage ratchet. Fixed by removing every path literal:
  `_excluded_entry_paths` now RAISES if the inventory is unavailable. That is also the right failure
  mode on its own terms — every other inventory lookup in that module degrades to literals because
  they decide what an export *includes* (a degraded answer costs completeness), while this one decides
  what it must NOT include (a degraded answer costs a leak).

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] Import failure semantics, now STATED in code rather than incidental. Neither
  mode is transactional (POSIX has no atomic multi-file swap), so the contract is *recoverability*:
  `merge` is copy-if-missing on every path, so a partial merge is a strict SUBSET of a complete one
  and re-running is idempotent — there is no hybrid to be left in; `replace` moves each live path into
  `pre-restore-<ts>/` **before** writing the incoming one, and the summary reports that directory even
  when the replace RAISED. Both are tested on the unhappy path (a `_do_replace` that runs and then
  fails leaves `pre-restore-*/config.json` byte-identical). Also added, per the amendment's
  belt-and-suspenders rule: a hand-built archive carrying `.env`/`credentials/`/a derived index has
  those paths stripped from the STAGED tree before anything reads it, so no per-branch skip can be
  forgotten — the shape the fourth hand-written list kept re-introducing.

- [2026-08-16][DAS-10] Security-control decisions, taken restrictively because §6 is silent on them
  (stated rather than assumed): all four routes **refuse an app-scoped token** (403 `owner_only`,
  matching `apps.api_app_token`'s `request["app"]` precedent) — an export hands the caller everything
  the system knows about the user, which is never an installed app's business; and **every writing
  verb needs `confirm: true`** on top of an explicit `mode`, with `mode` omitted returning the plan.
  The app-refusal test carries a vacuity floor (an owner request must still get its zip), without
  which a route that 403'd *everyone* would pass every refusal test.

  **Gates:** `make lint` clean (black/isort/flake8/mypy, 886 source files, 1721 formatted); `make
  test` exit 0; targeted 379 pass (`test_portability_dsar` 31 + `test_durability_dsar_routes` 18 +
  `test_durability_archive` 11 + portability/inventory/service/snapshot/security/agent-reference);
  web `npm run typecheck` + `npm test` (314 files, 3243 tests) + `npm run build` green.
  **Falsifications (3, each restored):** dropping the `derived` half of the exclusion set reds
  `test_v3_manifest_carries_the_integrity_shape` — and, notably, NOT the byte-leak test, because the
  db projection independently excludes derived; breaking BOTH enforcers reds
  `AssertionError: derived database row leaked into the export`. Removing `1` from
  `SUPPORTED_MANIFEST_VERSIONS` reds `AssertionError: Unsupported manifest version: 1` against a
  hand-built v1 fixture (not a v3 with an edited version field). Making `_backup_and_copy` delete
  instead of move reds `AssertionError: a failed replace must leave the displaced originals on disk`.
  **Drove as a user** on an isolated `demo-home` at :10188: three exports inspected by hand (198
  members full, 1 each for knowledge/memory), planted `sk-ant-` key and credential-store value both
  absent, zero derived entries; snapshot + drill run, archive browser rendering real per-domain row
  counts (`memory: 10 rows, security: 34 rows, work: 17 rows`) and the drill verdict; export → SECOND
  fresh home → import restored **197 of 197 members, 0 missing**, memory.db 10 rows, knowledge.db
  3 rows, and no `.env` arrived. Both panels screenshotted, no console errors.

  **UNMET — why this stays `todo`:** (1) "sync config via the standard `/api/providers` routes" — no
  FE built; `SyncTypeHandler` is registered (DAS-6) but nothing was driven through the provider
  settings surface. (2) "the conflict review queue" — `durability/conflicts.py` has NO HTTP route and
  no screen, so DAS-7's queue is still unreadable by a user; criterion 9's *second* half (memory and
  knowledge conflicts on SEPARATE review surfaces) is therefore unmet — only its export half landed.
  (3) Criterion 10 (a third-party `type:"sync"` app registers/configures/syncs with zero core changes)
  was not verified end to end. Those three are one coherent follow-up scope and want their own atom.

## Execution log — DAS-10b (§4.2 conflict review queue + §4.3 sync config FE) — closes DAS-10

- [2026-08-17][DAS-10b] **DONE — the three clauses DAS-10 recorded as UNMET.** (1) **The conflict
  review queue got a route and a screen.** `durability/conflicts.py` was 321 lines with zero HTTP
  reachability: `GET /api/durability/conflicts` (records + counts + whether a transport is even
  configured) and `POST /api/durability/conflicts/{id}/resolve {choice, confirm}` now exist, wired in
  `server.py`, with a `Conflicts to review` section in Settings → Backups. (2) **Sync configuration**
  — a `Sync` section for the four `durability.sync_*` fields (enable, transport chooser over the
  installed `type: "sync"` providers, staleness window, encryption) plus `sync` in `ProvidersPanel`'s
  `ENTITY_META`, which previously rendered a real entity through the unknown-type fallback ("sync
  providers", wrench icon). Each transport's OWN settings stay on its provider card — the standard
  `/api/providers/{name}/schema` + `/config` routes — because that is the seam criterion 10 names.
  (3) **Criterion 10 verified end to end**, not argued: `test_durability_sync_app_criterion10.py`
  writes a third-party `acme-box-sync` app (an `app.json` + a `provider.py` importing core only via
  `sdk.sync`) into a temp home, registers + enables it through the real provider registry, drives its
  schema/config through the generic `/api/providers` routes, then runs `service.run_sync_job()` and
  asserts shards landed in the folder the app owns, carry this machine's task row, and contain none of
  the four secret markers. A final test greps `src/gideon` for the app name to keep "zero core
  changes" a measured property.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-10b] 🔴 **WRITER CENSUS, and the correction it forced.** The brief expected
  `detect_conflicts`/`ConflictQueue` to have no production writer. They do:
  `service.run_sync_job` → `sync_cycle.run_sync_cycle` (:104 builds the queue) → `pull_engine` →
  `reconcile.reconcile_entry` (:199 detects, records, holds) and `service.py:419` drafts proposals
  after a cycle with conflicts. So the queue is **genuinely fed** — its precondition is a configured
  transport, which is exactly what clause (1) above had no UI for. The two halves were one gap.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-10b] 🔴 **MEASURED: criterion 9's "separate review surfaces" cannot be exercised
  today, and that is a fact about the inventory, not about this atom.** `detect_conflicts` fires only
  for `merge ∈ {union_by_id, lww}` on a kind `reconcile` handles, and **no memory- or
  knowledge-domain entry is both**: the memory/knowledge/lexicon/learning stores are `sqlite`
  (ATTACH-OR-IGNORE has no conflict concept), `memory_ids` is `replace_only`, and
  `knowledge_files`/`learning_proposals` are `tree` kinds reconcile declines. So building a memory
  screen and a knowledge screen would be enforcing a control over a population of zero. Instead the
  routing is kept correct and made OBSERVABLE: the list returns `counts.by_surface` for every
  surface, the panel says "N memory conflicts are waiting on their own review surface" rather than
  implying none exist, and `test_no_memory_or_knowledge_entry_can_currently_conflict` fails the day
  an entry changes — at which point the two screens become real, declared work.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-10b] **Failure semantics for the resolve, stated rather than implied:
  RECOVERABLE, not transactional** — matching the §6 half's choice. Order: the store write first (a
  WHOLE-ENTRY rewrite through `writeback.apply_rows` with the reviewed row substituted by id), then
  the queue flip to `resolved`. A failed write leaves the record `needs-review` and the store
  untouched; a landed write whose queue update fails ALSO reports a refusal, and re-resolving writes
  identical bytes, so the recoverable direction is "ask again", never "half-applied and reported
  done". The whole-entry rewrite is load-bearing, not an optimisation: `apply_rows` writes the SET it
  is handed, so a single-row apply would truncate a `jsonl_append` stream to one event —
  `test_resolving_one_row_does_not_truncate_the_store` pins it. Refusals are typed
  (`unknown_choice`/`not_found`/`already_resolved`/`unknown_entry`/`unsupported_kind`/`no_version`/
  `write_failed`), and `accept_proposal` REFUSES when the LLM draft failed rather than falling back
  to a version the user did not ask for. Both routes are `owner_only` (403 on an app token) and the
  resolve requires `confirm: true` for **every** choice including `keep_local` — same "one signal to
  look, two to write" contract as §6.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-10b] **Gates:** `make lint` clean (black/isort/flake8 + mypy, 904 source files,
  1759 formatted); targeted pytest 285 pass (`test_durability_conflict_review` 16 new +

  11 pass; web `npm run typecheck` + full `npm test` (366 files, 3711 tests) + `npm run build` green.
  Reference docs regenerated for the two new routes. **Falsifications (4, each restored from a file
  copy):** forcing the list handler to return `[]` reds
  `AssertionError: assert '79246c3c351c83b0' in []`; emptying the panel's `pending` list reds six FE
  tests with `Unable to find an element with the text: task-42`; swallowing the queue rejection into
  an empty answer reds `Unable to find an element with the text: /could not be read/i`; neutering the
  confirm gate reds `assert 200 == 409` here AND `assert 404 == 409` in the §6 half's restore test.
  **Drove as a user** on an isolated `.dev-home` at :10461 (real-home file count in the last two
  hours afterwards: **0**): a conflict seeded through the real detector listed over HTTP through the
  registered route; unconfirmed resolve → 409 `confirm_required` with the store byte-unchanged;
  `accept_proposal` on an undrafted record → 409 `no_version`; confirmed `take_remote` → 200, the
  peer's title written, **the sibling task file untouched**; a repeat → 409 `already_resolved`. The
  browser could not be driven (the devtools profile was held by a parallel session), so the panel
  itself is covered by 12 RTL tests against the real component plus a check that the built bundle
  carries the new copy.

## Execution log — DAS-8 (§4.4 encryption + the SYNC egress profile) — **PARTIAL**

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] **PARTIAL — the atom stays `todo`.** The §4.4 *encryption* half and the
  §4.3 *SYNC egress derivation* landed complete and LIVE; the two **transport apps did not**.
  Unmet clauses named at the bottom.

  **DONE.** (a) **`net/policy.py` gains the `SYNC` profile + `sync_egress_policy(endpoint)`** —
  derived through `egress_policy_for()` exactly as the Plug-in Map requires. The base is
  `allow_only=True` with an **empty** host list, so an *unpinned* SYNC policy reaches **nothing**:
  a transport that forgets to pin cannot silently inherit STRICT's whole-public-internet reach,
  which is what a base of `STRICT + raised caps` would have given it. `max_bytes` is **raised to
  200 MB, not removed** (a whole-DB shard is big; an unbounded body is still a DoS). The pin is
  applied **after** the operator layering, because `egress_policy_for` UNIONs the operator's
  `allow_hosts` into any base — for an exclusive policy that would have made every host the
  operator listed for *other* surfaces a valid S3 endpoint. (b) **`durability/crypto.py`** — the
  AES-256-GCM codec at the transport boundary: Argon2id-stretch → HKDF-Expand per object,
  12 random bytes of nonce per encryption, header + **object key** as AAD, first-write-wins salt
  object, both-direction plaintext rejection, `sync_encrypt` tri-state with per-transport
  defaults. (c) **Wired LIVE** into `push_engine.publish_export` / `pull_engine._pull_one_seq` /
  `run_sync_cycle` / `service.run_sync_job` — not a module waiting for a caller. (d)
  **`sdk/sync.py` + `sdk/net.py`** re-export the egress derivation and the routing-key/credential-
  name constants a transport app needs; the encrypt/decrypt primitives are deliberately **NOT**
  exported (a transport that could encrypt for itself is one that could forget to).

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] 🔴 **MEASURED DATA-LOSS DEFECT, found by driving it, now fixed.** The first
  implementation treated every decrypt failure as §4.4's "permanent skip" and advanced the cursor.
  Driven on a real folder remote: a machine that ran **one** cycle with a mistyped passphrase
  permanently skipped **every** peer seq — cursor advanced past `LAPTOP seq 1`, 44 objects
  discarded — and storing the *correct* passphrase afterwards did **not** re-pull them. The row
  was gone for good. §4.4's permanent-skip clause is about **plaintext**, which can never become
  readable; a failed GCM tag is "wrong key OR tampering" and the user can fix the first. `SkipReport`
  now has two buckets: `keys` (plaintext / unsupported version → `payload-bad`, cursor **advances**,
  no loop) and `unreadable` (failed tag → `prerequisite-absent`, cursor **holds**). Re-driven: the
  typo cycle holds 3 seqs and advances 0, then the corrected cycle merges **268 rows** and recovers
  the exact row. A hold costs a re-pull; the advance cost the user their data.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] 🔴 **DISCOVERY: a pinned PRIVATE endpoint is reachable with no operator
  opt-in** — my own module comment claimed the opposite until I drove it. `allow_hosts` waives the
  private-range block for a listed host (documented `EgressPolicy` semantics), and the pinned
  endpoint *is* the one listed host, so `http://127.0.0.1:9000` and `http://nas.local:9000` are
  reachable while `allow_private` is still `False`. That is the right posture for §4.4 (user-owned
  storage; a self-hosted MinIO/NAS is a first-class target; the endpoint comes from operator
  provider settings, never from anything an agent influences) — so the *comment* was fixed, not the
  behaviour, and a test now pins the posture so it is a decision on record instead of a surprise.
  The one private address where "reach whatever the operator configured" becomes credential theft
  IS closed: `SYNC_DENY_HOSTS` denies the cloud metadata services, a deny outranks the allow-list
  and precedes DNS, and `sync_egress_policy` refuses outright when the endpoint names a denied host.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] **DEVIATION (a strengthening, recorded not smuggled): Argon2id before HKDF.**
  §4.4 says "per-shard key via HKDF from a user passphrase". HKDF is a *fast* KDF, so a passphrase
  fed to it directly is an offline-brute-force gift to whoever holds the bucket — precisely the
  adversary this feature exists for. The key schedule is therefore Argon2id (same RFC 9106 profile
  `auth/credentials.py` uses, paid once per process) → HKDF-Expand per object with `info` = the
  object key. Same inputs the plan names (passphrase + first-write-wins salt), same machine-agnostic
  property, no new dependency (`cryptography` and `argon2-cffi` are both already core). Binding the
  object key into the AAD is the second addition: an attacker with bucket write access cannot replay
  machine A's `tasks` shard as machine B's, or an old seq's as a new one.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] ⚠️ **OWNER DECISION WANTED — the one under-specified security default.**
  §4.4 enumerates a CLOSED set of per-transport defaults (ON for `s3-sync`/`dir-sync`, OFF for
  `git-sync`) and is silent on two cases. I shipped: **`rsync-sync` → ON** (the plan's two stated
  criteria don't decide it — an ssh target *is* user-controlled, but an rsync'd shard tree was
  never diffable — so the tie went to the secure default), and **an UNNAMED third-party transport
  → OFF**. The second is the uncomfortable one and I want it reviewed. ON is safer in the abstract
  but measurably worse here: it turns installing any third-party `type:"sync"` app into a hard sync
  stop until a passphrase is stored, which breaks **criterion 10**'s "registers, configures, and
  *syncs* with zero core changes" — this atom would have silently disabled a shipped capability.
  OFF is non-regressive (nothing was encrypted before) and the safe posture is one PATCH away.
  What keeps OFF honest rather than quiet: `encryption_enabled_for` logs the resolution once per
  transport naming the transport and the verdict, and `status()["sync"]["encrypted"]` reports the
  **resolved** boolean rather than echoing `"auto"`.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] **Key custody, rotation, loss — stated because the plan is thin here.**
  Passphrase: credential store only, under `GIDEON_SYNC_PASSPHRASE`; never `config.json`,
  never `app.json`, never a provider-settings field, so it is in no API response, no config export
  and no time-travel git history. Derived keys: in-memory for the life of a cycle, never persisted;
  `SyncCodec.__repr__` withholds the key so a traceback cannot leak it. Loss: the local home stays
  authoritative and untouched, so a forgotten passphrase costs the ability to read the *remote*
  copies, not the user's data — recovery is a fresh sync root. **Rotation is NOT built**: it would
  mean re-encrypting every historical object under a new salt, which is a plan-level decision, so
  it is named here rather than improvised.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] **Proofs are on artifacts, not on calls.** 105 tests. Ciphertext: the planted
  row's bytes are asserted **absent** from the encrypted object (and no 8/16/24-byte prefix of it
  survives); a wrong key, a wrong salt, a flipped byte at six offsets, a truncation, a version
  downgrade and a **relocated** ciphertext each REFUSE rather than return garbage. Nonces: 500
  shards → 500 distinct nonces, and identical bytes encrypted twice differ. Egress: the derived
  policy is driven through the **real guard**, which refuses `evil.example.com`,
  `s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` and the metadata IP under a policy pinned to one endpoint.
  Credentials: a canary passphrase is planted and asserted absent from the exception text, `repr`,
  `str`, every skip reason, the ciphertext and every captured log record — as is the derived key's
  hex. Criterion 7 is asserted on the **pushed bytes** with a planted `sk-ant-`-shaped token in
  every declared secret path, parametrized over encryption ON and OFF. Criterion 8 runs end to end
  over a real on-disk transport. **Falsifications (4, each restored from a file copy):** skipping
  encryption for one shard → *"machines/A/seq-0001/tasks/entities.jsonl landed on the remote as
  plaintext"* (and, before I also blinded the send-side re-check, the guard caught it first and the
  vacuity floor fired — the re-check is not decorative); a fixed nonce → *"nonce reuse: only 1
  distinct nonces over 500 objects"*; `allow_only=False` → *"https://evil.example.com/bucket/obj was
  reachable under a host-pinned SYNC policy"*; reading the passphrase from config → *"assert '' ==
  'CANARY-PASSP...ot-log-2f7a1c'"*.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] **As-a-user validation (port 10377, `GIDEON_HOME=/private/tmp/das8-home`;
  real home verified untouched — no `sync/`, no planted task).** `PATCH
  /api/config/gideon {path: "durability.sync_encrypt"}` round-trips to `config.json` and
  `GET /api/durability/status` reports `encrypt` + the **resolved** `encrypted`; `"maybe"` is
  refused with *"invalid value, must be one of ('auto', 'on', 'off')"*. The full 5×3
  transport×setting matrix was driven through HTTP and matches the shipped table, and the
  third-party `auto`→OFF resolution appeared in `gateway.log` as designed. A real encrypted cycle
  against a local folder sink published **168 shard objects, 168 ciphertext / 0 plaintext**; the
  planted row (`alice@example.com`, `142000`, `payroll`, `salary review`) is absent from **every
  byte** in the sink, while `registry.json`, the salt and the machine/seq key paths stay readable
  with **no key**; no secret marker appears anywhere. A second home with the right passphrase
  recovered the row verbatim, one with the wrong passphrase merged **0 rows**.
  **No real remote was exercised** — there is no S3 bucket and no ssh host here. The S3-shaped wire
  path was driven against a local HTTP stub: PUT/LIST/GET through `net.fetch` under the derived
  policy (never hand-rolled aiohttp), byte-identical round trip, ciphertext at rest in the stub, and
  the same policy refusing `127.0.0.2`, `s3.amazonaws.com` and the metadata IP.

- [2026-08-17][DAS-8] **UNMET — why the atom stays `todo`.** (1) **`rsync-sync` and `s3-sync` are
  not shipped as first-party apps.** First-party apps live in the **sibling `GideonApps`
  repo** (`apps/catalog.py::_first_party_source` resolves `<workspace>/apps`, never a path inside
  core), exactly as `dir-sync` (Apps#21) and `git-sync` (Apps#22) did for DAS-6d — and this session
  was scoped to the core worktree. The same cross-repo ordering DAS-6d-iii recorded applies: apps-CI
  installs core from `git+main`, so an app built against `sync_egress_policy` / the codec cannot go
  green until this lands. Core's half is deliberately the contract-owner half, so the two apps are
  now buildable with **zero further core changes**: `sdk.sync` hands them the pinned policy, the
  routing-key set and the credential name, and encryption is applied **above** them by the cycle.
  (2) The done_when's "signed PUT/GET/LIST" — SigV4 request signing — is app work and is not here;
  what core proves is the policy + `net.fetch` path those requests must travel. (3) **Criterion 8 is
  met** over a real on-disk transport; its literal "encrypted **S3** sync store" wording is only
  provable once `s3-sync` exists. Criterion 7 is met and adversarially verified. Follow-up atom:
  the two transport apps in `GideonApps`, which is a genuinely separable, dependency-complete
  scope now that this merged.

  matcher.

  = 3` is **written**, not merely accepted (`portability.py:122`), with `SUPPORTED_MANIFEST_VERSIONS =
  (1, 2, 3)` (`:126`). Archive rows carry per-domain counts and the last drill's verdict
  (`handlers/durability.py:158-165`). The separate memory/knowledge export buttons are

  wrong copy won.** `create_export_zip` has four write sites; the `workspace`/`skills`/`cron-history`
  tree walk (`portability.py:505-523`) wrote **every** file it found, including the sqlite stores the
  database projection above it had already written through `_backup_sqlite`. The inventory sweep
  further down refuses raw database copies for exactly this reason (`:571`, "measured UNUSABLE — no
  such table") — that rule was never applied to the older hand-written walk. Two of the inventory's
  declared stores sit inside that tree (`workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`,
  `workspace/lexicon/lexicon.db`), so on any real home both were duplicated. **Measured** on a home
  whose `workspace/lexicon/lexicon.db` held 500 rows behind a 53 KB uncheckpointed WAL: the zip held
  the path twice (**6 entries against 5 declared members**, plus zipfile's `Duplicate name` warning),
  shipped `lexicon.db-wal` **and** `lexicon.db-shm`, and — the real defect — when `_backup_sqlite`
  raised, the projection logged "skipping unreadable database" while the walk shipped a raw 45 KB copy
  anyway **and the manifest declared it**, so the artifact presented a member the export had decided
  not to carry. The later entry wins on extraction, so the checkpointed copy was silently replaced.
  Fixed with `_is_projected_db` consulted by the walk. Deliberately **narrower** than the inventory
  sweep's blanket `.db` skip: `workspace/` is the user's own directory, so dropping an *undeclared*
  sqlite file a user put there would trade one data defect for another — pinned by
  `test_an_undeclared_database_in_the_users_workspace_still_travels`.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-10c] **Why the shipped suite could not see it.** `test_portability_dsar.py`'s
  `seeded_home` plants its databases at the TOP of the home, where only one write site can reach
  them, and `_zip_of` returns a `sorted(set(...))`-shaped name list — a path written twice reads as
  written once. Both were the reason a duplicate survived. The new fixture seeds a declared store
  *inside* the `workspace` tree with a real WAL, and `_entries` preserves duplicates.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-10c] 🔴 **The `secret ∪ derived` boundary has THREE independent layers, and the
  count is not symmetric.** Established by mutation, not by reading: (a) emptying
  `_is_excluded`'s `EXPORT_EXCLUDE` name check leaked nothing; (b) `return False` from the whole
  `secret ∪ derived` chain check (`:186`) leaked nothing; (c) widening
  `inventory.export_entries()` to `tuple(INVENTORY)` leaked nothing. Only (b) **and** (c) together
  leaked, and even then **only the derived canaries** — `memory_index.db`,
  `memory.faiss/index.bin`, `models/weights.bin`, `session_search.db` all entered the zip while the
  three SECRET canaries stayed out, because `is_sensitive_path()` at each write site is a third guard
  that covers secrets and does **not** cover derived state. So: secret exclusion survives any two
  layers failing; derived exclusion rests on exactly two. Recorded because the asymmetry is invisible
  in the code and a future refactor could remove the second derived layer believing a third exists.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-10c] **Independent artifact proof (not a test's claim).** A real export was built
  from a home seeded with four secret canaries plus a derived-index canary, and **every member's raw
  bytes** were scanned: 9 zip entries / 8 declared members / 4 domains
  (`config`, `platform`, `knowledge`, `memory`), 17 excluded entries named in the manifest, `files/`
  originals present (`my-notes.md`, `receipt.pdf` — criterion 9's knowledge half), and zero canaries
  anywhere. Export → import into a SECOND fresh home restored the user stores with `.env`,
  `credentials/store.json` and `memory_index.db` all absent. Both runs pinned
  `GIDEON_HOME` **and** `GIDEON_WORKSPACE`; the real `~/.gideon` was verified
  untouched against a mid-session reference file (`find -newer`, with a vacuity check proving the
  guard matches when it should — `-newermt '-45 minutes'` is vacuous on this box).

- [2026-08-18][DAS-10c] **Falsifications** (mutate the live line, `py_compile` the mutant, quote the
  red, restore from a file copy): (1) guard disabled → all three new rails red
  (`written more than once: ['workspace/lexicon/lexicon.db']`, `sqlite sidecars travelled: [...-wal,
  ...-shm]`, `a skipped database still travelled`) while the undeclared-database rail correctly stayed
  green; (2) `SUPPORTED_MANIFEST_VERSIONS = (3,)` → `Unsupported manifest version: 1` and `: 2`, so
  the v1|v2 back-compat path is genuinely gated; (3) the three-layer exclusion mutations above.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-10c] **Gates:** `make lint` **exit 0** (black 1789 files, isort, flake8, mypy
  "no issues found in 919 source files") · `test_portability_dsar` + `test_portability` +
  `test_durability_dsar_routes` + `test_durability_sync_app_criterion10` + `test_durability_archive` +
  `test_durability_conflict_review` + `test_durability_inventory` + `test_durability_shards` +
  `test_config_roundtrip` = **215 passed**. No `web/` change, so the npm gate was not required.
  No config field added, so the round-trip contract does not apply.
## Execution log — DAS-8b (the two transport apps; closes DAS-8's UNMET item 1) — **PARTIAL**

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **The apps half of DAS-8, in `GideonApps`.** DAS-8's own log
  (2026-08-17) landed the §4.4 encryption + §4.3 SYNC-egress half in core and named the
  follow-up exactly: *"the two transport apps in `GideonApps`, which is a genuinely
  separable, dependency-complete scope now that this merged."* This is that scope. **Both**
  `s3-sync` and `rsync-sync` shipped, 137 tests, and it needed **zero core code changes** —
  the prior session's claim that the two apps were buildable against `sdk.sync` alone held
  exactly. The only core edit here is one user-facing help string (`sync_transport` named
  two transports; there are now four).

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **`s3-sync`** — SigV4-signed PUT/GET/LIST through `sdk.net.fetch`
  under `sync_egress_policy(endpoint)`, no `boto3`/`botocore`/`aiohttp` dependency (signing
  is ~60 lines of `hmac`/`hashlib`, asserted at the AST level so a second unguarded code
  path cannot appear). **The signature is verified against botocore, not merely pinned:**
  five request shapes (PUT with `If-None-Match`, prefixed LIST with a query, GET, a key
  needing percent-encoding, a `host:port` MinIO endpoint) match `botocore.auth.SigV4Auth`
  byte-for-byte at a pinned clock, and three of those are committed as goldens asserted
  **unconditionally**, so a signing regression cannot hide behind an environment with no
  botocore. Two design consequences that are forced, not chosen: **path-style addressing is
  mandatory** (virtual-host style puts the bucket in the *hostname*, which is not the host
  the policy pinned, so every request would be refused by the guard), and **a truncated body
  is an integrity failure** — `fetch` caps at `policy.max_bytes` and *reports* the cap rather
  than raising, so `pull` drops a truncated object instead of handing a prefix of a shard to
  the merge. Insert-only is `If-None-Match: *` on the PUT itself: one round trip, and no
  HEAD-then-PUT race.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] 🔴 **MEASURED DEFECT in `s3-sync`, found by driving the real fetch
  path, now fixed.** `aiohttp` normalises the response header to `Etag`; the S3 API documents
  `ETag`. The case-SENSITIVE lookup returned `""` for every ETag, so `cas_registry` hit its
  "no ETag means we cannot make the write conditional" guard and returned **False on every
  swap, forever** — a machine could register itself once and then never update the registry
  again. Invisible to a mocked transport: it only appears when a real HTTP client hands back
  the headers. Fixed with a case-insensitive `_header()` helper and pinned by a regression
  test that asserts the *casing* (`"ETag" not in resp.headers`) rather than just the outcome.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] 🔴 **MEASURED DEFECT in `rsync-sync`, found before writing the code.**
  rsync's quick check compares **size + mtime**, so a rewrite that keeps the same byte length
  within the same clock second is **not transferred at all — and rsync exits 0**, so the write
  looks successful. Reproduced with the realistic registry shape: `{"seq":19}` →
  `{"seq":20}` (same length) left the target holding `{"seq":19}`. Shard objects are immune
  (insert-only, never rewritten) but `registry.json` is rewritten every cycle, so registry
  writes use `--ignore-times` and are then **read back and verified**. Also measured: macOS
  ships **openrsync** ("rsync version 2.6.9 compatible"), not GNU rsync 3.x, so the flag set
  is deliberately conservative (`-rt`, `-i`, `--ignore-existing`, `--ignore-times`,
  `--list-only`, `-e`) — all verified against the real binary rather than assumed.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **DEVIATION (recorded, not smuggled): `rsync-sync` has no CAS, so its
  registry swap is verify → write → read-back-verify.** rsync has a create-only primitive
  (`--ignore-existing`, whose `--itemize-changes` output reports whether the file was really
  created, which is a *real* answer to the `expected_sha is None` case) but nothing
  conditional for an overwrite. The bias is chosen from core's own retry loop
  (`push_engine._commit_registry`): a **False re-pulls, re-merges peers' entries and retries**,
  so a false False costs one round trip, while a false True silently discards another
  machine's registration. So the transport reports failure whenever it cannot prove its own
  bytes landed. A residual race remains — two machines swapping in the same instant can lose
  one update, which the loser re-applies next cycle — and it is documented in the app's README
  with the pointer that `s3-sync` has genuinely conditional writes. This is the same class of
  degradation `dir-sync` already ships (rename-lock), not a new one.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] ⚠️ **SECURITY DECISION: `s3-sync` does NOT read the ambient AWS
  credential chain.** The env fallbacks are `GIDEON_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
  `GIDEON_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `GIDEON_S3_SESSION_TOKEN` — deliberately not
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, not `AWS_PROFILE`, and no instance-role/IMDS chain. A personal sync
  transport that silently adopted whatever AWS identity happened to be in the operator's
  shell could write the user's assistant state into a company or production account nobody
  intended; the `SYNC_DENY_HOSTS` metadata denial closes the same hole from the other side.
  Pinned by a test that exports four `AWS_*` vars and asserts the provider stays unconfigured.
  The README states it as a feature, so it reads as a decision rather than an omission.
  `rsync-sync` likewise never disables host-key checking: no `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, no
  `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` (both asserted absent), only `BatchMode=yes` so a key prompt
  fails fast instead of hanging a background job.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **Criterion 7 re-proved against BOTH new transports.** Its wording is
  "adversarially verified against **every** transport", and core proves it against a
  test-local folder transport — so two new transports need the proof re-run. A canary
  (`sk-ant-CANARY-<path>`) is planted in **every** path `inventory.secret_paths()` declares,
  a real `run_sync_cycle` is driven, and the scan runs on **the bytes that actually left** —
  the captured HTTP request bodies for `s3-sync`, the files on the target for `rsync-sync` —
  parametrized over encryption ON and OFF (the exclusion must not depend on encryption).
  Object KEYS are scanned too, since metadata stays plaintext. Each scan carries a vacuity
  floor (non-empty wire, ≥1 `machines/` shard) **plus** a companion test that plants the
  canary somewhere that legitimately syncs and asserts the scan **finds** it — a canary scan
  that cannot fail is not a proof.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **Criterion 8 now provable as literally worded.** DAS-8 recorded it as
  met over an on-disk transport with the caveat that *"its literal 'encrypted **S3** sync
  store' wording is only provable once `s3-sync` exists."* It exists: over the real signed
  wire, every shard body is `is_ciphertext`, the planted row (`alice@example.com`, `payroll`,
  `salary-review`) is absent from every byte pushed, while a **second provider holding no
  passphrase at all** still lists the remote, reads `registry.json` as JSON, and sees the
  first-write-wins salt object — and a plaintext object planted into the encrypted store is
  skipped without being merged and without being re-reported on the next cycle.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **Falsifications — 19 mutations, each restored from a file copy, never
  `git checkout`.** Reds quoted: insert-only removed → *"insert-only was violated"*; truncation
  accepted → *"a truncated shard was returned as if it were data"*; query `/` left raw →
  golden signature mismatch; ambient AWS borrowed → *"assert 'AKIA-AMBIENT-PRODUCTION' == ''"*;
  ETag read case-sensitively → the original defect reproduces; CAS retried unconditionally
  after a 501 → *"assert True is False"*; `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` added → *"would open a
  man-in-the-middle"*; timeout removed → *"an unbounded command could wedge the sync job"*;
  host/path validation disabled → *"DID NOT RAISE RsyncConfigError"*; directories counted as
  objects → extra `machines/` entries; mirror traversal guard removed →
  *"['../../outside.txt', 'a'] == ['a']"*; read-back verify removed → *"assert True is False"*.
  **THREE mutations came back GREEN and each exposed a real hole in my own rails, now closed:**
  (1) widening the provider's egress to `allow_only=False` left the whole egress class green,
  because every assertion was made against `sync_egress_policy` rather than against what the
  transport actually handed `fetch` — a mechanism test, not a use test; a spy on `fetch` now
  asserts `allow_only`, the exact `allow_hosts` pin and the surviving deny list. (2) The
  missing-ETag guard was **unreachable** in the suite (the stub always sent one), so deleting
  it stayed green; the test now asserts the DECISION — that no PUT is even attempted — instead
  of the final bytes, which the stub's own 412 had been standing in for. (3) The
  `--ignore-times` rail was **timing-dependent**: it only reproduced when the two staging
  writes happened to land in different integer seconds, so removing the flag stayed green;
  both mtimes are now forced equal, making the quick-check condition hold every run.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **UNMET — why DAS-8 does not close here.** (1) **No live remote was
  exercised, by policy, not by omission.** Every AWS profile on this machine is
  Amazon-internal production, and Amazon production-safety forbids creating or writing any
  resource in an account that cannot be positively identified as non-production — so no
  bucket was touched. `s3-sync` is driven end to end against a loopback HTTP stub that
  implements S3's conditional-write semantics, and the signature is validated against
  botocore rather than against a live 200. To close it: a **non-production** bucket plus a
  least-privilege key limited to `s3:PutObject`/`s3:GetObject`/`s3:ListBucket` on that bucket
  and prefix, then one real cycle asserting ciphertext at rest and a byte-exact round trip.
  (2) **`rsync-sync`'s ssh hop is proved at the argv level only** — behaviour is driven
  against a real `rsync` to a local target (push/list/pull/insert-only/CAS all real), and the
  ssh leg is asserted on the exact command plus every injection vector, but no sshd was
  contacted. To close it: any host with key-based ssh and a writable directory, then the same
  two-machine convergence DAS-6d-iii ran over `dir-sync`. (3) **Two-machine convergence over
  these transports** (criterion 4's shape) is not re-run here; core proved it over a real
  transport in DAS-6d-iii and the codec boundary is transport-agnostic, but the specific
  pairing is untested. (4) `rsync-sync` is unverified against **GNU rsync 3.x** — only
  openrsync was available; the flag set was chosen to be 2.6.9-compatible precisely so this
  is a low risk, but it is a real gap.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-8b] **Gates.** Apps repo — all four CI jobs run locally and green: 47
  manifests valid (round-trip stable), import-boundary lint clean (`gideon.sdk.*` only),
  per-bundle tests **`s3-sync` 60 passed · `rsync-sync` 77 passed** (run per bundle; a
  combined run raises `import file mismatch` on the duplicate `test_provider.py` basename),
  DCO sign-off present on both commits with no agent trailers. Core — `make lint` **exit 0**
  (black/isort/flake8 + mypy, 919 source files), `scripts/gate_report.py` **all 3 gates pass**
  (the help-string edit does not drift `config-baseline.json`, which records path/type/
  default/sensitive and not help text), and `test_durability_sync_crypto` +
  `test_config_roundtrip` + `test_durability_sync_cycle` + `test_apps_import_boundary` +
  `test_provider_registry` + `test_app_manifest` + `test_sync_transport_contract` +
  `test_durability_sync_service` = **212 passed, 1 skipped**. Every test sets both
  `GIDEON_HOME` and `GIDEON_WORKSPACE` to a tmp path — `net.fetch` writes a SEL
  audit row per egress decision, so the s3 suite would otherwise have written into the real
  home on every request.
---

## Execution log — DAS-9 (§5 workspace time-travel) — **PARTIAL**

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **DONE — the engine, the seam, the debounce, rollback/revert/preview, the
  hourly memory commit, the endpoints and the panel.** New `durability/state_history.py` (roots,
  per-root repo, deny-by-default ignore, commit, timeline, preview, rollback, revert, forward refs)
  and `durability/history_debounce.py` (adaptive 10s→0 debounce, serialized per root). The seam is
  `atomic_write.register_post_write_hook` at the single `_atomic_write` callsite, which covers both
  `atomic_write` and `atomic_write_bytes`; a failing hook cannot fail a write and a hook that writes
  cannot recurse. `run_history_commit()` joins `run_due_jobs` on its own `last_history` hourly key
  (§3's deferred piece), attributed `scheduled`. Three routes: `GET /api/durability/history`,
  `GET …/{root}/timeline`, `POST …/{root}/{rollback|revert}`. FE: Settings → Backups → **Time
  travel** (root picker, timeline, "what changed while I slept" filter, rendered diff preview,
  rollback + revert). Config: `durability.time_travel` (all five legs — dataclass + `_meta`,
  `load()` fail-open, `to_dict()`, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` PATCH, FE toggle).

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **DESIGN — the repo is a separate git DIR, never a `.git` in the user's tree.**
  `git init --bare <home>/state-history/<root>.git` + `core.bare=false` + `--work-tree=<the tree>`,
  so nothing appears inside the home or the workspace and no other subsystem (or the user's own
  tooling) can trip over one. The ignore rules live in `<gitdir>/info/exclude`, which is also why
  "secrets are gitignored" is structural rather than a maintained denylist: the `config` root's work
  tree IS the home, and its exclude is `/*` then `!/config.json` + `!/entity_settings/` — the
  credential store and `.local_secret` are never re-included, so no future edit can leak them.
  `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` + `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` + `core.hooksPath=` keeps the user's
  global config (a `hooksPath`, a signing requirement) out of the history path. Every git call
  asserts its git dir sits under `<home>/state-history` and ends in `.git`; no code path accepts a
  caller-supplied git dir, because this module runs `reset --hard` for a living.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **BOTH HALVES OF THE SECRET CLAIM ARE PROVEN, and they are proven differently.**
  (1) *Never committed*: `test_a_secret_never_enters_a_commit_object` walks `rev-list --all --objects`
  and `cat-file -p`s every blob in both the `config` and `skills` repos, asserting no
  `.env`/`credentials` path and no secret bytes anywhere in history — `ls-files` would have missed a
  secret committed once and removed later. (2) *Preserved across a rollback*: `reset --hard` only
  rewrites TRACKED paths and this module never runs `git clean`, so the ignored `.env` and
  `security/credentials.json` survive with unchanged bytes. Falsified by adding
  `git clean -fdx` after the reset → *"AssertionError: the ignored secret was deleted by the
  rollback"* plus a `FileNotFoundError` on the credential store.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **"NEVER SYNCS" IS PROVEN BY BUILDING THE ENTRY SET, not by reading a list.**
  `state-history` joins `inventory.IGNORED` (beside `sync` and `shards`) — IGNORED rather than
  declared, because a declared entry would put a git object database into every export and grafting
  one machine's undo history onto another's tree is the opposite of one-writer-per-mechanism. The
  rail runs the REAL `shards.export_shards()` over a home with a POPULATED history (vacuity floor:
  >10 history files and a non-zero commit count) and asserts no produced path or byte derives from
  it, plus `audit_home()` stays green. Falsified two ways: dropping `"state-history"` from IGNORED
  reds the audit rail (`assert inv.is_ignored('state-history')` → False), and DECLARING it as a
  plain `tree` entry reds both export rails (`assert '.git' not in '{...pid\n.git/\n'` — the
  history's own exclude file inside a shard).

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **THE DEBOUNCE IS DRIVEN BY AN INJECTED CLOCK, never by sleeping.**
  `HistoryDebouncer` owns no time: it takes `clock` + `committer` and is driven by
  `run_pending(now=…)`, which a one-line daemon thread calls on a 0.5s cadence in production. So the
  collapse is measured, not timed — five writes inside the window produce ZERO commits, and one pass
  after the window produces exactly one commit carrying `writes=5`. Serialization is measured with a
  barrier: two threads are held inside the committer and the second observes `skipped: "busy"`, with
  `peak == 1` and the skipped work re-armed rather than lost (a depth-1 queue per root). Both rails
  carry their own vacuity check — `test_the_rail_fails_when_the_debounce_is_disabled` drives the same
  writes with everything forced due and asserts three separate commits, and falsifying
  `delay_for_writes` to `return 0.0` reds the collapse rail
  (`assert [{'root': 'co...': True, ...}] == []`) while falsifying the per-root lock to a fresh
  `threading.Lock()` reds the serialization rail (*"the second pass must observe the root as BUSY —
  otherwise this rail never exercised the lock and proves nothing"*).

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **THE MANDATORY PREVIEW IS SERVER-ENFORCED, not a frontend convention.**
  One endpoint per operation, two phases: no `confirm` returns the preview and touches nothing, and
  a confirming request must echo the `expected_head` that preview returned. A caller therefore
  cannot produce a valid confirm without having received a preview, and a preview that went stale is
  refused (409 `preview_stale`) rather than applied to a tree the user never saw. Falsified on both
  sides: neutering the server check (`if False and expected != prev["head"]`) reds two route rails
  (`assert 200 == 409`), and making the panel send `''` as the head reds the FE rail (*expected
  "durabilityHistoryApply" to be called with …*).

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **BUG FOUND AND FIXED IN MY OWN CODE: `str.splitlines()` eats `\x1e`.**
  `forward_refs` formatted `for-each-ref` records with `\x1e` (ASCII record separator) and read them
  back with `splitlines()` — which treats `\x1e` as a LINE boundary, so every record shattered into
  single fields and the function returned `[]` over a repo that demonstrably held the ref. The git
  command was correct and its stdout was correct; only the parse was wrong, which is exactly the
  shape that reads as "the feature does not work". Field separator is now `\x1f` with an explicit
  `split("\n")`.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **DISCOVERY — an isolated home does NOT confine the workspace, and this plan's
  own service tests were exposed.** `tests/test_durability_service.py`'s autouse `_isolate` set only
  `GIDEON_HOME`; `workspace_root()` falls through to the real
  `~/workplace/gideon-workspace`, so the new hourly job would have taken the developer's REAL
  memory notes as a git work tree. Verified no damage on this machine (no `.git` and no
  `state-history` anywhere under the real home or workspace) and pinned `GIDEON_WORKSPACE` in
  that fixture, so the next job to reach the workspace inherits the isolation instead of
  rediscovering this. Three existing scheduling assertions were updated for the new cadence key
  (`last_history`), and `test_the_hourly_job_comes_due_before_the_nightly` now names both hourly
  jobs rather than one.

- [2026-08-18][DAS-9] **UNMET, deliberately, with evidence.**
  (1) **`plan_memory/`** from the §5 root list **does not exist in the codebase** — `grep -rn
  "plan_memory" src/` returns nothing — so it is not a root. Declaring one would be dead code.
  (2) **The `background` writing surface has no producer.** `state_history.writing_surface()` +
  `_dominant_surface` carry it end to end and the hourly job sets `scheduled`, so the panel's "what
  changed while I slept" filter is non-vacuous today; but nothing yet wraps an unattended trigger
  dispatch in `writing_surface(SURFACE_BACKGROUND)`. The signal exists —
  `guardrails.policy.is_unattended_session` (`gateway.py:256`) — and wiring it is a one-line change
  at `gateway.py:975`'s dispatch, deliberately left out of this atom's fence.
  (3) **Criterion 6's `git log -p` half is met; its "restore the memory tree via the panel" half is
  met for a whole root, not for a file subset** — `rollback`/`revert` operate on a root, and a
  per-file restore is not built.
  (4) **`state-history` lives at `<home>/state-history/`, not `<home>/backups/state-history/`**
  (DEVIATION): no `backups/` directory exists in the home — the tar output is `snapshots/` — so a
  new nesting level would have been invented for one consumer.
  (5) **Not driven through a live gateway.** Proven by unit + route + FE-render rails only.

- [2026-08-20][DAS-9] **DONE — the five items recorded UNMET on 2026-08-18 are resolved.** Two were
  never work: (1) `plan_memory/` still returns **0 hits** in `src/`, so declaring it a root would be
  dead code, and (4) `state-history` living at `<home>/state-history/` stands as the recorded
  DEVIATION — confirmed live, the running gateway creates exactly that directory. The other three
  were built or driven this session.

- [2026-08-20][DAS-9] **(2) `SURFACE_BACKGROUND` has a producer.** Before: the only
  `writing_surface(...)` call in the tree was `state_history.py:772`, the hourly job setting
  `SCHEDULED`, so an unattended write was recorded with no surface and the panel's "what changed
  while I slept" filter could not distinguish it. The unattended dispatch in `gateway.py` now wraps
  in `writing_surface(SURFACE_BACKGROUND)`, reusing the existing unattendedness decision rather than
  minting a second notion of it. Railed by a census with a vacuity floor (it must also find the known
  `SCHEDULED` producer) plus an attended-path counterexample, so "everything is background" cannot
  pass.

- [2026-08-20][DAS-9] **(3) Per-file restore.** `preview_rollback`/`preview_revert`/`preview`/
  `rollback`/`revert` take `paths=None|[]` (whole root, byte-identical to before) or a repo-relative
  subset; previews and results carry the normalized `paths`. The rollback/revert distinction holds
  per file — per-file rollback restores those paths as of the target and discards later edits to
  them, per-file revert reverse-applies only that commit and KEEPS later edits — because the panel's
  copy promises exactly that, and collapsing them would make the copy false. An escaping or unknown
  path raises rather than being silently dropped: a dropped path is a restore the user believes
  happened.
  **The two-phase contract was extended to the path set.** `expected_head` alone no longer binds a
  subset operation to what the user saw, so a confirm must also echo `expected_paths`; a mismatch is
  refused with `preview_paths_mismatch` (409). Falsified by disabling that comparison: 4 red across
  widening, substituting, narrowing-a-whole-root-preview, and omitting the token.

- [2026-08-20][DAS-9] **(5) Driven through a live gateway — and it found a bug the rails could not.**
  On a real gateway over an isolated home: five roots declared; the timeline renders with
  `surface: "interactive"`; a per-file preview returns a real diff and changes nothing; a mismatched
  confirm is refused 409 `preview_paths_mismatch` with the value on disk unchanged; a matched confirm
  applies, returns `paths: ["config.json"]`, parks the prior HEAD in a service ref, and the setting
  reverts. (It reverts to the value at the first flush, not the first PATCH — the debounce coalesces
  writes inside its window, which is what "adaptive" means.) A bogus path is refused 400
  `invalid_path` naming it.
  **The bug:** three real config PATCHes left the `config` root at `exists=False, commits=0`.
  `PATCH /api/config/gideon` wrote through `agent._atomic_json_write`, whose own mkstemp+rename
  never fires the post-write hook — while the PUT path in the same file already used `atomic_write`.
  Routed through the seam, the identical drive yields `exists=True, commits=1`. Reproduced both ways
  on a fresh home.

- [2026-08-20][DAS-9] **A limit worth recording, because two falsifications found it and a future
  reader would otherwise over-trust the test.** Neither counting post-write hook invocations nor
  asserting that a commit lands discriminates the seam fix in-harness: another writer in the PATCH
  flow already notifies the seam once for that path (measured: bypass 1, `atomic_write` 2), and that
  notification creates a pending entry which both `flush()` and `run_pending()` drain. So a commit
  appears under either writer in a unit test. The pin for the specific regression is a source rail
  naming the bypassing writer; the evidence for the change is the live A/B. The test file says so
  rather than implying a stronger guarantee.

- [2026-08-20][DAS-9] **Gates:** `make lint` clean (mypy, 941 source files) · 236 passed across the
  durability/state-history/route suites, plus 189 on the seam-fix pass · web `typecheck` clean,
  **455 files / 4735 tests**, `build` ok · probe sweep 13 (the benign baseline).
  **Process note:** all four implementation subagents died mid-flight on an API auth error
  (403 "Please run /login"), one of them mid-falsification. No live mutation was left behind — the
  sweep was clean and every source file was already committed — and their final uncommitted test
  hardening was recovered, verified (45 passed) and committed before the gate.
