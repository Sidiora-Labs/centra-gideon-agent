# SECURITY-HARDENING

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/SH.md`](../atomic/SH.md) as 10 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Security Hardening — Deep Features Beyond Legibility

**Status:** DESIGNED — deepened 2026-07-18 with code recon (initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18; owner: "let's do this but towards the end of the roadmap")
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Wave:** 4 — deliberately late; SECURITY-LEGIBILITY (Wave 0) carries the launch-time trust story.
**Depends on:** SECURITY-LEGIBILITY (the threat model that prioritizes this — its DISCOVERY entries seed candidate scope), CI-RELEASE-ENGINEERING (fuzz jobs, signing infra), ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING S2 (the registry signed manifests protect). The keychain slice (S1) is class B and reversible-migration-bearing, which is why this plan is ordered late (see the T1.2 note).
**Scope:** the security *features* deepening an already-strong architecture — credential storage, artifact signing, adversarial gate testing, the user-facing audit surface, external review. **Soul guardrail:** enforcement-over-request stands — every addition is a chokepoint control, never a prompt-side plea; and no addition may weaken a fail-closed default for convenience. This plan does not re-architect; it deepens existing chokepoints.

---

## Context (code recon, 2026-07-18)

- **Credentials:** `.env` (0600) via `config/loader.py::save_credential`; **no keyring backend today** (only an unrelated ssh-keyring path string in `acp/transport.py`).
- **Scanner is well-structured for fuzzing:** `supply_chain.py` — `Verdict`(rank), `TrustTier`, `Finding`, `ScanReport`(is_dangerous), `SkillScanner.scan(staged_dir, tier)` / `scan_text` / `_scan_script` / `_scan_invisible` (invisible-char detection already exists) / `_aggregate`. Clean seams for a corpus harness.
- **SEL has verification already:** `sel.py::verify_integrity(max_entries)` returns (checked, ok) — the chain-verify indicator for the audit page is a read away; periodic trim + startup verify already run.
- **Security panel exists:** `/api/security/{stats,denied-commands,egress}` — the SEL audit view extends this surface.

## Design

- **S1 — OS keychain (class B, consent-triggered reversible migration):** a keyring backend behind the existing `save_credential`/read API (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service via `keyring` lib as an *optional* extra — headless/container installs without a secret service **fail closed to `.env` 0600**, never fail open to plaintext-elsewhere). Lifecycle: opt-in → default-new-installs → migrate-on-consent (a migration moves `.env` secrets into the keychain, leaving `.env` keys absent; export exclusions unchanged; rollback = the pre-migration snapshot). `doctor` reports the active credential backend.
- **S2 — signed manifests + registry trust:** maintainer signing of first-party + registry-listed bundles (minisign or Sigstore keyless — decide against CI capabilities in the task; minisign is simpler, no OIDC dance, one public key shipped in-tree). The Store verifies signatures and renders state on the consent surface (`signed by <known key>` / `unsigned — community tier`); **unsigned stays installable at community tier** (graduated trust, never a hard wall — the supply-chain-tier doctrine). Registry (`ECOSYSTEM-TOOLING`) records signer identity per listing.
- **S3 — adversarial gate testing:** a hypothesis-driven corpus against `SkillScanner`/`install_guarded`: archive attacks (symlink escape, path traversal, case-collision, zip-slip), the scanned-bytes==installed-bytes integrity invariant under concurrent install races, verdict-evasion (obfuscated/split dangerous patterns, invisible-char tricks the existing `_scan_invisible` should catch — prove it), degenerate/oversized manifests. Corpus committed; nightly CI job; **publish the corpus + methodology** (`docs/security/scanner-testing.md`).
- **S4 — SEL as a user surface + external review:** a "What did my agent do" audit page (filter by caller/operation/outcome/downstream-service, chain-verify indicator from `verify_integrity`, export) extending the security panel; and an external review (commissioned or a structured public self-audit) of the highest-risk paths — webhook auth (`_verify_hook_token`), app reverse-proxy token model, scanner bypasses, egress guard layering, inbound surfaces (plans 41/24) — findings published with fixes per SECURITY.md.

## Contracts & Interfaces (conventions per [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### C1 — Credential backend selector (behind existing `save_credential`/read API, §2.5 — callers unchanged)
```python
CredentialBackend = Literal["keychain", "dotenv"]
def credential_backend() -> CredentialBackend: ...   # keychain if available+enabled, else dotenv
# save_credential(key, value) routes to the active backend; reads are backend-transparent.
# Absent secret service (headless/container) → dotenv fallback + doctor warn. NEVER plaintext-elsewhere (fail-closed to the MORE protected store).
```
`keyring` as an optional extra. Class B. Consent-triggered migration `credentials_to_keychain` (moves `.env` secrets → keychain, removes keys from `.env`; snapshot-backed; rollback restores `.env`). **Shares this backend with EXECUTION-ISOLATION's secret vault** (build once — the two must not fork two credential backends).

### C2 — Manifest signature (minisign recommended; decide in T2.1)
`ScanReport`/consent payload gains `signature: {state: "signed"|"unsigned"|"invalid", signer: str}`. Store verifies if present; **unsigned → community tier, still installable** (graduated trust). Public key shipped in-tree; `scripts/sign_app.py` for maintainers. Registry (plan 38) records signer per listing.

### C3 — Adversarial corpus layout
`tests/security/corpus/<class>/` for the five classes (archive, integrity-race, verdict-evasion, invisible-char, degenerate-manifest); `tests/security/test_scanner_adversarial.py` (hypothesis strategies + fixed fixtures) against `SkillScanner.scan`/`install_guarded`. Published methodology `docs/security/scanner-testing.md`. Nightly job in `full.yml`.

### C4 — SEL audit surface (reuses `verify_integrity`, §3.3)
`GET /api/security/audit` (paginated, filters: caller/operation/outcome/downstream_service/time) + `GET /api/security/audit/verify` → `{checked, ok}` (wraps `verify_integrity`). Export = credential-safe JSONL (reuse `redact`). Frontend page under Settings → Security.

### Integration points
- **Calls:** `save_credential`/credential store, `SkillScanner`/`install_guarded`, `sel().verify_integrity`, the consent-triggered credential migration, `redact`.
- **Consumed by:** plan 38 (registry signer records), plan 13 (shared credential backend).
- **Owner-critical:** the signing private key (owner task 2). Its recovery note lives with this plan's owner task 2 — plan 37's continuity doc was descoped 2026-07-31, so this plan owns the safeguarding record.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under the roadmap session discipline in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md))

### Session 1 — OS keychain credential storage

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | Keyring backend behind the credential API: `save_credential`/read gain a backend selector (`keychain` | `dotenv`), `keyring` as an optional extra; **absent secret service → fall back to `.env` 0600 with a doctor warning (never plaintext-elsewhere)** | `src/gideon/config/loader.py`, `pyproject.toml` extra, `cli_doctor.py` | reads are backend-transparent; headless fixture (no keyring) uses `.env`; backend reported by doctor; unit tests both backends |
| T1.2 | Credential migration `credentials_to_keychain` (moves `.env` secrets → keychain, removes the keys from `.env`; idempotent; snapshot-backed; rollback restores `.env`), triggered on explicit user consent | `src/gideon/config/loader.py` (+ a small migration helper) | migration fixture (with a fake keyring) moves + verifies; rollback restores; `portability` export still excludes secrets |

> **This is the one class-B slice that is NOT a plain clean break.** Everywhere
> else during 0.x, a class-B change ships as a clean break under the pre-1.0
> banner. Here it must not: **silently losing a user's stored credentials is not
> an acceptable clean break**, so the keychain move is an idempotent,
> snapshot-backed, reversible migration built directly against the credential API
> — the rollback path is the point of the task. There is no `lifecycle/` gate
> registry to lean on (the migration-backed regime is deferred), so the migration
> is consent-triggered and its own reversibility is the safeguard. This is the
> reason SECURITY-HARDENING is ordered late.
| T1.3 | Settings → Security note: which backend is active + a "move to keychain" action (triggers the migration with the snapshot confirm) | security settings component | action runs the migration with a visible snapshot step; state reflects post-migration |
| V1 | Validation: on macOS — migrate a test credential into Keychain, confirm chat still authenticates, rollback restores `.env`; on a headless fixture — confirm `.env` fallback + warning | — | both paths recorded |

### Session 2 — Signed manifests + registry trust

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Signing scheme decision + doc (minisign recommended; record rationale), signing key generated (owner task 2), public key shipped in-tree; a `scripts/sign_app.py` for maintainers | `docs/security/signing.md`, `scripts/sign_app.py`, public key file | signing + verifying a sample bundle round-trips locally |
| T2.2 | Store verification: at install, verify signature if present; `ScanReport`/consent payload gains `signature: {state, signer}`; consent UI renders it; **unsigned → community tier, still installable** | `supply_chain.py` or `apps/app_manager.py` install path, consent UI | signed first-party bundle shows "signed by Gideon"; tampered signature → refused with reason; unsigned → community-tier consent |
| T2.3 | Release pipeline signs first-party app bundles + core release artifacts; registry (plan 38) records signer per listing | `release.yml`, registry validation script | released bundles carry valid signatures (CI-verified) |
| V2 | Validation: install signed, unsigned, and tamper-signed fixtures — each behaves per design | — | holds |

### Session 3 — Adversarial gate testing

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.1 | Corpus harness: hypothesis strategies + fixed malicious fixtures for the five attack classes (archive, integrity-race, verdict-evasion, invisible-char, degenerate-manifest) against `SkillScanner`/`install_guarded` | `tests/security/test_scanner_adversarial.py`, `tests/security/corpus/` | each class has ≥1 asserting test; any that surfaces a real bypass files an issue + fix (or a documented accepted-risk with rationale) |
| T3.2 | Concurrency/integrity: a test forcing a swap-after-scan attempt proves the scanned-bytes==installed-bytes invariant holds under a race | scanner install path test | race fixture cannot land unscanned bytes |
| T3.3 | Nightly CI job + published methodology (`docs/security/scanner-testing.md`, corpus described, how to run) | `.github/workflows/full.yml`, doc | nightly runs the corpus; doc lets an outsider reproduce |
| V3 | Validation: introduce a deliberate scanner weakness on a branch → corpus catches it | — | red-on-weakness proven |

### Session 4 — SEL surface + external review

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4.1 | Audit API: paginated SEL read with filters (caller/operation/outcome/downstream_service/time) + a chain-verify endpoint wrapping `verify_integrity` | `dashboard/handlers/` security module, routes beside `/api/security/*` | filters work; verify endpoint returns (checked, ok) with a tamper fixture showing ok=false |
| T4.2 | "What did my agent do" page: filterable SEL table, chain-verify indicator, export (jsonl, credential-safe — reuse redaction) | `web/src/pages/settings/` security/audit view | page renders real events; export excludes secrets (fixture-verified); both themes/WCAG |
| T4.3 | External-review scoping doc: the five high-risk paths, review format (commissioned vs structured self-audit), publication plan | `docs/security/review-scope.md` | scope approved (owner task 3); review executed or scheduled with a date |
| V4 | Validation: audit page over a seeded SEL with a deliberately-broken chain link shows the break; export round-trips | — | holds |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **macOS Keychain validation** (V1) — 15 min on your Mac.
2. **Generate + safeguard the signing key** (S2): create the minisign (or Sigstore identity) keypair; the private key is a release-critical secret — store it in your password manager + the CI `release` environment, and record its recovery in this plan (plan 37's continuity doc was descoped 2026-07-31). This is a keep-it-safe-forever artifact.
3. **Decide external review** (S4): budget for a professional audit of the five paths (a scoped agent-security review is a real line item) vs. a published structured self-audit. Either is credible; the choice is yours to fund.
4. **Approve publishing the scanner corpus** (S3) — it advertises exactly how your gate is tested (a strength, but your call to make it public).

## Risks & open questions

- **`keyring` dependency reliability** across Linux desktops varies (Secret Service presence) — the fail-closed-to-`.env` default contains it; keychain is an upgrade, never a requirement.
- **Signing key loss** would break the update/trust chain — owner task 2's safeguarding + its recovery note (kept in this plan; plan 37's continuity doc was descoped 2026-07-31) are the mitigation; minisign's simplicity (single keypair, no CA) is deliberately chosen to make recovery tractable.
- **Open:** whether to pursue a CVE-numbering-authority relationship or just GitHub advisories — GitHub advisories suffice at this scale; revisit if adoption warrants (ratchet).

## Amendment (2026-07-26 — sibling-platform gap analysis, owner greenlight)

**What & why.** Tamper-resistant baseline denylist. Recon confirms the premise with one correction: `denied_command_patterns()` (security.py:658) returns `BUILTIN_DENIED_COMMAND_PATTERNS + user additions` — the 112-entry built-in list (verified count) is a module constant that user config can only APPEND to, never remove, so the *read path* is already add-only. The real gaps: (1) the baseline lives only as importable module state — an agent-written `sitecustomize`/monkeypatch, a tampered install, or a future refactor could mutate the list with no detection (the S1 Doctor DISCOVERY already flagged `redact()`'s narrowness to this plan — same anti-tamper family); (2) nothing *asserts* at runtime that the effective list is a superset of the packaged baseline; (3) permissive approval modes must be provably irrelevant — recon shows `_denied_bash_reason` runs before execution unconditionally (builtin_tools.py:1443, upstream of the approval gate; `auto/yolo` at runtime.py:968 only skips the *ask*), which this amendment locks in as a tested invariant rather than an accident of ordering. **Honest limitation:** the user owns the box and can edit the installed package; this is anti-drift and anti-LLM-tamper, not anti-owner.

**Design (contract level).**
- Baseline ships as a **packaged data file** `security/baseline_denylist.json` `{version, sha256, patterns[]}` (single source; `BUILTIN_DENIED_COMMAND_PATTERNS` becomes the loaded copy). `denied_command_patterns()` re-asserts on every read via a cheap cached-integrity check: recompute the in-memory list's hash against the packaged sha; mismatch → reload from the packaged file + `sel().log(SecurityEvent(event_type="baseline_denylist_reasserted", …))`. The 30s heartbeat-adjacent doctor probe re-verifies periodically.
- **Removal attempts ignored + logged:** config keys that could shadow the baseline (a hypothetical `security.removed_denied_commands` or list-typed overwrite of the merged view) are rejected at `load()`; any user pattern textually equal to a baseline entry is deduped silently; a PATCH attempting to shrink the effective set below baseline returns the standard error envelope `{code: "baseline_denylist_immutable"}` + SEL `baseline_denylist_tamper_attempt`.
- **Mode-independence invariant:** a test matrix asserting `execute_bash` refuses a baseline-matched command under every approval policy (`default`, `auto`, `yolo`, `acceptEdits`) and under trust-level simulators — the deny check at builtin_tools.py:1443 precedes approval and must stay there (regression-pinned). Guardrails' `denylist.py:164` merge (which also concatenates the baseline) inherits the same source file, so action-provider dispatch stays in lockstep.

**Lands in:** extends **Session 3** (adversarial gate testing — the baseline-integrity fixtures are a sixth corpus class: `baseline-tamper`) plus one small task in Session 4's surface work. Count stays **4 sessions** (S3 grows by ~half a session, absorbed; recorded honestly here).

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3.4 | Baseline as packaged data (`baseline_denylist.json` + sha), loader with integrity re-assert on read + periodic re-verify; SEL events `baseline_denylist_reasserted`/`_tamper_attempt`; user config strictly additive (dedupe, no shrink path) | `src/gideon/security.py`, `src/gideon/security/baseline_denylist.json`, `guardrails/denylist.py` | mutating the in-memory list at runtime is healed on next read + SEL-logged; effective set is provably ⊇ packaged baseline (property test); user additions still merge |
| T3.5 | Mode-independence matrix: baseline-matched command refused under default/auto/yolo/acceptEdits and all trust simulators; deny-before-approval ordering regression-pinned; `baseline-tamper` corpus class added to the S3 harness | `tests/security/test_scanner_adversarial.py`, `tests/security/corpus/baseline-tamper/`, native runtime/builtin_tools tests | every mode fixture refuses; reordering the deny check below the approval gate turns CI red |
| T4.4 | Security panel: baseline shown read-only with version + verified-hash indicator and "N user additions"; docs state the anti-drift/anti-LLM-tamper (not anti-owner) threat model honestly | `dashboard/handlers/core.py` (`/api/security/denied-commands` payload), security settings page, `docs/security/` | panel renders baseline-verified state; tamper fixture flips the indicator; limitation documented |

## Execution log

### 2026-08-14 — SH-10 (Amendment T4.4) the Security panel renders the verified baseline — DONE

SH-6 built the verification; nothing showed it. The panel listed 112 patterns with no way to
tell a healthy instance from a drifted one, and counted the user's config list rather than what
that list actually adds.

- **Payload** — `GET /api/security/denied-commands`
  (`dashboard/handlers/core.py::api_security_denied_commands`) now returns, alongside the
  existing `builtin`/`user` arrays: a `baseline` block (`version`, `sha256`, enforced `count`,
  `verified`, `detail`) sourced from `verify_baseline_denylist()`, and `user_additions`.
- **`user_additions` is derived, not counted** — `len(denied_command_patterns()) - len(baseline)`.
  `len(config.security.denied_commands)` is the obvious implementation and it is wrong: a user
  entry equal to a built-in is deduped by `denied_command_patterns()` and widens nothing. Verified
  live: config `['aws s3 cp .* s3://.*', 'my-secret-tool .*', 'aws s3 cp .* s3://.*']` → 3 entries,
  `user_additions: 1`.
- **The indicator flips, and the identity shown stays the verified one** — with the packaged file
  diverged, `verified` goes `false` and `detail` names the divergence, while `version`, `sha256` and
  `count` keep reporting the baseline actually in force. A diverged file is reported, never adopted,
  so the panel must not start advertising the attacker's version.
- **Panel** (`web/src/pages/settings/SecurityPanel.tsx`) — the baseline chip's **role flips with the
  state**: `status` when it matches what shipped, `alert` when it does not (unrequested news that
  changes what the list below means). Both carry an explicit `aria-label` because `status`/`alert`
  take no name from content — without one the chip would be an unnamed live region. The baseline
  region stays read-only (asserted by role, as the *absence* of a control inside it, with the user
  row's Remove button as the vacuity guard).
- **Both reads went bare** — `securityStats` and `deniedCommands` dropped `.catch(() => null)`, and
  the panel branches on `error` into `LoadError`. This is the one surface where a swallowed read is
  worse than a blank one: an empty denylist and "nothing is blocked" are the same picture. The gate
  is `!s`, not `s === undefined`, because the settings hub shares the `settings:security` cache key
  and still persists a substituted `null` into `sessionStorage`.
- **Docs** — extended `docs/security/threat-model.md` (boundary 1) with **Baseline denylist
  integrity: anti-drift and anti-LLM-tamper, not anti-owner**: what the digest does catch (on-disk
  corruption, a partial write, an edit that changed patterns but not the digest, in-process mutation,
  and a *self-consistent* rewrite of both — the fingerprint is held in memory from import) and what
  it does not (the owner; anyone who can edit the installed package before startup). A matching
  bullet joined "What we deliberately don't defend against". `limitations.md` was left alone: this is
  a boundary with a control and a stated non-goal, not a known gap.
- **Tests** — `tests/test_baseline_denylist_integrity.py::TestSecurityPanelPayload` (6) and
  `web/src/pages/settings/securityBaselineState.test.tsx` (11).

**DEVIATION — fixed two swapped copy strings in the same file.** `SecurityPanel.tsx`'s two
`unavailableWhen` reasons were exactly transposed: the shell-denylist Add said "Enter a host first"
and the egress host Adds said "Enter a pattern first". Both land in `title`, so the wrong noun is
what a hover and a description read. One-word correction, no mechanism change, pinned by
`securityBaselineState.test.tsx` (falsified: re-swapping turns it red). Out of the atom's literal
scope, but leaving a wrong string in a file being edited for legibility would be the wrong trade.

**DISCOVERY — reading the panel writes SEL when the baseline has diverged.** The handler calls
`verify_baseline_denylist()`, which logs `baseline_denylist_tamper_attempt` on a diverged file with
no per-digest dedup on that path (unlike the unrecoverable-read path). Every panel load, including a
background revalidation, therefore appends a row while the file stays diverged. Kept deliberately —
an owner viewing a diverged baseline is an auditable event, and it is the same behaviour the periodic
doctor probe already has — rather than adding a second, non-logging status accessor that could drift
from the enforcing one. Documented in the handler docstring. If the row volume ever matters, the fix
belongs in `security.py`'s reporting guard, not in a parallel read path.

**DISCOVERY — a suite-wide `GIDEON_HOME` fails ~11 tests that are green without it.**
Measuring the baseline with `GIDEON_HOME` exported for the whole run produced 12 failures
across `test_portability`, `test_mcp_core`, `test_ephemeral_sessions` and
`test_harness_workflow_resume_audit`; the same four files pass 132/132 on the same commit with the
variable unset. The failures are the env var, not the tree. Recorded so the next session does not
inherit a phantom baseline.

### 2026-08-14 — SH-6 (Amendment T3.4) baseline denylist as packaged data — DONE

The baseline bash denylist is now a packaged, integrity-verified data file that heals
itself on read, and both enforcement paths load it from one source.

- **`src/gideon/baseline_denylist.json`** — `{version: 1, description, sha256,
  patterns[]}`, all 112 previously-in-code patterns byte-for-byte, digest
  `2b7db3c6…c6e872` (sha256 over the newline-joined patterns, so content *and* order are
  covered — first-match-wins ordering is part of the baseline).
- **`security.py`** — `_read_packaged_baseline()` reads and verifies the file at import
  and **raises** on a missing file, malformed JSON, an empty pattern list, or a digest
  that disagrees with the patterns. `BUILTIN_DENIED_COMMAND_PATTERNS` becomes the loaded
  copy; the verified tuple + its fingerprint are held as `_BASELINE_PATTERNS` /
  `_BASELINE_SHA256`. `baseline_denied_command_patterns()` re-asserts on every read: one
  sha256 over ~110 short strings on the fast path (silent), and on mismatch it heals the
  list **in place** from the snapshot, or re-reads the file if the snapshot itself was
  rebound. `denied_command_patterns()` then appends user patterns deduped against the
  baseline, so the result is always a superset in the baseline's original order.
- **SEL, two distinct kinds.** `baseline_denylist_reasserted` (outcome `healed`) fires
  when in-memory drift was repaired, carrying `restored_count`/`restored_sample`.
  `baseline_denylist_tamper_attempt` (outcome `rejected`) fires when a shrink was
  refused: the periodic re-verify found the packaged file no longer matching the
  fingerprint captured at import, or no verified source remained. A cold untampered read
  emits nothing; the unrecoverable case is reported once per distinct broken state
  (`_BASELINE_TAMPER_REPORTED`) rather than once per screened command.
- **Fail-closed everywhere.** After import the file is never consulted for *content* —
  deleting or rewriting it cannot shrink what is enforced. `verify_baseline_denylist()`
  reports a diverged file instead of adopting it; with no verified source left the effective
  set is the union of every copy seen, never a smaller one.
- **Periodic re-verify** — Doctor probe `security.baseline_denylist` (capability
  `security`, Tier.CAPABILITY) runs `verify_baseline_denylist()` off-loop and goes red on
  a diverged file while the verified baseline stays in force.
- **Shared source** — `guardrails/denylist.py` and the `/api/security/denied-commands`
  payload both call `baseline_denied_command_patterns()`; no module but `security.py`
  names the data file (asserted by a test), so the two enforcement paths cannot drift.
- **Both packaging surfaces** — `pyproject.toml` package-data *and*
  `gideon-backend.spec` `_backend_data()`; PyInstaller's import analysis cannot see
  a data file. Verified by building the wheel (`gideon/baseline_denylist.json`
  present) and by a test asserting both declarations.
- **Tests** — `tests/test_baseline_denylist_integrity.py`, 45 cases: the heal (clear,
  single-entry removal, reordering, rebound snapshot, no-source-left), the superset
  property over ~215 configs (every baseline entry echoed back one at a time, duplicates,
  five shadow-key shapes, 200 seeded random mixes), the identical-pattern no-shrink case,
  the periodic re-verify incl. a self-consistent file rewrite, the Doctor probe both ways,
  the shared-source rails, and a matching-behaviour regression matrix plus a pinned
  baseline digest.
- **Falsified twice.** Disabling the re-assert (returning the live list unchecked) turns 7
  tests red including every heal case; letting a user pattern equal to a baseline entry
  remove it turns the superset property test red, naming the offending config.

**DEVIATION (file location).** The amendment names
`src/gideon/security/baseline_denylist.json`, but `security` is a module, not a
package — that path cannot exist alongside `security.py`. The file ships at
`src/gideon/baseline_denylist.json`, the same package-root spot as
`model_pricing.json` / `model_tokens.json`.

**DEVIATION (`baseline_denylist_immutable` envelope).** The amendment's PATCH error
envelope was not added. `security.denied_commands` is the only config write surface and it
is additive by type, so the envelope would have had no reachable trigger — an inert control.
The removal-attempt path is instead covered by the tamper-attempt event on a rejected
shrink, plus a test proving shadow keys (`removed_denied_commands`,
`denied_commands_override`, `baseline_denied_commands`, `builtin_denied_commands`,
`allowed_commands`) are dropped at `load()` and change nothing. If SH-10's panel gains a
write path that could shrink the view, the envelope belongs there.

**DISCOVERY (what the hash does and does not buy).** The digest catches on-disk
corruption, a partial write, and an edit that changed the patterns but not the digest —
those fail at import rather than shrinking the set. Because the fingerprint is held in
memory from import onward, it also catches a *self-consistent* rewrite of both the patterns
and the digest, which a naive "hash the file against its own field" check cannot see. It
does **not** stop the owner of the machine: anyone who can rewrite the installed package
before the process starts owns the baseline. Anti-drift and anti-LLM-tamper, not
anti-owner — as the amendment states.
