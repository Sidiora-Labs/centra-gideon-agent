# Plan: Security Legibility — Make the Strongest Story Checkable

**Status:** DONE 2026-07-22 (S1 disclosure surface + S2 public threat model) — deepened 2026-07-18
(initial PROPOSED 2026-07-18 from the pre-launch investigation & owner alignment review). Shipped:
core `SECURITY.md` (GitHub private vulnerability reporting, ack/fix-or-plan stated as expectations
not SLAs) and an app-bundle-scoped apps-repo `SECURITY.md`; `docs/security/limitations.md`,
owner-signed 2026-07-22; `docs/security/threat-model.md` (five trust boundaries, a 10-row
OWASP-Agentic-Top-10 table with per-row status, a "what we deliberately don't defend against"
section, and a verified-against-`main`@commit line); README Security section expanded. PVR is enabled
on BOTH repos. The soul guardrail held: **zero** code or in-product-copy changes — every
citation-drift finding was routed to SECURITY-HARDENING as a DISCOVERY. Owner task 3 (the threat
model renders on the site) is satisfied now that the website's `/docs` sync autogenerates a Security
section from `docs/security/`. Status corrected 2026-08-04 by code audit.

## Context (verified 2026-07-18)

Controls inventory (all existing, all documented internally in `docs/architecture/security.md`): 4 auth modes with loopback-forced `none`; app-scoped 1-hour tokens injected by the reverse proxy that strips owner credentials; 112 denied + 52 suspicious command patterns merged at read time; OS child sandbox with credential env denylist; one egress chokepoint (`net/`) with named policies + user host-policy layering; `fence_untrusted` content fencing; supply-chain scanner with clean/warning(consent)/dangerous(terminal) verdicts and the scanned-bytes==installed-bytes invariant; HMAC-chained SEL; single YOLO trust state with TTL; credential-excluding exports. Honest-limitation facts to publish: ACP-under-YOLO tool gating rides system-prompt framing, not rails (`task_modes.py`, documented internally); the app `network` permission is declaration-only (disclosed at install consent). Missing externally: `SECURITY.md` (neither repo), any public threat model, any OWASP mapping.

## Design

- **SECURITY.md (both repos, near-identical):** report privately via GitHub Security Advisories (the "Report a vulnerability" button — owner must enable it); supported-versions table (latest minor only, pre-1.0); response expectation ("acknowledge ≤7 days, fix-or-plan ≤30 for confirmed issues" — solo-maintainer-honest numbers); scope-in (RCE, auth bypass, sandbox/scanner/egress bypass, token leakage) / scope-out (self-YOLO footguns, issues requiring an already-compromised host, hardening *requests* → normal issues).
- **`docs/security/threat-model.md`:** trust-boundary diagram (owner ↔ agent ↔ tools; core ↔ apps; gateway ↔ channels/inbound; install pipeline ↔ sources) + the ASI mapping table (below) + honest-limitations section + "what we deliberately don't defend against" (physical access, compromised OS, the owner's own YOLO choices — each with rationale). Source material is an *editing* job from `security.md` + the security-and-guardrails learnings file; no new claims may be invented — every row cites its module.
- **ASI mapping table rows (control ↔ category ↔ code):** ASI01 goal hijack → fencing + approval modes + memory-recall framing (`security.py::fence_untrusted`, `dashboard/handlers/memory.py`); ASI02 tool misuse → deny/suspicious patterns + task modes + sandbox (`security.py`, `sandbox.py`); ASI03 identity/privilege → app-scoped tokens + proxy credential stripping + permission middleware (`dashboard/handlers/apps.py::api_app_proxy`, `token_auth.py`); ASI04 supply chain → quarantine/scan/verdict gate + integrity invariant (`supply_chain.py`, `apps/app_manager.py`); ASI05 code execution → command screening + OS sandbox + env denylist; ASI06 memory/context poisoning → fenced recall + propose-don't-write learning + temporary/incognito modes; ASI07 inter-agent comms → *forward-pointer to plans 41/24 discipline (fail-closed inbound, fencing at ingestion)*; ASI08 cascading failures → breakers/budgets (AUTONOMY-GUARDRAILS, mark "in progress" honestly until it lands); ASI09 trust exploitation → approval surfaces + expiring YOLO + consent-gated installs; ASI10 rogue agents → SEL audit + kill switches (+ incident flag once guardrails land).
- **README security section (3 sentences + links)** and cross-links from the Store's install-consent docs.

## Contracts & artifacts (doc-artifact plan — no code contracts; structures pinned)

- **Artifacts produced (exact paths):** `SECURITY.md` (both repos), `docs/security/limitations.md`, `docs/security/threat-model.md`, README "Security" section. No source code, no config, no schema.
- **The one structured format — the ASI mapping table** (`threat-model.md`): columns `| ASI category | control | code citation (file:path) | status |` where status ∈ {`enforced`, `in progress (plan N)`, `documented limitation`}. **A row may say `enforced` ONLY with a resolvable `file:path` citation** — this is the plan's anti-fabrication rail (a cheaper model cannot invent a control it can't cite). Every claim traces to `docs/architecture/security.md` or the security-and-guardrails learnings file — inventing capabilities is escalation trigger E1.
- **Conventions:** none beyond markdown; the honest-limitations wording is copy-sensitive (owner sign-off, owner task 2).
- **Integration points:** consumed by DISCOVERABILITY (36 republishes threat-model on the site) + OSS-OPERATIONS (37 links SECURITY.md). Feeds SECURITY-HARDENING (47) candidate list via DISCOVERY entries — never inline fixes.

## Task breakdown (executor-ready — run under [EXECUTION-PROTOCOL](EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md))

### Session 1 — Disclosure surface

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | Write SECURITY.md per Design (core repo), with the advisory-channel link, versions table, response expectations, scope-in/out lists | create `SECURITY.md` | all four sections present; zero invented capability claims (cross-check each against `docs/architecture/security.md`) |
| T1.2 | Apps-repo SECURITY.md: same disclosure channel; scope adjusted (app bundles, scanner interaction); links back to core | apps repo: create `SECURITY.md` | mirrors core process; app-specific scope stated |
| T1.3 | Honest-limitations section drafted (ACP-YOLO framing-not-rails with `task_modes.py` citation; `network` declaration-only with the install-consent context; both in the security doc's own internal voice — quote it, don't soften it) | `docs/security/limitations.md` (new dir) | both limitations stated with code citations; wording approved path flagged for owner review (owner task 2) |
| V1 | Validation: from a stranger's seat — repo page shows the security policy; the "Report a vulnerability" path works end to end (owner task 1 must be done first); every link in the three files resolves | — | walkthrough clean |

### Session 2 — The public threat model

| ID | Task | Files | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.1 | Trust-boundary section: enumerate the five boundaries with one paragraph + the crossing-controls list each (source: architecture docs only) | create `docs/security/threat-model.md` | five boundaries; every named control has a module citation |
| T2.2 | ASI mapping table exactly per Design rows, with status column (`enforced` / `in progress (plan N)` / `documented limitation`) — no row may claim `enforced` without a code citation | `docs/security/threat-model.md` | ten rows; citations resolve (spot-check by grep); in-progress rows name their plan |
| T2.3 | "What we deliberately don't defend against" + rationale paragraphs | `docs/security/threat-model.md` | section present; consistent with limitations.md |
| T2.4 | README "Security" section (3 sentences: posture, threat-model link, disclosure link); cross-link from `docs/architecture/security.md` header and third-party-install docs (apps repo) | `README.md`, `docs/architecture/security.md`, apps repo `docs/third-party-install.md` | links resolve both directions |
| V2 | Validation: read the full threat model as a skeptical outsider; every claim traceable to code or explicitly marked in-progress/limitation; DISCOVERY entries filed for any control gap noticed (→ SECURITY-HARDENING candidates), with zero inline fixes | — | ledger reflects the read-through |

## Owner tasks (real world)

1. **Enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting** on both repos (Settings → Code security → Private vulnerability reporting) — required before V1; ~2 min per repo.
2. **Review and sign off the honest-limitations wording** (T1.3) and the response-expectation numbers in SECURITY.md — these are public commitments in your name.
3. When DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH S2 lands, confirm the threat model page renders on the site (it becomes a marketing asset).

## Risks & open questions

- **Risk — claim drift:** the threat model can rot as controls evolve; mitigation: the doc carries a "verified against commit" line, and SECURITY-HARDENING S4's review re-verifies it. A CI freshness check is deliberately NOT added (docs-drift automation beyond the stability inventory is out of scope — ratchet only on observed rot).
- **Open:** publish response-time expectations as targets vs. commitments — default text says "expectations, not SLAs" explicitly; owner may harden it.

## Execution log

- [2026-07-21][staging] DONE: Staged plan 35. Read the plan, EXECUTION-PROTOCOL, and both sanctioned sources (`docs/architecture/security.md`, `docs/research/learnings/security-and-guardrails.md`). Confirmed target files absent (no `SECURITY.md` either repo; no `docs/security/`). Ran the anti-fabrication citation sweep against `src/gideon/`: **20 of 21 cited files + 17 of 18 cited symbols resolve.** Ready to write T1.1–T1.3 next.
- [2026-07-21][T2.2] DISCOVERY (source-doc drift, NOT a control gap → correct the citation, do not invent): the plan's ASI04 row and `security.md:101-111` cite `supply_chain.py::install_guarded` and a literal "scanned bytes == installed bytes" invariant. **Neither exists by that name.** The real, equivalent controls: the install gate is `apps/app_manager.py::install_app` (staged→`default_scanner.scan(staged)`→`Verdict.DANGEROUS` terminal at ~L340→consent for `warning`→`shutil.move` staged→live at ~L402); `supply_chain.py` exposes `SkillScanner.scan`/`scan_text`/`scan_dir` + `Verdict{CLEAN,WARNING,DANGEROUS}` + `TrustTier`. The byte-integrity property is realized by **quarantine-staging** (scan and install target the identical staged dir), not a named byte assertion. ACTION when T2.2 is written: cite `apps/app_manager.py::install_app` + `supply_chain.py::SkillScanner`/`Verdict`; phrase the integrity property as "scans the quarantined staged tree that is then moved into place." Also file a same-scope DISCOVERY that `docs/architecture/security.md:104` (`install_guarded`) is stale — flag for owner, do NOT edit security.md inline (out of this plan's scope; it's a source doc, and E4/copy-sensitivity applies).
- [2026-07-21][T2.2] DISCOVERY: `security.md:57,61` state "112 denied + 52 suspicious" command patterns; verify the live counts of `BUILTIN_DENIED_COMMAND_PATTERNS` / `SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS` at write time and cite the count as-measured rather than copying the doc's numbers (they may have drifted since the doc was written). **Verified 2026-07-22: live counts are exactly 112 / 52 — safe to cite as-is.**
- [2026-07-22][T1.1] DONE: core `SECURITY.md` — disclosure via GitHub private vulnerability reporting, 7-day ack / 30-day fix-or-plan expectations (not SLAs), latest-0.x-minor versions table, scope in/out lists. Every capability claim cross-checked against `docs/architecture/security.md`; zero invented claims. Links to architecture + threat-model docs.
- [2026-07-22][T1.2] DONE: apps-repo `SECURITY.md` — same private-advisory channel, app-bundle-adjusted scope (malicious bundle / scanner-evasion / under-declared manifest in scope; consented `warning` install out of scope, `dangerous` override in scope), routes platform-code issues back to core.
- [2026-07-22][T1.3] DONE: `docs/security/limitations.md` — both honest limitations in the architecture's own voice with code citations: (1) ACP-under-YOLO gates via system-prompt framing not rails (`task_modes.py:15-18` native hard-enforce vs ACP protocol path; quoted `security.md` Trust/YOLO section); (2) app `network` permission DECLARATION-ONLY (quoted `apps/permissions.py::can_use_network`). Owner sign-off received 2026-07-22 (owner task 2).
- [2026-07-22][V1] DONE: PVR enabled on BOTH repos via `gh api -X PUT .../private-vulnerability-reporting` (owner task 1 — confirmed `enabled:true` both). All internal links resolve (threat-model.md pending S2, lands same session); the `security.md#trust--yolo-state-trust_modepy` anchor slug computed + matched. `make lint` green. Session 1 complete.
- [2026-07-22][T2.1] DONE: `docs/security/threat-model.md` — five trust boundaries (owner↔agent↔tools · core↔apps · gateway↔channels/inbound · install-pipeline↔sources · system↔persisted/exported), every named control carrying a resolvable module citation. Carries a "verified against `main`@<commit>" line per the claim-drift mitigation.
- [2026-07-22][T2.2] DONE: 10-row ASI table with status column. Enforced rows (ASI01-06, 09, 10) each cite a grep-verified `file:path`; ASI07 → in progress (plans 41, 24), ASI08 → in progress (plan 9), ASI10 incident-flag → in progress (plan 9). Applied the T2.2 citation-drift fix: cited `apps/app_manager.py::install` (verified the real fn is `install()` at L296, NOT `install_app` — caught a second stale name during the write and corrected all 3 refs) + `supply_chain.py::SkillScanner`/`Verdict`; phrased the byte-integrity property as quarantine-staging (scanned tree == installed tree), not a named byte assertion. **V2 re-grep: all 16 enforced-row citations resolve.**
- [2026-07-22][T2.3] DONE: "What we deliberately don't defend against" — physical access, compromised host OS/account, owner's own YOLO choices, app outbound network (declaration-only); each with rationale, consistent with limitations.md.
- [2026-07-22][T2.4] DONE: README "Security" section expanded (posture + threat-model link + private-disclosure link); cross-links added into `docs/architecture/security.md` header (→ threat-model + limitations + SECURITY.md) and apps-repo `docs/third-party-install.md` scan-gate section (→ core threat model + apps SECURITY.md). Links resolve both directions.
- [2026-07-22][V2] DONE: read the full threat model as a skeptical outsider; every enforced claim traces to grep-verified code, every non-enforced row marked in-progress with its plan number. All internal links resolve across both repos. DISCOVERY ledger below carries the source-doc-drift findings (→ SECURITY-HARDENING candidates); ZERO inline fixes to `security.md`/code. `make lint` green. Session 2 complete — plan 35 doc surface fully written; only owner task 3 (confirm threat-model renders on the site when DISCOVERABILITY-LAUNCH S2 lands) remains, and it is not blocking.
- [2026-07-22][DISCOVERY→plan 47] For SECURITY-HARDENING's candidate list (NOT fixed here): (a) `docs/architecture/security.md:104` cites `install_guarded` (nonexistent) — the real gate is `apps/app_manager.py::install`; the source doc should be corrected. (b) The "scanned bytes == installed bytes" invariant is achieved by quarantine-staging convention, not a named/tested byte-equality assertion — candidate for a hardening test that makes the TOCTOU-closure explicit. (c) ASI08 (denial-of-wallet) and ASI07 (fail-closed inbound) are genuine unlanded controls, correctly owned by plans 9/41/24 — not gaps, just not-yet-built.
