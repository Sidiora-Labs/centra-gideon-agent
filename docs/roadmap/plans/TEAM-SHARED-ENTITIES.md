# TEAM-SHARED-ENTITIES

**Status:** DECOMPOSED — the executable work now lives in [`../atomic/TSE.md`](../atomic/TSE.md) as 5 atomic plan(s).

This plan was split because parts of it blocked on other plans, which forced it to sit half-done while other work ran. Each atom below its own file executes start-to-finish in one go; the dependency graph lives in [`../atomic/dag.json`](../atomic/dag.json).

The original design record is kept below — execution logs, measured findings and owner rulings are the reason this document still matters.

# Plan: Multi-Tenant Entity Readiness — The Harness as a Good Citizen of Shared Stores

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — Session 1 (username identity + author attribution) shipped 2026-07-28;
Session 2 (mine-vs-everyone filters) shipped 2026-07-28; Session 3 (contributor provenance +
owner-weighted ranking) shipped 2026-07-30 — §2.4 satisfied by inspection.
🔴 **Sessions 4-5 are UNGATED as of 2026-08-04 and not yet started.** Their stated prerequisite has
landed: AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE shipped `triggers.json` + the one service (`triggers/store.py`,
`triggers/service.py`, S87-S131) and `ScheduleService` was deleted at S112, so the "build one seam,
not four" condition is met. What §3 still needs, verified absent: `trigger` is NOT in
`PROVIDER_TYPES` (`apps/manifest.py`) and has no `TriggerTypeHandler`, there is no
`sdk/triggers.py`, and `triggers/models.py::Trigger` carries `created_by` but no `author` field for
§2.2's owner-only-arms filter. Rescoped 2026-07-14 — harness-side scope

---

## Research Integration

The research corpus (`team-shared-harness-research.md`) documents how the ecosystem's shared stores and multi-tenant services work; the harness deliberately implements only the **CLIENT side** of those patterns — it consumes shared stores well, it does not build them. The one pattern adopted directly: provenance on foreign-attributed content is **metadata, not instructions** — labeled in recall, fenced in prompts, never authoritative.

---

## Overview

Exactly one entity has a full storage-provider seam today — tasks (`tasks/provider.py TaskProvider` + `tasks/registry.py` routing; an external provider app works with zero core edits). Memory has a provider contract (`memory_providers/base.py`). Triggers get their seam after AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE unifies four stores into `triggers.json` behind one `TriggerService`. What none of these seams have is **multi-user tolerance**: no record carries a "who," so a provider returning records attributed to other people would have them silently treated as the owner's own — foreign tasks counted as the owner's work, foreign triggers armed and fired on this machine, foreign memories ranked as if the owner wrote them.

This plan closes that gap harness-side:

1. **A minimal owner identity.** First-boot onboarding asks for a **username** alongside the existing display name (`dashboard.user_name`). The username is the harness owner's identity string — an opaque, stable string used for attribution. (Eventually this can be provisioned by an SSO or enterprise login when tailored to a team; that is a provisioning change, not a schema change.)
2. **Optional attribution fields** on entity records — author/assignee/contributor strings that default to the owner's username. No identity class hierarchy, no delegation model, no id minting: records may carry a username that isn't mine, and the harness handles that sensibly.
3. **Per-entity tolerance semantics** (§2): tasks display and filter by assignee, triggers arm only the owner's, memory recall labels contributors and weights the owner's memories higher.
4. **The trigger-store provider seam** (§3) so an app can be a trigger source, plus **one proof-of-concept app** (§4) that registers triggers which autonomously fire a workflow, an automation, a prompt, and an action — validating the integration path end-to-end.

**Soul guardrail:** Gideon stays personal — one human, one home, plain local files. Every attribution field is optional and defaults to the owner; with no multi-tenant providers installed there is zero behavior change (a migration test proves a pre-plan store round-trips with only the new defaults). Execution never leaves the machine: whatever a store holds, this harness fires only what its owner created, under all local policy (capability allowlists, budgets, kill switch).

---

## 1. Owner Identity: a Username at First Boot (Session 1)

- **Onboarding** asks for a username alongside the display name (the existing `dashboard.user_name` "Operator Name" step in `web/src/app/Onboarding.tsx`). New config field `dashboard.username`: lowercase-ish opaque string, suggested from the display name, editable in Settings → Account (`AccountPanel.tsx`).
- **Config wiring** through all four points (the established checklist): `_meta(label, help)` on the field, `AppConfig.load()` explicit mapping, `to_dict()`, `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` allowlist + FE `api.ts` + panel.
- **Semantics:** the username is an attribution string, not a credential. Changing it is a rename that affects future writes only — existing records keep the string they were written with. Empty username (pre-existing installs that never re-onboard) degrades to today's behavior: writes carry no attribution and everything is treated as the owner's.
- **Attribution fields, everywhere cheap, defaulting to the owner** — all additive, plain strings:
  - `Task.author` / `Task.assignee` + `TaskComment.author` finally set (today an empty free string nobody fills).
  - Memory writes stamped with the owner's username (contributor field on the record).
  - Where schemas are still forming (AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's `triggers.json` rows, WORKFLOWS-V2 ledger/journal rows), **reserve optional author/contributor string fields** at design time — cheap now, breaking later. That is the entire footprint in other plans.
- **Future note (one line):** when tailored to a team, the username can be provisioned by SSO/enterprise login instead of first-boot entry.

---

## 2. Per-Entity Multi-User Tolerance Semantics (Sessions 2-3)

What "handles it sensibly" means, per entity:

### 2.1 Tasks (Session 2)

A multi-tenant `TaskProvider` may return tasks assigned to other users. The harness:

- **Displays assignee** on task rows/detail (username chip; owner's own tasks show no chip or "me").
- **Filters "mine vs everyone"** in task views (default: everyone visible, mine emphasized).
- **Never treats foreign tasks as the owner's work items:** Home widgets, ready-task counts, "next task" pickers, and any agent work-selection count and select **only tasks assigned to (or authored by, when unassigned) the owner**. A fixture multi-tenant provider in the test suite proves the counters.
- Writes through the registry stamp `author` (and default `assignee`) with the owner's username.

### 2.2 Triggers (Session 4, with the seam)

A shared trigger store may contain triggers created by others. The harness:

- **Arms and fires ONLY the owner's triggers** — the filter is `author == owner username` at arm time, enforced structurally in `TriggerService` (a foreign row cannot tick, not "is skipped").
- **Foreign triggers are visible and inert:** rendered read-only in the Automations surface (author chip, no enable/edit/delete), purely informational.
- Owner's triggers from a provider fire under all normal local policy — capability allowlists, budgets, kill switch. Provider-sourced display content (names, descriptions) entering prompts rides the existing `fence_untrusted` mechanism; nothing new.

### 2.3 Memory (Session 3)

A shared memory provider may return memories contributed by others. The harness:

- **Recall carries contributor provenance:** hits from other contributors are labeled (the same labeled-provenance rendering used for cross-project recall — labels are metadata, not instructions) and fenced on the way into prompts.
- **Ranking weights the owner's own memories higher:** at equal relevance, owner-contributed memories order above foreign-contributed ones; locality affects ordering only, never admission.
- **Writes attribute the owner's username** so anything this harness contributes to a shared store carries provenance for everyone else.

### 2.4 Knowledge (near-free rider, inside Session 3)

Where federated knowledge search hits already render a source label, a provider-supplied contributor rides that label unchanged — string passthrough, no new machinery. Nothing further.

---

## 3. The Trigger-Store Provider Seam (Session 4, core — gated)

Gated on AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE steps 1-3 (`triggers.json` + one `TriggerService`), per the audit's difficulty ordering — otherwise we'd build four seams and throw three away.

- Extract a **`TriggerStore` interface** from the unified service's persistence (list/get/upsert/delete + change-notification); native impl wraps `triggers.json` with all its preserved conventions (fcntl, mtime-sync, atomic_write).
- New provider type **`trigger`** enters `PROVIDER_TYPES` (apps/manifest.py) **and** a `TriggerTypeHandler` in providers/registry.py **in the same commit** — `test_manifest_types_match_handlers` guards the known bug class.
- A trigger provider contributes **trigger rows, never execution** — the local `TriggerService` does all firing, and only for rows whose `author` is the owner (§2.2).
- SDK: `sdk/triggers.py` re-exports the store/provider contracts so third-party trigger sources are buildable like any provider app.

---

## 4. Proof-of-Concept Trigger-Provider App (Session 5, app)

One simple app (apps repo or third-party-apps/) that validates the integration path end-to-end — deliberately not a product:

- Registers as a `trigger` provider and contributes trigger rows to the harness.
- Its owner-authored triggers **autonomously fire** each of: a workflow, an automation, a prompt, and an action — proving an app-registered trigger can drive every action kind on the harness under local policy.
- Ships fixture rows under a second username ("alice") to prove the visible-but-inert rendering and the structural cannot-arm filter.
- Install is manifest-only (zero core edits) — the same bar the tasks seam already meets.

---

## Provider & Config Plug-in Map

- **Providers:** tasks use the existing `TaskTypeHandler` (zero core edits — the proof the pattern works); memory uses the existing `memory` type; triggers get the NEW type `trigger` + handler in the same commit (§3).
- **SDK:** `sdk/triggers.py` (TriggerStore/provider contracts) re-exported for third-party apps, `SDK_VERSION` conventions as with `sdk/sync.py`.
- **Config:** `dashboard.username` wired through the four points (§1). Anything provider-specific (backend URL, credentials) lives in per-app `ProviderSettings` + the credential store — NOT core config.
- **Untrusted content:** foreign-attributed content enters prompts only through the existing `fence_untrusted` with a provenance source; no new screening machinery.
- **Egress/secrets:** provider apps follow the standing app-platform rules (`net.fetch` under the CONNECTOR profile, `save_credential`); nothing new here.

---

## Implementation Effort

**~5 sessions** (4 core, 1 app).

| # | Side | Session | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | core | Username at first boot (onboarding + AccountPanel + four-point config wiring) + attribution fields defaulting to owner (`Task.author`/`assignee`, `TaskComment.author`, memory-write contributor) + reserve optional author/contributor strings in still-forming schemas (triggers.json, v2 ledger rows) + invisible-single-user migration test | nothing (Wave 0) |
| 2 | core | Task multi-user tolerance: assignee display, mine-vs-everyone filter, MINE-only Home widgets/ready-task counts/work-selection, fixture multi-tenant provider in tests | Session 1 |
| 3 | core | Memory contributor provenance: labeled + fenced recall, owner-weighted ranking, attributed writes; knowledge federated-hit contributor label passthrough (near-free) | Session 1 |
| 4 | core | `TriggerStore` seam + provider type `trigger` (+handler, same commit) + owner-filter at arm time + foreign-trigger read-only rendering | AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE steps 1-3 (Wave 3) |
| 5 | app | Proof-of-concept trigger-provider app: owner triggers autonomously fire a workflow / automation / prompt / action; second-username fixtures prove inert display + cannot-arm | Session 4 |

Sessions 1-3 are Wave 0 (no dependencies, ship value alone); Sessions 4-5 are Wave 3, after the substrate's trigger unification.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Attribution fields ripple into stores and break single-user installs | All fields optional + defaulting to the owner's username; migration round-trip test; Session 1 gated on zero behavior change in the full regression suite |
| A foreign trigger fires on this harness | Owner-filter enforced structurally in `TriggerService` at arm time (a foreign row cannot tick); adversarial test with a provider whose rows are majority-foreign |
| Foreign tasks pollute the owner's work signals | MINE-only counters/pickers proven against the fixture multi-tenant provider (Home widgets, ready counts, agent work-selection) |
| A foreign memory steers prompts | Provenance labels are metadata + `fence_untrusted` on the way in; ranking down-weights, never admits-by-authority; adversarial "ignore prior instructions" test |
| Username rename orphans attribution | Username is an opaque stable string; rename affects future writes only, old records keep their string — documented, tested |
| Trigger seam built before the substrate unifies (four seams instead of one) | Session 4 hard-gated on AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE steps 1-3 |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Invisible single-user:** with no multi-tenant providers installed, the full regression suite and a byte-level store round-trip show zero behavior change after Sessions 1-3 — every new field silently defaults to the owner's username.
2. **Identity lands:** first boot asks for a username beside the display name; it persists in `config.json`, is editable in Settings → Account, and stamps subsequent task/comment/memory writes.
3. **Task tolerance:** a fixture `TaskProvider` returning tasks assigned to "alice" and "bob" renders assignees correctly, the mine-vs-everyone filter works, and Home widgets/ready-task counts/agent work-selection count only the owner's tasks.
4. **Trigger tolerance:** a trigger provider containing another username's triggers shows them read-only and structurally cannot arm them (test at the `TriggerService` seam, not the UI); the owner's triggers from the same provider arm and fire normally.
5. **PoC end-to-end:** the proof-of-concept app installs manifest-only with zero core edits, registers triggers on the harness, and each owner-authored trigger autonomously fires its workflow/automation/prompt/action under local policy.
6. **Memory tolerance:** recall over a shared-provider fixture returns foreign memories labeled with their contributor and fenced (a hit whose text says "ignore prior instructions" steers nothing); at equal relevance the owner's memories rank first; writes carry the owner's username.

## Execution log

- [2026-07-28][S1] DONE (§1 — owner identity + attribution): new `identity.py` + `dashboard.username` + task/comment attribution. (a) **The slug rule (OWNER RULING, 2026-07-28: strict slug).** `slugify_username()`: NFKD-fold accents → lowercase → `[a-z0-9_-]` (everything else → `-`) → collapse repeats → trim separators → cap 32 chars → re-trim. `"Keyur Golani"` → `keyur-golani`, `"José"` → `jose`, `"a@b.com"` → `a-b-com`. Strict on purpose: this string lands in JSON records (and later shard filenames + sync payloads) effectively forever, so a permissive rule would bake trailing spaces/emoji/full email addresses into records nobody can rename. Unusable input yields `""` — never a fabricated `user-1`. Normalization runs at BOTH the write boundary and on config LOAD, so a hand-edited `config.json` can't smuggle a non-canonical handle into records. (b) **Config 4-point wiring** — `DashboardConfig.username` + `_meta`, `AppConfig.load()` (via `_slug_username`), `to_dict` (asdict), and the PUT handler write+read. (c) **Attribution** — `Task.author` (NEW field; see the correction below) stamped from `current_username()` at create, explicit author wins; `TaskComment.author` now prefers the handle over the historical `"user"` placeholder (which remains the fallback so existing readers see no change). (d) **FE** — Settings → Account gained a Username field (placeholder suggests the slug of the display name; shows the SERVER's canonical value after save, so typing `"  Typed  MESSY Name!!  "` visibly becomes `typed-messy-name`), using the shared `Button` primitive. (e) **Semantics, tested:** a rename affects FUTURE writes only — rewriting history to match a new handle would falsify the very record attribution exists to preserve; empty handle = no attribution = today's behavior; `current_username()` never raises (attribution decorates a write and must not be why one fails). 31 tests in `test_identity.py`.
- [2026-07-28][S1] PREMISE CORRECTION (E1, confirmed): the plan states at §1 that "`Task.author` / `Task.assignee` + `TaskComment.author` **finally set** (today an empty free string nobody fills)" — true for `assignee` and `TaskComment.author`, but **`Task.author` did not exist** (`tasks/models.py`: `assignee` only). Added additively with a `""` default per AGENTS.md ("stay additive: defaults on new fields, tolerant reads"), so pre-attribution task JSON loads cleanly with `author == ""` (regression-tested).
- [2026-07-28][S1] TWO BUGS FOUND BY TESTING/VALIDATION, both fixed: (1) **`Task.from_dict` builds the dataclass field-by-field**, so `author` was silently DROPPED on every read — the round-trip test caught it (a task created with an author read back as `""`); added to the constructor call. (2) **The `PUT /api/dashboard/config` handler carries its OWN field allowlist**, separate from the dataclass — so after all four config wiring points were correct, the endpoint still 400'd `Unknown fields: {'username'}`. Only driving the real endpoint caught this; both now have regression tests (the second asserts the allowlist by source-grep, since a unit test on the dataclass can't see it).
- [2026-07-28][S1] SCOPE TRIMS (logged, not silent): (a) the plan's "**reserve optional author/contributor string fields** in AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE's `triggers.json` rows and WORKFLOWS-V2 ledger/journal rows" is **unstartable** — neither store exists (`triggers.json` appears nowhere in `src/`; there is no v2 ledger). The plan itself calls that "the entire footprint in other plans", so it is dropped rather than faked; those plans should add the field when they create those rows. (b) The **memory-write contributor stamp** is deferred to MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT S1, which is already extending `vector_memory.py`'s `_MIGRATIONS` ladder to v7 (owner-approved) — adding a `contributor` column here would mean two separate schema touches on the same table in the same sprint. Doing it there is one migration instead of two.
- [2026-07-28][S1] Gate: `make lint` green (519 files) · `make test` **8345 passed (50.6s)** · web typecheck + 251 vitest + build green. The primitive-adoption ratchet tripped on my Save button and was fixed by ADOPTING `Button` (the two older Save buttons in that panel remain hand-rolled — pre-existing, not touched), never a baseline bump. NOTE: one intermediate suite run showed 157s + a `TestOnDoneTimeout` failure; that was contention from a concurrent web build, confirmed by isolating the test (8.2s, 6 passed) and re-running the suite alone (50.6s green) — same false alarm pattern as the CE-S5 lesson. Validated as-a-user on :10025: messy handle normalized + persisted to config.json, non-string rejected 400, task author + comment author stamped, rename kept the old record's author while the new one got the new handle, Settings → Account round-trips through the real endpoint, zero console errors. **Remaining: S2** (task mine-vs-everyone filters + MINE-only counters), **S3** (memory contributor provenance + owner-weighted ranking — inherits the deferred stamp above); S4-S5 gate on AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE.

### 2026-07-28 — Session 2 (§2.1 tasks: mine vs everyone) — DONE

`Task.belongs_to(username)` + an owner-only default on `ready_tasks` + a `mine`
filter on the list endpoint + attribution in the shared task meta line.

**The load-bearing guarantee, and where it lives.** §2.1 requires that Home widgets,
ready counts, "next task" pickers, and agent work-selection count and select only the
owner's tasks. All of those already funnel through `registry.ready_tasks` — the ready
endpoint and the agent's `task_ready` tool are its only callers — so the filter went
THERE with `mine_only=True` as the default, rather than at each surface. A surface
that forgets to filter is the failure mode; with the default inverted, a surface has
to explicitly ask for everyone's work to see it.

**Readiness is still computed over the FULL task set, then filtered.** A task of mine
blocked by a colleague's unfinished prerequisite is genuinely not startable, and
filtering before reconciliation would report it as ready. Test-locked
(`test_readiness_is_computed_over_the_full_set`).

**Ownership semantics** (`belongs_to`): assignee decides when set — who DOES it beats
who wrote it, in both directions — and an unassigned task falls back to its author,
because "I wrote it and nobody picked it up" is still my work. Two deliberate
"everything is mine" cases: an **unattributed** task (no author, no assignee) belongs
to the owner, because every task written before attribution existed looks like that
and treating them as foreign would empty the counters on upgrade; and with **no
username configured** every task is the owner's, which is both today's behavior and
the honest answer — with no identity there is nobody else for a task to belong to.

**Surfaces.** `GET /api/tasks?mine=1` resolves the owner server-side rather than
taking a name from the client, and means "assigned to me, or authored by me and
unassigned" — which the pre-existing `assignee=` filter cannot express. `total` is
recomputed for the filtered set (otherwise the UI reads "1 of 2" over a one-row list),
and every response now carries `owner` so the frontend can label rows. `GET
/api/tasks/ready?everyone=1` is the opt-in shared-board view.

**FE.** The mine/everyone control is a `FilterMenu` section that **only appears when
someone else's work is actually present** — on a single-user install it could only
ever be a no-op, and a control that does nothing is worse than no control. Attribution
was added to `MetaLine`, which the list row and the card both render, so one edit
covers both views; the list row previously showed no assignee at all, which is a real
gap on a shared board. It renders only when someone is named, since "@you" on every
row of a solo install is noise.

Tests: `tests/test_task_ownership.py`, 16 cases. Validated as a user on an isolated
dev home with a mixed board (mine / Dana's / unassigned): writes stamped the author
automatically, `mine=1` returned 2 of 3, and `/api/tasks/ready` excluded Dana's task
while `?everyone=1` returned all three. Full suite 8696 passed; lint clean; web
typecheck + 268 vitest green. **Remaining: Session 3** (§2.3 memory contributor
provenance + owner-weighted ranking, §2.4 knowledge label passthrough) and Sessions
4-5 (the trigger-store provider seam, gated).

### 2026-07-30 — Session 3 (§2.3 memory contributor provenance + owner-weighted ranking) — DONE

Migration **v9** adds `contributor` to both record tables, stamped at the single INSERT of
each; recall labels foreign records and fences the label as metadata; ranking prefers the
owner's own memories in ORDER only. §2.4 is satisfied by inspection (below).

**The deferred stamp had fallen through TWICE and this session owns it.** S1's log deferred
the memory contributor stamp to MEMORY-GRAPH-AND-VAULT S1 ("one migration instead of two");
that plan's S1 log then re-deferred it to its own §4.2 (Session 3, unbuilt) as "dead schema
nothing reads". Both deferrals were individually reasonable and the net effect was a
capability owned by nobody. Verified before starting: no `contributor` column existed on
either table. It lands here, where there is finally a reader for it.

**One stamp site, not nine.** `_write_semantic`'s upsert is the ONLY statement that creates
a `semantic_memory` row, and `write_episodic`'s INSERT the only one for episodes — so both
stamps cover every typed writer (`put`, `write_lesson`, facets, consolidation, promotion,
migration, import) plus the HTTP endpoint, and no future writer can forget. Verified by
driving `write_lesson` and the PUT endpoint, not by reading call sites.

**A caller cannot spoof a contributor.** `PUT /api/memory/semantic` reads four named keys
and silently drops the rest, so a `contributor` in the body never reaches the store; the
server stamps `current_username()`. Confirmed live — posting `"contributor":"dana"` stored
`keyur-golani`. The keyword-only override on `set_semantic` exists for internal callers
(import) only.

**`contributor` is NOT in the ON CONFLICT update.** Editing a shared record is not authoring
it. Reassigning on every touch would make the column mean "last writer" while claiming to
mean "contributor" — worse than no column. Test-locked: the owner edits Dana's record, the
value changes, the attribution does not.

**Ordering only, never admission — and where that boundary physically lives.** The owner
bonus is applied in the SORT KEY, deliberately not added to `score`, because `score > 0` is
the admission gate: a provenance bonus ahead of it could lift a zero-relevance record into
the result set, letting locality decide what the model SEES. Three tests pin the boundary
from both sides — owner wins a tie, a zero-relevance owner record is still excluded, and a
stronger foreign match still beats a weaker owner one. `_OWNER_RANK_BONUS = 0.05` sits under
one keyword-overlap step (0.1 after normalization), following the heat boost's
bounded-nudge precedent rather than the graph arm's deliberately-admitting one.
Also verified live that a *better-matching* foreign record correctly outranks the owner's.

**A REAL BUG I INTRODUCED AND THE SUITE CAUGHT — restore from any older snapshot silently
imported NOTHING.** `_MERGE_ALLOWED_TABLES` names columns explicitly; adding `contributor`
unconditionally meant a pre-v9 snapshot raised `no such column`, the handler logged and
SKIPPED the table, and the restore printed "Semantic Memory imported: 0" while looking like
it succeeded. Losing all memory on restore is far worse than losing a provenance column, so
the column is now opportunistic via `_both_have()` (checks BOTH databases). Verified both
directions: v9→v9 imports 6 semantic + 1 episodic with contributors intact; pre-v9→v9
imports cleanly with an empty contributor.

**Two other explicit allowlists that would have silently dropped provenance:** the vault
frontmatter emitter (`_FM_ORDER`) and the snapshot merge column lists. Both are now covered
by tests that assert the allowlist itself, since a unit test on the column can't see them.

**Three episodic READ paths omitted the column** (vector search, list, FTS search), so the
stamp landed but never reached recall. Found by asserting on `recall_with_provenance`'s
output rather than on the stored row — the stamp test passed while the feature didn't work.

**Fence budget:** the "(from …) is metadata" clause is added ONLY when a label is actually
present. The fence is paid on every injected turn, and `test_respects_cap` correctly caught
the unconditional version inflating the header by 315 chars. Content capping was never
wrong (476 ≤ 500) — the fence was.

**§2.4 (knowledge label passthrough) — SATISFIED BY INSPECTION, no code.** The section reads
"*Where* federated knowledge search hits already render a source label, a provider-supplied
contributor rides that label unchanged — string passthrough, no new machinery. Nothing
further." That condition is already met: `provider` is an opaque string set at ingest
(`knowledge/store.py:239`), defaulted on read (`store.py:963`), carried verbatim onto search
hits (`knowledge/retrieval.py:154`) and context cards (`handlers/knowledge.py:1186`), and
rendered as a pill (`KnowledgeDetail.tsx:367`, `KnowledgeListPage.tsx:645`).
`KnowledgeItem.metadata` is a second open carrier. A provider expressing a contributor works
today. Making it a *separately rendered token* would be new machinery, which §2.4 explicitly
forecloses — so nothing was built, deliberately.

**Upgrade safety:** existing rows are NOT back-stamped (no backfill) — a pre-column record
has genuinely unknown authorship, and inventing the current owner would falsify exactly what
the column exists to preserve, the same rule `identity.py` states for renames. An
unattributed record counts as the owner's for ranking, and with no username configured the
bonus is uniform, so a single-user install orders exactly as it does today (test-locked).

**Import preserves foreign provenance.** A record carrying a contributor keeps it; stamping
the importer would relabel a colleague's memory as the importer's own. Verified live through
`POST /api/memory/import`.

**Product surface:** `GET /api/memory/semantic` gains `contributor` (automatic — it
pass-throughs the row) plus a server-resolved `is_mine` flag, so the "is this mine?" rule
lives in one place instead of being re-derived in the client; the Memory Studio inspector
shows `Contributor: you | <handle>`.

**Validated as a user** on an isolated dev home with a mixed store (owner + an imported
"dana"): server stamping; spoof attempt stored the real owner; import preserved `dana`;
recall labeled the foreign record and episode with the metadata-not-instructions fence;
symmetric-key tie ordered the owner first while a better-matching foreign record correctly
won; snapshot→restore(replace) preserved both contributors; the inspector rendered
`Contributor: dana` and `Contributor: you`. **0 console errors, 0 gateway tracebacks.** (The
owner's real gateway on :10000 was left untouched; the CLI's gateway-running guard is global,
so the merge paths were exercised by calling `_merge_memory` directly.)

**Gates:** `make lint` clean (mypy 551 files) · backend **9118 passed** · web **283 passed**
+ typecheck + build. Tests: `tests/test_memory_contributor.py`, 38 cases.

**Remaining:** Sessions 4-5 (the trigger-store provider seam + a proof-of-concept trigger
provider app), still gated on AUTOMATION-SUBSTRATE steps 1-3 — `triggers.json` and
`TriggerService` do not exist yet.

### 2026-08-18 — Session 4 / `TSE-4` (§2.2 + §3: the trigger-store seam) — DONE

`TriggerStoreProvider` (the interface §3 calls `TriggerStore`) + the `trigger` provider
type and its handler in one commit + `Trigger.author` + the structural owner filter +
`sdk/triggers.py` + foreign-trigger read-only rendering.

**`trigger` is NOT `trigger_source`, and the code says so.** The precedent AUTO-A4 shipped
contributes the STIMULUS: a live observer with `start`/`stop` pushing typed events onto the
bus, which the owner's own `kind: event` rows match. This type contributes the RULE: a
passive store of trigger DEFINITIONS. Push vs pull, events vs rows, machinery-with-a-
lifecycle vs persistence-with-a-change-notification. One app may register as both, and a
provider-served row may be bound to a provider-emitted event — which is what collapsing the
two would make unsayable. Stated in `triggers/provider.py`'s module docstring, in
`TriggerTypeHandler`'s, and beside the `PROVIDER_TYPES` entry, because they now sit adjacent.

**The extraction's shape.** The native impl already existed and keeps its name
(`triggers.store.TriggerStore`, ~30 importers across the gateway and CLI); what was missing
was the abstraction, so `provider.TriggerStoreProvider` is an ABC of exactly §3's list
(`load`/`list_triggers`/`get`/`upsert`/`delete` + `changed_on_disk` as the change-notify, plus
`base_dir` because `service.tick` roots the claim store from it) and `TriggerStore` now
subclasses it. The interface is named `…Provider` to match every other app-facing contract
(`TriggerSourceProvider`, `SyncTransportProvider`, `SandboxProvider`) rather than renaming a
class 30 call sites point at.

**The owner filter is structural, and the mutation proves it prevents rather than hides.**
`provider.armable(store)` is the arm path's ONE row source: it drops broken rows and rows
`author != owner` before returning, so a foreign row is never in the candidate set. It replaced
the `for row in store.load(): … row.ok` idiom at all SEVEN arm/fire selection sites —
`service.tick`, `service.boot`, and the `file`/`idle`/`web_watch`/`view` poll loops plus both
`chain` lookups — which is a consolidation, not a bolt-on (each site had re-derived the `ok`
check). Falsified by deleting only the ownership half of `armable`: the foreign row then
produced a real `DueFire(reason='due')` from `tick` and a real `rearmed` entry from `boot`.
Both poll-loop and chain assertions reddened in the same run.

**Unattributed reads as the owner's — deliberately, and local creates are NOT stamped.**
`author=""` is what every pre-existing row has and what a provider that declines to attribute
sends; both mean "nobody else claims this", matching `Task.belongs_to` and
`identity.current_username`'s "empty degrades to today's behavior". Handled in ONE place
(`parse_trigger`, lowercased/stripped at the boundary) — a clean break with no migration and no
dual read, because an optional field has no old shape, only an unattributed one. DEVIATION
from the §2.1 tasks precedent: local writes do **not** stamp the owner's username onto new
rows. `identity`'s own second semantic is that a rename affects future writes only and existing
records keep their string — so stamping would make a username change turn every existing
automation foreign and silently stop it. A provider attributes; core does not.

**Rendered before armed, and the gap is named.** A registered provider's rows join the LISTING
read (`provider.all_rows`, used by the Automations endpoint) but not `armable`. The arm path
PERSISTS — `tick` writes `next_fire_at`/`run_count`/health back through `store.upsert` — and
`store` there is the native one, so arming a provider's row would either duplicate it into
`triggers.json` under one id or leave `next_fire_at` frozen, which is due-again-every-tick, a
fire storm. Routing a write back to the store that served a row is TSE-5's precondition
("owner triggers autonomously fire") and is the one piece this session did not build.

**Read-only rendering.** `read_only` is computed SERVER-side from the same
`ownership.is_owner_authored` the arm path uses and passed through, never re-derived in the UI
from `author` — two opinions about who owns a trigger would drift. A foreign row loses Edit from
its context menu, gains an author chip, and its inspector shows enabled STATE as text with no
toggle and no Run now / Dry run / Delete at all (absent, not `disabled`: a greyed control still
asserts the action could apply). Mutating a provider-served row is structurally impossible
anyway — the mutation routes read the native store's `get()`, which never sees it, so they 404.
**Known gap, stated plainly:** a locally-STORED row attributed to somebody else (e.g. arriving
via a synced `triggers.json`) renders read-only but the mutation endpoints would still accept a
write. Nothing produces that shape today; closing it means an ownership refusal in the store
handler's six mutation branches.

**Two same-commit obligations found by the gates, both real.** (1) `src/gideon/reference/
providers.md` regenerated with `python -m gideon.manifest_reference` (byte-checked by
`test_agent_reference`; falsified — dropping the type reddens it). Note the path: the reference
ships inside the package, not under `docs/`. (2) `cli_app_new._sdk_module_candidates` gained the
PLURAL candidate: `trigger` publishes its contract in `sdk/triggers.py`, which the singular-only
ladder could not resolve, so the scaffold emitted a duck-typed stub with no `load` and
`TriggerTypeHandler` refused to register it — `test_app_scaffold` caught it. `sdk/triggers.py` is
the only plural module on the boundary, verified across all 19 types: one resolution added, none
changed. No capability class was needed (that obligation belongs to `action` providers).

**The inert-surface ratchet was satisfied by adding consumers, never by regenerating.** The five
new `sdk/triggers.py` `__all__` symbols counted as inert because the census looks for
`from gideon.sdk… import <name>` outside the facade, and importing the module by name does
not count. Fixed by writing the SDK test in the exact import form an app uses.

**Falsifications** (each applied live, `ast.parse`-checked, restored from a file copy):
ownership half of `armable` removed → `tick` fires the foreign row; handler registration removed
→ `#47` rail reds with `declarable_no_handler: ['trigger']`; `trigger` removed from
`PROVIDER_TYPES` → same rail reds with `handler_not_declarable: ['trigger']` AND the reference
rail reds; `"author"` dropped from `Trigger.to_dict` → the round-trip and old-shape tests red.

**Gate:** `make lint` green (black 1776 files, isort, flake8, mypy 913 files) · `make test`
**22101 passed, 30 skipped, 12 xfailed** · web `npm ci` + typecheck + **4024 tests / 397 files**
+ build all green. Tests: `tests/test_triggers_ownership.py` (25 cases) and
`web/src/pages/triggers/foreignTriggerReadOnly.test.tsx` (6 cases).

**Remaining:** `TSE-5` (the proof-of-concept trigger-provider app), which additionally needs the
write-back routing described above before an app-served row can autonomously fire.
