# CLI reference

The `gideon` command is the single entry point (installed by
`pip install -e .` via the `gideon` console script; source:
`src/gideon/cli.py`). Run `gideon <command> --help` for the live help
text — this page mirrors it.

## Global options

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--version` | Print the version and exit. |
| `-v` / `--verbose` | Increase log verbosity (`-v` INFO, `-vv` DEBUG). Overrides the persisted `agent.log_level`. |

Commands that talk to a running gateway (`status`, `stop`, `restart`, `token`,
`logout`, `spawn`) accept `--port` (default: resolved from the `GIDEON_PORT`
env var or the `dashboard.url` config).

## `gideon gateway`

Start the Gideon server (dashboard + channels). This is the long-running
process everything else talks to.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--headless` | Serve channels only; skip the dashboard web server and SSH tunnel instructions. |
| `--no-crons` | Skip the cron scheduler — use when another instance handles cron execution. |
| `--no-open` | Do not auto-open the dashboard URL in the browser on startup. |
| `--port PORT` | Override the dashboard port — an integer, or `auto` for an OS-assigned ephemeral port. Falls back to config when omitted. |
| `--json-ready` | Print one `GIDEON_READY:{...}` line (port, token, pid, home) once bound — for test harnesses. The token grants access for up to 20 hours; treat captured stdout as sensitive. |
| `--approval {reads,yolo,interactive}` | Default tool-approval mode. `reads` auto-approves read-only tools; `yolo` auto-approves everything (refused unless `GIDEON_HOME` is explicitly non-default); `interactive` uses the prompt flow. |
| `--test-mode` | Convenience bundle: `--port auto --no-open --json-ready --approval reads` (explicit `--port`/`--approval` win). |
| `--seed FIXTURE` | Dev tool: populate `$GIDEON_HOME` from a named fixture (under `tests_fixtures/`) before starting. Refuses the main gateway home (`~/.gideon`) and non-empty targets. |
| `--seed-replace` | With `--seed`, wipe `$GIDEON_HOME` before copying. Never overrides the main-home rail. |

Two fixtures ship:

| Fixture | Contents |
|---|---|
| `empty` | A bare home — just the `fixture.yaml` marker. Everything else is created on first boot. |
| `demo-home` | A home that looks used, for screenshots and demos: two projects with briefs, three task lists, ten tasks spanning every status (one blocked on a real dependency), markdown memory (preferences, project context, two days of history), five knowledge docs, and one completed loop with a three-phase plan. Onboarding is pre-completed, so it boots straight to the dashboard. Semantic/episodic memory *records* are still not included — that store is SQLite-only with no text tier, unlike the markdown memory the fixture does carry. |

## `gideon chat`

Chat with the agent from the terminal.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(no flags)* | Interactive chat mode. |
| `-m, --message TEXT` | Send a single message non-interactively. |
| `--model NAME` | Model to use for this run (default: the configured chat binding). |

## `gideon setup`

Install agent config and configure credentials (interactive wizard).

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--agent-only` | Only install agent config; skip credential prompts. |
| `--clean` | Fresh install — don't merge MCP servers/tools from existing config. |
| `--mode {docker,service,none}` | Deployment mode: Docker Compose, system service (systemd/launchd), or none. |
| `--provider NAME` | Set the default chat provider by registry entry name. |
| `--credential NAME[=VALUE]` | Store a named credential (value from the argument or an env var). |

## `gideon doctor`

Verify the Gideon setup (credentials, model bindings, channel tokens,
directories). No flags.

## Gateway lifecycle

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gideon status [--port]` | Show runtime stats from the running gateway. |
| `gideon stop [--port]` | Stop a running gateway. |
| `gideon restart [--port]` | Restart the gateway (service if installed, else foreground). |
| `gideon logs [-f] [-n LINES]` | Show gateway logs (`-f` live tail; `-n` line count, default 100). Reads the systemd journal (Linux service), launchd stdout file (macOS), or the foreground log file. |
| `gideon token [--port] [--ttl 20h]` | Print a dashboard access URL with a fresh auth token (`--ttl` e.g. `1h`, `30m`). |
| `gideon logout [--port]` | Revoke all active dashboard sessions. |
| `gideon update` | Update Gideon to the latest version (git fetch + rebuild). |

## `gideon service`

Manage the gateway as a system service — systemd unit on Linux
(`/etc/systemd/system/`, requires sudo) or launchd LaunchAgent on macOS
(`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, no sudo). Survives SSH disconnect, auto-restarts on
crash, auto-starts on boot.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `service install` | Install and start the gateway service. |
| `service uninstall` | Stop and remove the gateway service. |
| `service status` | Show service status (systemctl/launchctl). |

## `gideon cron`

Manage scheduled jobs.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cron list` | List cron jobs. |
| `cron add NAME MESSAGE [--every SECS] [--cron EXPR] [--channel ID] [--approval-mode auto]` | Add a job — interval (`--every`) or cron expression (`--cron "0 9 * * MON-FRI"`); optionally post results to a channel; `--approval-mode auto` auto-approves the job's tools. |
| `cron update JOB_ID [--name] [--message] [--every SECS] [--cron EXPR] [--channel ID] [--approval-mode auto\|default]` | Update a job (`default` resets approval mode). |
| `cron remove JOB_ID` | Remove a job. |
| `cron pause JOB_ID` / `cron resume JOB_ID` | Pause / resume a job. |
| `cron trigger JOB_ID` | Fire a job immediately. |

## `gideon spawn`

Manage background subagents.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `spawn run TASK [--async]` | Spawn a subagent; waits for the result unless `--async` (fire-and-forget). |
| `spawn list` | List active subagents. |

## `gideon learn`

Save or manage learned corrections.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `learn add RULE [--category tool\|preference\|knowledge] [--negative TEXT]` | Save a lesson (default category `knowledge`; `--negative` records what NOT to do). |
| `learn list` | List all lessons. |
| `learn remove QUERY` | Remove lessons whose rule matches a substring. |

## `gideon memory`

Manage the vector memory system.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `memory list` | Show semantic memory entries. |
| `memory search QUERY` | Search episodic memories. |
| `memory stats` | Show memory statistics. |
| `memory audit` | Scan memory for suspicious content. |
| `memory export [-o FILE]` | Export all memory to JSON (default: stdout). |
| `memory import FILE` | Import memory from a JSON export. |
| `memory migrate` | Migrate legacy markdown memory to the vector store. |

## `gideon agent`

Manage agent definitions.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `agent list` | List agents. |
| `agent create --name NAME [--provider-agent NAME] [--default-dir PATH] [--memory-store NAME]` | Create an agent. |
| `agent update NAME [--provider-agent] [--default-dir] [--memory-store]` | Update an agent. |
| `agent delete NAME` | Delete an agent. |

## `gideon app`

Scaffold a third-party app.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `app new --list-types` | Print the provider types this build accepts, derived at runtime from the provider registry — plus the SDK contract each type's stub implements and how many providers of that type are registered. A type added upstream shows up here without a scaffold change. |
| `app new NAME --type TYPE [--dir DIR] [--display-name] [--description] [--author] [--force]` | Generate an installable app: `app.json` (validated against core's own manifest parser, with the plan-32 `cli.*` seams and `loggerRoots`), a provider stub implementing that type's SDK ABC, a passing `test_provider.py`, `README.md`, and an MIT `LICENSE`. Declares no permissions — add only what the provider uses. |
| `app new --from-template [--dir DIR] [--template-url URL] [--template-archive FILE] [--force]` | Fork-and-go: fetch the [`gideon/app-template`](https://github.com/gideon/app-template) repo into `DIR/app-template` instead of generating. Same `--type tool` output, plus CI and a clone-to-installed README. Takes no NAME — renaming is a documented four-edit step in the template's README; use `--type` to generate a named app. |

Names are kebab-case. `pytest <dir>` passes on the generated bundle as-generated, and
installing it from that local path registers the provider.

`--from-template` is the only part of `app new` that uses the network, and it fails closed:
`https` only, to an allowlisted host (`codeload.github.com`), no redirects followed at all, a
non-200 refused, and a per-member/whole-archive byte cap. Archive members must be regular
files or directories with relative in-tree paths — a symlink, hardlink, device or `../`
member is refused, and every write path is re-checked for containment after
canonicalisation. An existing non-empty target is refused unless `--force`.
`--template-archive` reads a `.tar.gz` already on disk and touches no network.

## `gideon config`

Get or set configuration values (see the [configuration reference](configuration.md)).

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `config get [KEY]` | Get a value by dot-separated key, or the whole config with no key. |
| `config set KEY VALUE` / `config set --file FILE` | Set a value (validated through the loader) or load a full config from JSON. |
| `config edit` | Open `config.json` in `$EDITOR`. |

## `gideon skills`

Manage skills from the skills marketplace.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skills list` | List locally installed skills. |
| `skills search QUERY [--marketplace skills.sh]` | Search a marketplace. |
| `skills install ID [--marketplace] [--target DIR] [--force]` | Install a skill (e.g. `vercel-labs/agent-skills/next-js`). Installs are supply-chain scanned; `--force` overrides a WARNING verdict — a DANGEROUS verdict is never overridable. |
| `skills remove NAME` | Remove a locally installed skill. |
| `skills curate [--dry-run]` | Groom the `auto/` skill library (age active→stale→archived by last use). |
| `skills verify` | Check installed skills' file hashes against their install baseline (detects post-install tampering). |

## `gideon security`

Security audit and deny list.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `security audit` | Scan conversation history for suspicious tool usage. |
| `security deny-list` | Show active deny patterns. |
| `security events [-n LIMIT]` | Show recent security event log entries (default 20). |
| `security verify` | Verify security event log HMAC integrity. |

## Backup & restore

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gideon snapshot [OUTPUT_DIR] [--keep N] [--list]` | Create a portable backup of Gideon state (keeps the N most recent, default 7; `--list` shows existing snapshots). |
| `gideon restore [SNAPSHOT] [--mode replace\|merge] [--dry-run] [--components LIST] [--list-components] [--force]` | Restore state from a snapshot `.tar.gz`. `--force` restores even while the gateway runs. |
| `gideon backup export [OUT_DIR] [--incremental]` | Export state as **deterministic shards** — canonical JSONL per store plus a SHA-256 manifest, byte-identical for identical state (so it diffs cleanly and syncs without re-uploading unchanged data). Defaults to `<home>/shards`. `--incremental` re-exports only the stores whose content changed. Secrets are never exported. |
| `gideon backup validate [SHARD_DIR]` | Verify an export end to end: the manifest parses, every declared shard exists, and each one's byte length, row count, and SHA-256 re-derive — plus every row re-parses. **Exits non-zero on any problem**, so it works as a cron/CI check. A backup nobody has verified is a hope, not a backup. |

## Inbound surfaces

Gideon can expose a **read-only MCP endpoint** at `POST /mcp` so a local MCP
client (your IDE, an MCP inspector) can ask it questions. It is off by default and
stays off until you both mint a token and flip the flag — and it only answers
loopback callers.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gideon inbound token create mcp [--rotate]` | Mint the surface's bearer token, stored `0600` at `<home>/.inbound_mcp_token`. **Printed once** — copy it into your client immediately. `--rotate` replaces an existing token, which immediately invalidates the old one. |
| `gideon inbound token show mcp` | Report whether a usable token is configured, and why not if it isn't. Deliberately never prints the value: a credential the CLI can re-read is one an unattended process can exfiltrate. Lost it? Rotate. |

Minting a token is not enough on its own — enable the surface too:

```bash
gideon inbound token create mcp        # copy the printed bearer token
gideon config set inbound.mcp.enabled true
```

Both conditions are checked on every request, so setting `inbound.mcp.enabled false`
is an immediate kill switch — no restart needed. When the surface refuses to mount,
the gateway log carries one line naming the exact reason. Every request (allowed or
refused) is recorded in `<home>/inbound_audit.jsonl`, and refusals also land in the
security event log.

Remote access (`inbound.mcp.allow_remote` + `inbound.public_url`) exists but is
**discouraged** until the hardened external-access layer lands. Neither knob is
editable from the dashboard — they are config-file-only on purpose.

## Other commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gideon consolidate KEY \| --all` | Run skill/memory extraction over a session transcript now (the same path the idle poll and session-end triggers use). |
| `gideon discover [--timeout SECS] [--json]` | Find Gideon gateways advertising themselves on the local network (mDNS/DNS-SD `_gideon._tcp`). Prints each one's name and base URL. Finding nothing is a normal result and exits 0 — discovery is opt-in, is a no-op on a loopback-only gateway, and many networks filter multicast. See [Companion apps](../guides/companion-apps.md). |
| `gideon eval [SCENARIOS...] [--all] [--judge]` | Run multi-session evaluation scenarios (default: a ~30s smoke test; `--judge` enables LLM scoring). |
| `gideon mcp-schedule` / `gideon mcp-core` | Internal MCP server entry points spawned by ACP agents — not user-facing (hidden from `--help`). |
