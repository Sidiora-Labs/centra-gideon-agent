# SKILL.md format reference

Gideon reads the same `SKILL.md` files the wider agent-skill ecosystem
writes. This page states exactly what the loader accepts, what it ignores, and
which field is a Gideon extension — so a skill written for another harness
can be dropped in without guesswork, and one written here can be handed out
without surprises.

Everything below was **verified against the parser** (`src/gideon/skills/loader.py`)
rather than inferred from it, and is pinned by `tests/test_skill_format_compat.py`.

## The shape

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md`. The directory path (relative to
the skills root) is the skill's key, so `utils/tiny-url/SKILL.md` is the skill
`utils/tiny-url`. Everything beside `SKILL.md` — scripts, assets, data — is
copied with the skill and reachable from it.

```markdown
---
name: pdf-tools
description: Fill, split and merge PDF files
---

# PDF tools

Body markdown: the instructions the model actually reads.
```

That file — **`name` and `description`, nothing else** — is a complete, valid
skill in Gideon. It is also a complete, valid skill in the vanilla
ecosystem, which is the point.

## Fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | recommended | Display name. Falls back to the directory key when absent. |
| `description` | recommended | One line, shown in listings and used for surfacing. Falls back to the key. |
| `triggers` | no — **Gideon extension** | Phrases that auto-surface the skill. See below. |
| `always` | no | `true` loads the skill on every turn, bypassing trigger matching. |
| `status` | no | `active` (default) or a lifecycle value the curator sets. |

Unknown fields are read and kept, not rejected — a foreign harness's extra
frontmatter is preserved rather than treated as an error, though Gideon
does nothing with it.

### `triggers` is the one extension

`triggers` is **specific to Gideon** and **entirely optional**. It holds
phrases that cause the skill to be offered when a user's message matches:

```yaml
triggers: pdf, fill form, merge documents, !image     # comma-separated
```

```yaml
triggers:                                             # or a YAML block list
  - pdf
  - fill form
```

Both spellings work; the list form is folded to the comma-separated form on read.
A phrase prefixed with `!` is a **negative** trigger — if any negative trigger
matches, the skill is excluded regardless of positive matches.

**A skill with no `triggers` is fully functional.** It lists, loads, and can be
invoked directly or by an agent; it simply never *auto*-surfaces. An empty
`triggers` value means "never auto-surface" — it is never treated as
"matches everything".

## Interoperability

**Importing a foreign skill.** Vanilla `SKILL.md` files import cleanly. The
loader needs only the frontmatter delimiters and reads `name`/`description` when
present. No conversion step, no manifest, no registration.

**Exporting ours.** Another harness consuming a Gideon skill gets
everything except `triggers`, which it will not recognize. Since `triggers` is
metadata about *when to offer* the skill and not part of its instructions, a
foreign harness ignoring it loses auto-surfacing and nothing else — the body
markdown, the scripts, and the description all still apply.

**Practical consequence:** write `triggers` for the benefit of Gideon, and
keep the body self-contained so the skill still reads correctly without it.

## The parser, and its limits

Frontmatter is read by a deliberate **line parser**, not a YAML library — a
~40-line `key: value` reader with no dependency. That choice is intentional
(skills are read on every turn; a YAML parse per skill per turn is not free), but
it means the accepted grammar is narrower than YAML. What that means concretely:

**Tolerated** (each of these used to lose every field, silently):

- a UTF-8 BOM before `---` (Windows editors add one)
- leading blank lines or whitespace before `---`
- CRLF line endings
- single or double quotes around values (stripped)
- a `:` inside a value — `description: Use x: then y` keeps `Use x: then y`
- YAML comment lines (skipped)
- block lists, indented or at column 0 — folded to comma-separated
- block and folded scalars (`|`, `>`, `|-`, `>+`, …) — the indented block is
  folded onto one line, so a multi-line `description` reads correctly

**Not supported** — and these fail *quietly*, so avoid them:

| Construct | What happens (measured, not assumed) |
|---|---|
| Nested mappings | The nested keys are **skipped**, not hoisted. `meta:` with `sub: v` under it yields `meta: ""` and no `sub`. |
| Flow mappings | Kept as raw text: `meta: {k: v}` yields the string `"{k: v}"`. |
| Anchors and aliases | Not interpreted: `name: &x a` yields the string `"&x a"`, and `*x` stays `"*x"`. |
| Duplicate keys | Last one wins. |
| Block scalars keeping line breaks | Folded to one line. `\|` does not preserve newlines here — these fields are single-line by contract. |

If a file lacks frontmatter delimiters entirely, it parses as no metadata and the
skill falls back to its directory key for both name and description. That is a
supported state, not an error.

### Why the tolerance matters

A skill whose frontmatter fails to parse is **not** an obvious failure. It
installs, lists (under its directory key), never trigger-matches, and logs
nothing. From the outside it is indistinguishable from a skill the author simply
never wrote triggers for. That silent-failure mode is why the BOM and
leading-whitespace cases are handled rather than documented as gotchas, and why
`tests/test_skill_format_compat.py` pins each one.
